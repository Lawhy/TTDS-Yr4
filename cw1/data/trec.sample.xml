'FRANK, it flies]' shouted someone at Sir Frank Whittle during the maiden
flight of a British jet. 'Of course it does,' replied Sir Frank, who
patented the first aircraft gas turbine. 'That's what it was bloody well
designed to do, wasn't it?'
Exactly 50 years ago yesterday, the first British jet made a brief 17-minute
flight from RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. To celebrate the event, Mr Eric
'Winkle' Brown, a 72-year-old test pilot of the prototype Gloster Whittle
jet, Mr Geoffrey Bone, a 73-year-old engineer, and Mr Charles McClure, a
75-year-old pilot, returned to RAF Cranwell. They are seen in front of a
restored Meteor NF 11. Sir Frank was unable to attend because of ill-health.
The Gloster Whittle was not the first jet to fly: a Heinkel 178 had its
maiden flight in August 1939, 21 months before the British aircraft.

THE PICTURE of a Gloster Whittle jet on Page 7 of the issue of Tuesday May
14, was taken at Bournemouth Airport and not at RAF Cranwell as stated in

pre-conditions

Correction (published 16th May 1991) appended to this article.
Geevor, the UK mining group which has been fighting for survival since the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce called in a Pounds 2.1m loan in
extraordinary circumstances in January, has suffered another set-back.
Its proposed merger with European Mining Finance, a Luxembourg-quoted
investment company, has run into problems and will not go ahead on the terms
announced in March.
Two of the pre-conditions for the merger have not been satisfied - the
raising of bank finance for the enlarged group and the termination of the
management agreement between EMF and its manager, Lion Mining Finance.
However, Geevor said it remained in talks with EMF and other parties 'which
may result in modified proposals'.
Monarch Resources, the UK-quoted mining group with operations in Venezuela,
has appointed Mr Anthony Ciali as president and chief executive officer.
This follows the recent boardroom shake-up which resulted in the departure
of seven directors and the arrival of Mr Michael Beckett as chairman.
Mr Beckett was managing director of Consolidated Gold Fields and Mr Ciali
was once a vice-president of Gold Fields Mining Corp, a US subsidiary.
Correction (published 16th May 1991).
Lion Mining Finance is not the manager of European Mining Finance as we
reported on May 14.

FT  14 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 2,500 lost in nervous trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH indications of the depth of the UK recession, wavering optimism for
base rate cuts this week and a poor lead from Wall Street all combined to
undermine the UK stock market yesterday.
Pressure for a further reduction in base rates was increased by the news
yesterday that the monthly rise in domestic consumer borrowing was at a
six-year low in March. However, last week's cautionary views on interest
rates from the Bank of England have cast uncertainty over hopes in the City
of London that UK base rates will be cut this Friday in the wake of the
expected fall in the UK retail price index.
Attempts by the equity market to hold on to FT-SE 2,500, reached at the end
of last month, proved fruitless yesterday and the market closed 37.7 points
down at 2,486.6. The final picture was exceedingly gloomy, with the London
market extending its losses to finish virtually at the day's low as Wall
Street continued its overnight fall of 51 Dow points by losing a further
9.39 early in the new session.
Confidence was not helped at the close by sudden rumours that another large
rights issue is in the offing. Institutional coffers are beginning to feel
the weight of a 1991 rights issue burden already approaching Pounds 4bn,
without including a substantial number of share placings.
In the face of Wall Street's heavy setback on Friday night, the London
market opened 23 Footsie points off, quickly abandoning the FT-SE 2,500 mark
attained at the close of business on April 30. There was no significant
recovery during the session but further losses were restrained at first by
the relative absence of sellers and a FT-SE June futures contract which
managed to hold above 2,500 until late in the day. But losses in share
prices were rapidly extended in late trading as the big institutions backed
away from the stock market.
Market volume, as recorded by a Seaq-traded shares total of 354.9m shares,
was low, even by comparison with Friday's 423m figure. The institutions were
believed to be top slicing, selling a small part of their holdings in blue
chip stocks in the expectation that these shares will be bought back more
cheaply in the weeks ahead.
Weakness in oil shares set the trend for widespread losses among Wall
Street-orientated stocks. The industrial blue chips featured falls in BOC,
BAT Industries, Reuters and ICI. However, share losses in the international
sector were mostly suffered early in the session and did not increase
disproportionately after Wall Street opened lower; some analysts commented
that this indicated that domestic factors were the most significant in the
market yesterday.
The uncertain political scene in the UK, ahead of Thursday's by-election in
the Monmouth constituency acted as a further discouragement to the big
institutions, which are increasingly of the view that there will be little
to attract them to the UK stock market until the third quarter of the year.
Trading specialists suggested yesterday that, with their cash holdings
drained by rights issues, the institutions are now less willing to buy cheap
stock whenever the market gives ground. Some believe that fund managers may
wait until the FT-SE falls by a further 50 or more points before making
serious buying forays.
However, optimism for a further strong rise in the UK market over the next
12 months, perhaps to around FT-SE 2,750, remains undimmed.

FT  14 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON derivatives continued to trade under the shadow of Wall Street,
opening weaker following the decline in the US in the previous session and
then slipping still lower as New York extended its slide in London hours
yesterday.
The UK equity futures market began weakly and helped to pull the stock
market down. The premium of the June FT-SE 100 index over the spot index
narrowed from 20 points to around 10 on selling by independent traders.
At one stage, the futures market attempted to rally and succeeded in
widening the gap over the share market to 20 points. But with Wall Street on
the defensive, prices were again marked lower and by the close June was back
to less than a 10-point premium to the spot market.
The June FT-SE closed at 2,494, down 42 points on the day. Its premium
finished at 6 points, against fair value of 15.
In traded options, the stock market's inability to break out of the range of
the past fortnight prompted investors to sell calls against stock holdings.
Elsewhere, there was a buyer of 1,000 Asda July 130 calls; a buyer of 500
GrandMet October 650 puts; and a buyer of 250 Barclays June 460 calls.
The Euro FT-SE was boosted by a seller of 1,000 July 2,625 calls and a buyer
of 1,000 July 2,525 puts.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond recovery fails to bring
joy to equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
THE STOCK market remained subdued yesterday in the wake of last Friday's
sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallying only marginally in
very light trading from the 50-point drop, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow was 4.25 up at 2,924.42, having spent most of the day
in negative territory. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in
similar fashion, recovering 1.02 on balance at 376.76, while the Nasdaq
composite picked up 0.51 to 493.93. Turnover on the New York SE totalled
just 130m shares, while rises showed a small lead over falls at the finish
by 786 to 742.
On Friday it was the sharp fall in bond values which led share prices lower,
but yesterday's modest recovery in the bond market failed to stimulate a
similar movement among stocks. The weakness in the US economy continues to
trouble investors, who can see little reason to invest more of their money
in equities.
Yesterday's industrial production data provided no real comfort on the
economic front. Although the data showed an expected 0.1 per cent increase
in April production, the Federal Reserve also revealed a revised 0.6 per
cent decline in March production, previously estimated at 0.3 per cent.
Banks featured, with American Express dropping Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 22
3/4 on turnover of 4.1m shares after announcing that it would take a Dollars
144m pre-tax charge to account for the 28 per cent stake held by Shearson
Lehman Brothers, its securities subsidiary, in First Capital Holdings, the
troubled Californian life insurance group.
Bankers Trust was down Dollars 1 at Dollars 48 5/8 after the New York-based
banking group confirmed it was laying off 200 staff, while JP Morgan, which
had been actively bought since it was announced over a week ago that the
stock would join the Dow index, slipped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 50 3/8 on
meeting profit-taking.
Square D jumped Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 87 3/8 after the company agreed to
the bid by Schneider, of France, of Dollars 88 a share, or Dollars 2.23bn.
AT&amp;T bucked the trend, firming Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 1/2 in active
trading after reports that the merger with NCR is proceeding faster than
expected.
On the over-the-counter market, Nordstrom jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 44
on turnover of 1.5m shares on the back of an improvement of almost 100 per
cent in first-quarter profits. Apple Computer climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 52 3/4 on volume of 2.2m shares after the company introduced its
System 7 operating system software and said it would cut prices on logic
board upgrades and memory kits for the Macintosh.
Metcalf &amp; Eddy fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 15 1/4 after the water
treatment and waste management company issued a second-quarter profits
warning.
Canada
AFTER spending most of the day in lower territory, the Toronto market
managed a mild recovery during the afternoon to end on a mixed note.
The composite index was finally a net 2.9 up at 3,492.7 but declining issues
still held an edge over advances by 273 to 240. Volume amounted to 21.6m
shares, down from Friday's 23.3m.
Lincoln Waste Management topped the most actives list after one of the
company's largest shareholders and one of its directors sold more than 4m
shares, approaching one-fifth of the session's moderate volume. The share
price was steady at CDollars 10 7/8 .
John Labatt, which rose CDollars 1 to CDollars 23 5/8 , said it is
considering selling its JL Foods Inc unit.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar and yen lose ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell against European currencies but improved in terms of the
Japanese yen yesterday. A rise of 0.1 per cent in April US industrial
production was roughly in line with expectations, while a revised fall of
0.6 per cent from 0.3 per cent in March output brought little reaction in
the US currency.
A decline to 78.3 per cent in April US capacity utilisation, from a downward
revision to 78.5 per cent for March, also had no effect on a market waiting
for today's data on US consumer prices and Friday's trade figures.
At the London close the dollar had fallen to DM1.7140 from DM1.7255; to
FFr5.8050 from FFr5.8400; and to SFr1.4430 from SFr1.4580. On the other hand
it rose to Y139.40 from Y138.75 against a generally weak yen. The dollar's
index dipped to 66.2 from 66.4.
Speculation about an early cut in the Bank of Japan's discount rate
depressed the yen. This helped to boost the D-Mark after rumours subsided
that Mr Karl Otto Pohl was about to resign as president of the German
Bundesbank.
The rumours led to D-Mark nervousness in early trading, but by the end of
the day attention was focused on interest rate factors and this pushed the
German currency up against the yen. It finished in London at Y81.35 compared
with Y80.40 on Friday.
In the European exchange rate mechanism the D-Mark improved against the
weakest placed French franc and also the Italian lira, but lost ground to
sterling.
The Bank of France left its money market intervention rate unchanged at 9
per cent at a securities repurchase tender, keeping interest rate
differentials steady as the Bank of Spain and Belgian National Bank also
left rates unaltered at similar tenders.
The lira weakened against several of its partners in the ERM after Sunday's
one-point cut to 11 1/2 per cent in the Bank of Italy's discount rate.
However, it remained the second strongest ERM currency, according to figures
from the European Commission, in spite of losing ground to the D-Mark,
French franc and other members of the ERM at the Milan fixing.
Sterling was the third strongest ERM currency as speculation continued about
the possible timing of another reduction in UK bank base rates. Mr David
Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, said on BBC radio that 'the
chancellor will not cut interest rates until he considers it prudent to do
so'.
The Bank of England has signalled that it does not consider this an
appropriate time, but the market still believes an early cut is possible as
political pressure increases on the government.
Sterling rose 1.30 cents to Dollars 1.7320, while improving to DM2.9675 from
DM2.9650; to Y241.50 from Y238.50; and to FFr10.0550 from FFr10.0400, but it
eased to SFr2.5000 from SFr2.5075. The pound's index put on 0.2 to 91.8.
Sterling gained a further 20 points in New York to end at Dollars 1.7340.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers' Viewpoint - Machinery
rings seem an all-round success story / The time is coming in the UK for a
co-operative idea already working very well on the Continent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers love government grants. But the flurry of urgent activity in recent
weeks to beat today's deadline for applications for grant aid to help set up
machinery rings has been out of all proportion to their value. There are
much more significant reasons for farmers to co-operate in an effort to cut
the capital costs of machinery. The ending of the modest Pounds 10,000 per
ring grant payable over three years merely concentrated minds.
Machinery rings began in Germany about 25 years ago. Born out of hard times,
they brought together groups of farmers in local areas who were prepared to
work some of their machinery on other people's farms where the appropriate
tackle was worn out or did not exist. In other words, one member of a ring
might provide the combine harvester and deal with the grain on a number of
farms while another would bale the straw and yet another might plough and
plant all the land for the following year's crops.
Rings formalised local arrangements of this kind which had been going on
between farmers in the same village for years and set standard charges for
given tasks. By broadening the area over which such arrangements operated,
it also gave members access to more specialised equipment. By employing a
manager to co-ordinate the work it provided organisation and a guarantee of
payment to those who did the work.
Today, there are about 260 machinery rings in Germany and the idea has
spread to other European countries, especially Holland and France. There
were no rings established in the UK, however, until 1987 after a visit to
Germany by a Scottish agricultural adviser who came home and enthused his
clients over the concept. Since then, 10 machinery rings have been set up in
Scotland.
Although most are still developing and expanding, it is expected that the
total turnover of the Scottish rings this year will reach Pounds 2.5m.
Moreover, the single most successful Scottish group, with 220 members
already, has a turnover in excess of Pounds 1m.
The first English machinery ring was formed in Sussex and Kent only last
year. Since then, 15 more have been established across the country. All have
or are hoping to qualify for the Pounds 10,000 grant, 25 per cent of which
comes from the EC and 75 per cent from the UK government. The scheme is
administered by Food From Britain. At least another two rings are thought to
be in course of formation but they will almost certainly not meet today's
grant deadline.
Within four years, therefore, Britain has gone from no machinery rings to
close to 30 and the majority of them have been set up during the last few
weeks. The ending of the grant had undoubtedly speeded their formation (it
has been available since 1986) but Pounds 3,333 per year for three years
split be-tween perhaps 200-300 farmers is insufficient motivation on its own
for what has happened.
The plain fact is that the machinery ring is an idea whose time has now come
in the UK. To some extent there is an element of following fashion because
the concept has received a great deal of publicity in recent months. The
main reason for the rush of activity, however, is declining farm profits and
the realisation by a growing number of farmers that they must cut their
costs to survive in business.
On average, the so-called 'variable costs' of running a farm - the money
spent on seeds, fertilisers, sprays and so on - amount to between 35 per
cent and 40 per cent of total costs. Fixed costs account for the remaining
60 per cent to 65 per cent and cover such things as labour, interest
charges, power and machinery.
In recent years, as margins have declined, some of these 'fixed costs' have
had to become variable as numbers of farmworkers have diminished either
through natural wastage or redundancy and as assets have been sold to reduce
borrowings and, therefore, interest charges. Power costs are more difficult
to control in the face of fluctuating oil prices while real depreciation on
machinery values can be horrendous.
Indeed, the depreciation rates typically used in farm accounts may well be
insufficient to allow for the replacement of machines whose purchase prices
continue to rise with inflation.
Add to that the fact that many farms are over-mechanised for the
understandable reason that farmers like to feel on top of any job, whatever
the weather, and it is clear that economies in machinery costs are overdue
in the current financial climate.
The machinery ring has obviously been recognised as a possible solution. For
Pounds 50 per year membership charge and a modest purchase of share capital,
a farmer can plug into a source of extra income or extra help, whichever he
prefers. Commission charges of 2 per cent are levied on both the demander
and the provider of the work to cover the costs of the co-ordinator and his
computer. Otherwise, the charges for work are set at similar rates to the
most competitive contractors.
Experience shows, apparently, that most rings lose money in their first year
or two but that as the organisation develops and as members begin to review
their machinery replacement policies, the flow of work offered and done
builds up dramatically. Indeed, it is possible to foresee situations where
some farmers decide to buy bigger machines than they can justify in order to
earn extra cash working on other members' farms. At the same time, other
farmers may see opportunities to earn more money off the farm and be pleased
to pay a ring member to do most of his farm work.
The pattern is already established in Germany, albeit on smaller farms than
are typical in the UK. It is yet another step towards the establishment of
significant numbers of part-time farmers in this country. In any event,
those groups of farmers who have their machinery rings up and running are
convinced that there is a potential for many more.
A couple of weeks ago, there was a meeting of machinery ring leaders at the
National Agricultural Centre at Stoneleigh, in Warwickshire. They decided to
set up an Association of Machinery Rings to guide those who come after and
to lobby on behalf of members on such things as the presently-restricted use
of red, tax-free diesel fuel in tractors travelling more than 15 miles from
their home base. They see this as a possible inhibition to the efficient
working of rings which may cover an area 30 to 40 miles wide.
The success of the concept relies on the willing co-operation of farmers. In
this country, agricultural co-operation, with a few notable exceptions, has
seldom succeeded beyond the first flush of enthusiasm. I believe this
machinery ring version of co-operation will work. In any case, the other day
I signed up to join one.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME monitors copper market as
squeeze tightens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange executive yesterday said it was carefully
monitoring events in the copper market where a technical squeeze has been
causing severe volatility.
As the squeeze reached its climax yesterday the price of borrowing (buying
cash and selling forward) for one day reached Pounds 40 a tonne.
During recent upheavals in the zinc market, the LME executive persuaded
those with metal to lend to restrict the cost of borrowing for a day to
Dollars 20 a tonne and some dealers asked last night why the cost of
borrowing copper had been allowed to rise much more substantially.
Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's director of marketing, said: 'Our duty is to run
an orderly market - not to limit the cost of borrowing or the back-wardation
(the premium for metal for immediate delivery compared with the three-month
price).'
Copper's backwardation widened to Pounds 100 a tonne at one stage yesterday
and traders said this would continue to stimulate a flood of the metal into
LME warehouse stocks. Copper stocks already stood at 261,775 tonnes at the
weekend, the highest total for seven years, and traders estimated that
today's stock report would show a further increase of about 10,000 tonnes.
Mr Abbott said however, that, although the LME's copper stocks were
relatively high, it would be wrong to assume that all the metal was
available to be sold on the market. The owners might well be 'parking' the
copper briefly in LME warehouses.
The copper market was going through a 'choppy period' of volatility because
there was still a split of opinion about whether there would be a surplus
this year, Mr Abbott suggested. This choppiness could go on for some time
before there was a clear consensus of opinion about the fundamental
direction of the market.
However, many analysts now insist that the recession which is begining to
make its mark on even the strongest economies will far outweigh any
interruptions to copper supplies this year.
In the latest Metals and Mining Monthly Update from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken,
part of the Banque Indosuez Group, analyst Mr Robin Bhar says key copper
consuming sectors in the US (construction, autos and capital goods) will
remain depressed and consumption in Germany is likely to be restrained by
slowing economic growth caused by the mounting costs of reunification.
Consequently, says Mr Bhar, copper stocks will keep rising during 1991 and
the price is likely to fall decisively below Dollars 1 a lb, perhaps to
between 70 cents and 80 cents a lb. The dollar price ended at Dollars 1.04 a
lb last night.
In sterling terms, cash copper ended at Pounds 1,443 a tonne, down Pounds
6.50 from Friday's close, while three-month metal was Pounds 1,346, down
Pounds 11.50.

deal

TOTAL, THE French state-controlled oil group, has signed a FFr3bn (Dollars
512m) agreement with Sonatrach, Algeria's state oil company, for the
development of the Hamra gas field, writes George Graham in Paris.
The French group will provide financing and technological assistance for the
development of the field, expected to start production in 1994.
In return, Total will have access to Hamra's entire output of condensates
and liquefied petroleum gas - an estimated 150m to 200m barrels petroleum
equivalent - for a period of 14 to 17 years.
The deal shows the continued willingness of big Western companies to invest
in Algeria, despite the political uncertainty that has been hanging over the
country's future since the rise of the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation
Front.
Total also agreed yesterday to renew for a further five years its joint
venture with Sonatrach for the operation of the Mereksen oil field, which
currently produces around 600,000 tonnes of oil a year. It also signed two
exploration contracts covering 6,458 square kilometres at Djebel Bottena and
Hamra Southeast.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fuel cell use is predicted for
platinum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUEL CELLS, environmentally friendly units which produce electricity and
heat from a controlled chemical reaction be-tween hydrogen and oxygen, are
likely to provide the next substantial industrial application for platinum,
according to Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group.
By the end of this century about 200,000 troy ounces of platinum a year
could be ab-sorbed by this new market - about the same as the chemical and
electrical industries each use today, JM suggests in its annual review of
the market.
However, this could be a conservative estimate. If fuel cells incorporating
platinum catalysts are used and if the market develops as projected by the
Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, annual demand for
platinum in that country alone by the year 2010 would be more than 400,000
ounces.
'Beyond the turn of the century platinum consumption could soar, should the
market for fuel cells in vehicles materialise and dreams of a hydrogen
economy become a reality,' says Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of the JM review.
The fuel cell is a prime contender to meet demand for electricity without
increasing pollution, he points out. It is versatile and efficient, produces
hardly any noxious emissions and so could help to re-solve the apparent
conflict between continued economic growth and the preservation of a healthy
environment.
Fuel cells went into commercial production for the first time last year.
Japan is showing the most commitment to their development. The Japanese
government is spending about Dollars 27m a year on research, and Fuji
Electric, Toshiba and Sanyo have developed marketable products and
established production lines to build them.
The US Department of Energy is currently spending Dollars 44m a year on fuel
cell research while spending in Europe is about Dollars 60m. By 1995 more
than 100 fuel cells will be installed and producing power in Europe, Japan,
the US and the Far East.
Mr Coombes says commercial units should be available in 1993 at a cost of
Dollars 1,500 per kilowat of generating capacity, not much more than the
cost from conventional generating plant, and the cost is likely to fall as
more fuel cells are built.
On the main features of the platinum market last year, the JM review
reports:
Demand for platinum in-creased by 5.5 per cent to a record 3.66m ounces.
Supplies rose by 9 per cent to 3.73m ounces.
The market moved into marginal oversupply of 70,000 ounces from a marginal
undersupply of 45,000 ounces in 1989. The slight oversupply might continue
for some years.
Supplies from South Africa, the world's biggest producer, were constrained
by production difficulties but grew modestly. Shipments to the west from the
Soviet Union, at 700,000 ounces, were the highest for 15 years.
This year JM expects platinum to trade at about Dollars 400 an ounce before
rising as the year progresses towards Dollars 450.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Citicorp in asset-backed
launch worth Dollars 1.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP yesterday launched its first global asset-backed bond issue since
August last year, a Dollars 1.4bn deal backed by a portfolio of credit card
receivables.
The progress of the deal confirmed that investors are once again willing to
buy asset-backed securities. This will encourage other financial
institutions looking to remove consumer finance assets from their balance
sheets through securitised bond offerings.
The five-year deal, lead-managed by Salomon Brothers, is backed by credit
card receivables in Citicorp's 'master trust' of credit card accounts.
The main portion of the deal, at Dollars 1.25bn, carries a triple-A credit
rating by virtue of an additional Dollars 155m subordinated tranche which
will absorb any initial losses of the master trust.
The deal will be priced today, with the senior notes at an indicated yield
spread of between 95 and 99 basis points over five-year US Treasury paper.
The subordinated bonds, which carry an A-2/A credit rating from US credit
rating agencies Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, will be priced at around 145
basis points over US Treasuries.
The lead manager said most of the international market tranche of the deal
was placed with institutional investors based in London. However, US
investors remain dominant buyers of mortgage-backed bonds, and most of the
subordinated paper was placed in the US.
Citicorp's last asset-backed deal in the international bond market was
launched in November. The deal was then priced to yield 90 basis points over
US Treasury securities, but the bonds traded out to well over 100 basis
points after launch.
Market sentiment, however, has been firmer over the past two months, and the
deal's pricing was considered attractive. In addition, the deal had been
widely anticipated in the market, and many investors had set aside funds to
buy the bonds. Demand was dominated by institutional investors.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: Gilts follow Treasuries' fall in auction
aftermath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

UK GOVERNMENT bonds plummeted yesterday morning, responding to the sharp
fall in the US Treasury bond market on Friday afternoon.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2003/07 opened at 110 9/32
and fell to a low of 109 1/2 before recovering in the afternoon.
Traders said the disappointing UK credit business figures released
yesterday, which were slightly higher than market expectations, may have
helped to depress prices.
The gilts market is this week waiting for the release of several important
economic indicators which could determine whether the Bank of England
decides to cut the base rate. These include the producer prices index for
April today, the unemployment figures on Thursday, and the retail prices
index on Friday.
THE US government bond market remained unsettled yesterday in the wake of
Friday's frenzied sell-off, but prices at the long end did gain ground on
the back of some sporadic buying.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was up 1 7/32 at 98
13/32 , to yield 8.264 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 5/16
, yielding 6.808 per cent. Trading activity was exceptionally light.
Dealers and investors continued to digest the implications of the dramatic
fall in prices which followed last week's difficult auction of Dollars 37bn
in government securities. With a large chunk of that paper still to be
distributed, analysts were not expecting any significant recovery in bond
values in the near term.
The day's only economic news had little impact on sentiment. The Federal
Reserve reported that industrial production rose 0.1 per cent in April,
after falling a revised 0.6 per cent in March.
THE Italian government bond market jumped yesterday following the
one-percentage point cut in the discount rate at the weekend.
The cut, from 12.5 to 11.5 per cent, followed the cabinet's approval of
L14,000bn in spending cuts and revenue increases to curb the public deficit.
Yields fell across the range of maturities as retail buyers scrambled to buy
bonds. The yield on the 12.5 per cent bond due 2001 fell from 13.35 per cent
to 13.07 per cent.
The Bank of Italy's decision to cut the reserve requirement on the net
increase in banks' and credit institutions' foreign currency deposits, with
effect from the June reserve month, was seen as a bullish factor by the
market. The move should free around L5,000bn of funds for use by the credit
system.
The cut in the Italian discount rate buoyed hopes of interest rate cuts in
the Spanish and French government bond markets
The Spanish bond market saw strong buying interest among the shorter-dated
maturities. The yield on Spain's 13.45 per cent government bond due April
1996 fell from 11.91 to 11.82 per cent as foreign buyers moved in, hoping to
benefit from an expected cut in the intervention rate.
The Bank of Spain left its key money market rate unchanged at 13.5 per cent
at its repurchase tender for central bank certificates. Traders said that
this was disappointing, but did not rule out the possibility of an interest
rate cut soon.
Other European government bond markets opened weak in the wake of the US
Treasury bond market's fall on Friday.
The German market was haunted yet again by the rumour that Bundesbank
president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, may step down. Bund prices fell after the US
decline, with the longer maturities taking the brunt of the fall. Despite
some buying interest in short and medium-dated bunds, they ended almost
unchanged on the day.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied as a fall in short-term interest rates
rekindled hopes of a cut in the official discount rate.
The overnight unsecured call rate was cut from 8 3/16 to 8 1/16 per cent,
while the rate on three-month certificates of deposit fell from 7.9 to 7.83
per cent. The fall was interpreted by some traders as a possible sign of the
Bank of Japan easing monetary policy. The yen weakened against the dollar
due to the lower interest rates, and traders said the Bank of Japan
intervened to buy yen and sell dollars yesterday.
The bond rally was short-lived, and JGB prices closed almost unchanged as
attention later in the day focused on a number of Euroyen issues, including
one of Y50bn by the World Bank. The benchmark No 129 JGB opened with a yield
of 6.635 per cent, moving to 6.605 per cent before closing in Tokyo at 6.63.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of the Barclays group,
has obtained a seat on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange through its
newly-acquired German investment bank, Merck, Finck, writes David Lascelles,
Banking Editor.
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (S-E-Banken) will use the trading name
Scandinvanian Bank for its branch in London. S-E-Banken bought Scandinavian
Banking Group, the London consortium bank, last year and its licence is
being surrendered.

<TEXT>
USF&amp;G, the large but troubled US insurance group, yesterday revealed plans
to bolster its capital base by raising up to Dollars 300m through issues of
convertible preferred stock.
Last month, the Baltimore-based multiline insurer said that it would cut its
workforce by around a quarter in a major 'downsizing' of its business.
It is also in the midst of reorganising its operational structure so that
its commercial and personal lines become two separate businesses with
independent profit centres.
The company announced a Dollars 569m loss last year, and has already cut its
quarterly dividend from 73 cents a share to 5 cents a share.
A new chairman, Mr Norman Blake, was brought into the company in November,
and other management changes have followed.
USF&amp;G said yesterday that the majority of the proceeds of the new issues
would be used 'to strengthen the surplus of the primary unit, United States
Fidelity and Guaranty Company'.
It anticipated that the funds would be raised via the issue of two series of
convertible prefered stock. These would be sold to investors both through a
public offering and through a separate private placement.

<TEXT>
TOYODA Automatic Loom Works, a leading member of the Toyota Motor group,
reported an 11.1 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y30.2bn (Dollars
218.84m) for the year to end-March, as sales of automobile assembly
equipment rose with the expansion of vehicle production at Toyota.
The company, the first founded of the Toyota group, reported an 18.8 per
cent increase in sales to Y583.69bn, with a 33.5 per cent surge in textile
machinery sales, a 28.2 per cent rise in automobile assembly equipment, and
an 8.8 per cent improvement in industrial vehicles.
Company officials said personnel expenses rose during the year because of
Japan's labour shortage, and earnings were affected by the increase in the
country's interest rates, but they added that the advance in sales more than
compensated for those costs.
However, Japan's vehicle market has softened and export markets are also
troubled, so sales for this year are expected to rise only 4.5 per cent to
Y610bn, while pre-tax profit is predicted to fall 2.3 per cent to Y29.5bn,
the first fall in five years.
Toyota Tsusho, a trading arm of the Toyota group, reported a 10.8 per cent
lift in sales to Y2,163bn, while pre-tax profit increased 4.5 per cent to
Y16.16bn.
Domestic sales advanced 10.4 per cent, while foreign trade increased 11.6
per cent, with exports up 19 per cent, imports down 0.5 per cent, and trade
between third world countries up 16.4 per cent.
The company expects a 6.2 per cent increase in sales to Y2,300bn this year
and an 11.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Y18bn, despite higher labour
costs and a heavier interest payment burden.
Another Toyota affiliate, Aisin Seiki, is expecting a decline in recurring
profit from the Y20.2bn in the year to end-March, up 1.1 per cent on 1989,
to around Y17bn for the present year.
The company announced yesterday that sales for the year to end-March rose
14.5 per cent to Y525bn, with those of automobile parts up 14.8 per cent to
Y495.7bn and household machinery rising 10.1 per cent to Y29.2bn.
Sales for the current year are expected to increase 4.7 per cent to Y550bn,
but the expected downturn in profits is attributed to the sluggish car
market, and increased depreciation and personnel expenses.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based retailer managed by the founding Nordstrom
family, yesterday turned in sharply higher first-quarter earnings and said
it had settled federal and state securities class action lawsuits for
Dollars 7.5m.
Mr John Goesling, Nordstrom's senior vice-president, said the results
'compare favourably with what we regarded as a disappointing performance
during the previous year's first quarter.'
Net income leapt 95 per cent to Dollars 25.7m, or 31 cents a share, from
Dollars 13.2m, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Net sales grew 10 per cent in
the three months to Dollars 610.6m from Dollars 555m.
Shares in Nordstrom jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 44 yesterday in active
over-the-counter trading. The company attributed its improved performance to
improving sales trends, better management of inventories and steps taken in
the previous year to reduce operating expenses.
During the quarter, Nordstrom reduced its selling, general and
administrative expenses to 27.65 per cent of sales from 29.4 per cent a year
earlier.
Pre-tax earnings jumped 101 per cent to Dollars 41.4m, or 6.77 per cent of
sales, from Dollars 20.6m, or 3.71 per cent of sales, a year earlier.
Nordstrom also said yesterday that it had settled a number of lawsuits
alleging that the company and six of its officers failed to disclose that
Nordstrom might be liable for additional employee compensation arising from
Nordstrom's past employee practices.
In the last year, Nordstrom's reputation has been clouded by a union dispute
and by revelations that the company's commission sales force is not properly
compensated.
Mr Goesling said: 'While we have not yet resolved with our insurance company
their share of this settlement, we are confident that any payment made by
the company will not have a material effect on the results of operations for
the year.'
The settlement, which is subject to court approval, provides for payment of
Dollars 7.5m to shareholders who bought Nordstrom stock between February 1
1988 and March 8 1990.

THE TWO state-owned Venezuelan airlines due to be privatised this year
suffered financial losses in 1990, according to figures published by the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications.
Viasa, the government's international flag-carrier, lost USDollars 34m in
1990 on overall revenues of Dollars 268m, compared with Dollars 4.6m profit
in 1989 on revenues of Dollars 266.7m.
Another state-owned airline, Aeropostal, which flies domestic and
international routes, suffered a 1990 loss of Dollars 7.3m on revenues of
Dollars 82.1m.
In 1989, Aeropostal reported net earnings of Dollars 2.8m on revenues which
totalled Dollars 68.8m. (Dollar figures were calculated using free-market
exchange rates for the Venezuelan bolivar at the end of each year.)
The government of President Carlos Andres Perez is keen to privatise Viasa
and Aeropostal this year to demonstrate that its slow-moving privatisation
programme is finally getting off the ground.
Since the government took office over two years ago, it has privatised only
two commercial banks from a long list of companies it plans to sell off.

The group entered the US water heaters market in 1989 thorough the purchase

The deal, which is subject to US regulatory approval, is expected to be

FLETCHER Challenge (FCL) yesterday announced it had successfully placed
NZDollars 195m (USDollars 115m) worth of shares with international
institutional investors in a move designed to ease its debt burden.
However, the company did not announce the fate of a further 25m shares which
were being offered as oversubscriptions and were not underwritten. It is
hoped these shares would raise the total to NZDollars 292.5m.
News of the unexpected placement forced the share prices sharply lower
yesterday, ending a month-long rally. FCL dropped 22 cents to NZDollars
3.92, which was 2 cents above the placement price for the 50m shares. The
placement was underwritten by brokers CS First Boston NZ and Potter Warburg
Markets.
Mr Hugh Fletcher, FCL chief executive officer, said the placement showed
international investors strongly supported the New Zealand company which has
diverse holdings in the forestry products and building materials industries.
An FCL spokesman said the additional funds would represent a reduction in
group debt levels of about 1.4 per cent.
The company last month revised its forecasts, warning that full-year profits
might be about 10 per cent below the NZDollars 662.4m for the year to June
30 1990.
FCL, the second largest newsprint producer in the world, has suffered from
declining demand for its paper and a drop in prices for pulp and timber.
The spokesman said capital spending peaked last year at NZDollars 1.3bn and
was expected to fall to about NZDollars 800m. He said the group had to sell
all its property interests, valued at about NZDollars 500m held through
Fletcher Construction and Challenge Properties.

THE privatisation of Aerolneas Argentinas, the Argentine national airline,
entered its final phase yesterday, six months after the government and an
international consortium exchanged contracts.
The consortium, led by Spain's Iberia, delivered Dollars 810m-worth of
foreign debt certificates to the government as part of an agreement reached
between the two sides in April.
The privatisation stalled earlier this year after the government and
consortium members squabbled over the terms of the contract. The buyers
refused to pay, while the government refused to deliver the 85 per cent of
Aerolineas shares on sale.
Under the new agreement, the consortium agreed to deliver Dollars 1.61bn in
foreign debt paper in two tranches. It has also provided satisfactory
guarantees from international banks underpinning its Dollars 540m investment
plan in Aerolneas, as required by the original contract.
Earlier, the buyers paid Dollars 142m in government dollar-denominated bonds
worth 68 per cent of face value on the local market, replacing Dollars 130m
in deferred payments due under the original contract.

JOHN LABATT, the Canadian food and beverage group, is putting a large part

concentrating on beer, entertainment and dairy products.
Labatt, which is 39 per cent owned by the Brascan group controlled by Peter

JLFoods, which specialises in frozen grocery products in Canada, the US and
Britain. JLFoods is the leading supplier of frozen soup in the US, and also

The company has annual sales of USDollars 475m and employs 3,500 people at
13 manufacturing and processing plants, most of them in the US.
Analysts said the sale could fetch about USDollars 300m. The company, which
had sales of CDollars 5.3bn (USDollars 4.6bn) last year, has made no secret
of its eagerness to expand its beer business outside Canada.

APPLE Computer has intro- duced new software for its Macintosh personal
computers with which the company aims to counter competition from
Microsoft's popular Windows program and boost its share of the personal
computer market.
Apple's new System 7 is an enhanced version of the Macintosh operating
system, the program that controls the basic functions of a computer.
The new software 'raises the bar' in what customers will expect from a
personal computer, claimed Mr John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief
executive.
'Macintosh system software is Apple's greatest strength, and we intend to
use this advantage aggressively to become a much bigger player in the
industry,' he said.
'System 7 sets a new standard, thereby widening the gap between what one can
do with a computer, and what one can do with a Macintosh.'
The system includes a new graphical user interface that makes the Macintosh
easier to use, as well as features that enhance the Macintosh's ability to
perform several tasks simultaneously. New Macintosh buyers will get System 7
free with their computers. Most current Macintosh users, however, will have
to upgrade their computers to take advantage of the new software.
System 7 will be offered in the US for Dollars 99. Apple USA also announced
price cuts on the add-on processor and memory boards that will be needed to
upgrade older Macintosh models. The introduction of System 7 demonstrates
that 'Apple is on the offensive,' Mr Sculley claimed.
Many, however, view the software launch as a defensive move aimed at
Microsoft's Windows program which provides IBM-compatible personal computers
with many of the ease-of-use features of the Apple Macintosh.
Apple acknowledged that the introduction of System 7 was delayed for over a
year by technical difficulties.
Although existing Macintosh applications programs will run on System 7,
there are few new programs designed to take full advantage of the new
operating system, analysts noted.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Temporary rescue for French
group

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VEV, the struggling French textiles group, yesterday agreed to the terms of
a temporary financial lifeboat worked out by the French government with
VEV's bank creditors in a bid to save the company from outright bankruptcy.
The government and banks will together finance VEV's immediate cash needs
for one month - FFr100m (Dollars 17.1m) to FFr250m - while the banks have
agreed to concessions on a portion of their loans to the debt-ridden group.
At the same time, Mr Christian Derveloy, VEV's chairman, is to resign, and
an audit will be undertaken to see if the textiles group can survive.
The government has been anxious to avert the collapse of a group which
employs 11,000 people, many of them in areas of northern France which
already suffer high unemployment. The Interministerial Committee for
Industrial Reconstruction (CIRI), a unit of the Finance Ministry, has
supervised negotiations between VEV and its banks.
An agreement hammered out over the weekend provides for the bank creditors
to abandon an estimated FFr250m of short-term debt and to convert some
FFr500m of medium-term debt into participating loans.
The banks have also been asked to give up their claim on the shares of a
number of VEV's subsidiaries pledged as security for their loans. This
should facilitate the break-up of the group, if this proves necessary, as
most Paris bankers now fear.
VEV has already sold several of its most profitable subsidiaries, such as
Jalla, Pennel &amp; Flipo and Gravograph, in a bid to reduce its debt burden,
which totalled FFr3.3bn at the end of 1989.
Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank, is the most heavily exposed creditor,
with loans understood to total more than FFr1.2bn. Other creditors include
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), Societe Generale, Credit Commercial de
France (CCF), Credit du Nord and Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur
(BFCE).
The banks had earlier flatly refused to accept much broader concessions
proposed by the CIRI.
VEV emerged in 1987 out of the ashes of the Prouvost group, which Mr
Derveloy then managed. Using VEV as his vehicle, Mr Derveloy not only beat
off a stock market assault on Prouvost by the Chargeurs group, but also won
control of the group away from the Prouvost family which had hired him.
Although he succeeded in this battle, Mr Derveloy is generally thought to
have got the worse of a peace deal with Chargeurs signed the following year,
through which he gave up Prouvost's profitable wool trading and carding
operations to Chargeurs, keeping its textiles and clothing divisions.
Mr Regis Bello, formerly chief executive of the A. Dewavrin Fils group, was
expected yesterday to replace Mr Derveloy at the head of the group. Mr
Derveloy was expected to offer to sell his 5.4 per cent VEV stake for a
symbolic FFr1.
VEV's board was due yesterday to finalise 1990's accounts, which are
expected to show a loss of over FFr500m. By yesterday evening, however, the
results had not yet been published.

<TEXT>
POWER Corporation, the Dublin-based property development company, has
announced pre-tax profits for 1990 up from IPounds 10.26m to IPounds 15.59m,
or Pounds 14m sterling.
Turnover increased 13.5 per cent to IPounds 35.12m. After tax of IPounds
3.38m (IPounds 2.31m) earnings per share came out at 10.54p, compared with
8.65p. Mr Robin Power, chairman, said that the company had performed
exceptionally well given the difficult market conditions.
'We are the only property company quoted on the UK market to have achieved
results in line with forecasts of 14 months ago. This is due to the spread
of business between Ireland, the UK and the US.'
The company said the value of its property portfolio at the end of 1990
stood at IPounds 352m, up from IPounds 33m when the company came to the
market at the end of 1987. An independent valuation resulted in net assets
per share of 198p at the year end, compared with 207p.
Power has been involved with Brent Walker, the troubled leisure
conglomerate, in the Trocadero site in central London and in the Blackpool
Tower shopping centre.
Mr Power said that the deal with Brent Walker, involving the swapping of
Brent's 50 per cent stakes in the two developments and Power's 50 per cent
stake in the Island site adjacent to the Trocadero, was still subject to
some consents. 'We had expected things to be finalised two weeks ago but
there have been some hold ups.'
He added that the company intended to retain only 50 per cent of the
Trocadero. When the development was completed and an attractive price could
be obtained the 50 per cent from Brent would be disposed of.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Brent Walker shares drop ahead of loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT Walker's shares tumbled yesterday as the heavily borrowed leisure
group confirmed that losses last year would lead to a 'major reduction in
shareholders' funds'.
The company has also delayed announcement of its preliminary results from
tomorrow until next Monday. Brent Walker's shares closed 16p lower at 40p.
'Although the group produced profits at the operating level, it sustained a
substantial loss for the year after taking into account interest,
exceptional items and taxation,' the company said. It made a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 82.2m in the year to December 1989.
The delay in the 1990 results pushes back publication of the financial
restructuring plan Brent Walker is thrashing out with Hill Samuel, the
merchant bank acting as its advisers.
The steering committee of creditor banks, led by Standard Chartered, has yet
to see a Touche Ross report on Brent Walker's assets and liabilities on
which the package will be based. The firm was asked last November for the
report when the banks agreed a standstill on Pounds 1.4bn of debt. Banks
expect a write-down in Brent Walker's asset values of Pounds 1bn to about
Pounds 100m net of debt.

FT  14 MAY 91 / TVS unveils plan to raise equity as it falls into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TVS Entertainment, the ITV company for the south of England, yesterday
announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.3m and cancelled the final dividend at
the same time as unveiling plans to raise new equity.
The new equity will, however, only become available if TVS retains its
lucrative and hotly-contested southern franchise.
TVS declined to give any details on this before tomorrow's deadline for bids
for new 10-year franchises beginning in 1993.
The financial package will include a new shareholder and promises of further
investment from the company's existing French shareholders, Canal Plus, the
subscription channel and Generale d'Images, the communications company.
TVS would need the capital injection to fulfil its programme obligations
because of the losses sustained in the 1988 acquisition of MTM, the US
production company, in a Dollars 320m (Pounds 189m) deal.
At least three well-funded bidders are going for the TVS franchise - MAI,
the marketing and financial services group, Mr Michael Green's Carlton
Communications and the David Frost/Richard Branson joint venture.
TVS yesterday announced losses arising out of a poor performance from the US
group. TVS made a profit of Pounds 16.8m in the year to end-December,
compared with a profit of Pounds 20.8m in the 14 months to the end of 1989.
However, an exceptional provision of Pounds 20.7m was made against US
programme stock. MTM had four new series cancelled by the US networks last
year - Capital News, FM, City and You Take the Kids. In addition, Pounds
4.4m has been set aside for further redundancies.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 4m, against an extraordinary gain of
Pounds 30.4m a year earlier, resulted in a net loss of Pounds 10.1m, or
17.6p a share, compared with a net profit of Pounds 40m, or 8.8p per share.
Turnover was Pounds 262.1m (Pounds 325.5m).
Earlier this year, TVS tried to sell MTM, famous for programmes such as Hill
Street Blues and St Elsewhere. Despite much interest, no one would pay more
than Dollars 70m. MTM has been withdrawn from the market.
In Britain, TVS increased its share of ITV advertising revenue to 11.4 per
cent - the highest in its history.
The decision that TVS is 'unable to pay further dividends' means that the
interim payout of 3p in November is the final one.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Severn Trent to pay Pounds 212m for BET unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERN TRENT, the water company, has agreed to pay Pounds 212m to win Biffa,
one of the UK's leading waste disposal concerns, from BET, the debt-laden
business services group.
The deal means Severn Trent will finally gain a significant presence in
waste management. Last year, Severn Trent decided not to proceed with an
earlier attempt to do so by taking over Caird, a listed company.
BET put Biffa up for sale three months ago, as part of a review of its
funding capabilities and management structure.
Analysts yesterday expected the company's net debt to fall to about Pounds
250m after completion of the sale, which produced proceeds at the top end of
market expectations.
Mr John Bellak, Severn Trent's chairman, said: 'We are delighted to have
been able to buy such a good business at a fair price.'
Mr Nicholas Wills, BET's chairman, said a range of potential acquirers and
joint venture partners had shown interest.
Severn Trent's shares closed 3p down at 277p and BET's were 2p lower at 178p
yesterday.
Biffa, one of the largest presences in the UK waste management business,
made profits before interest of Pounds 17.8m on sales of Pounds 102.3m in
the year to the end of March. No debt is being taken on with Biffa. Mr
Bellak said Severn Trent would be funding it through borrowings incurred by
its public limited company.
The deal intensified speculation about the fate of the 29.9 per cent stake
in Caird with which Severn Trent was left after it dropped its bid last
October, when Caird cut its profit forecast.
Mr Bellak insisted yesterday that all options remained open. Caird's shares
closed unchanged at 75p.
Mr Bellak said that, once Biffa was aligned with the company's existing
business, waste would account for about 15 per cent of total group turnover.
For BET, the sale comes at the end of a turbulent spring which saw a bear
raid on its shares early in February.
A new chief executive, Mr John Clark, took over last month from Mr Wills.
BET has said that it wanted to dispose of Biffa because of the risks arising
from its exposure to environmental legislation.
Mr Martin Bettington stays on as managing director of Biffa, which is best
known for its UK collection and landfill activities.
Using experience acquired in their core water business as a basis for
assuming a wider role in waste management has been a priority for most of
the 10 water companies since they were privatised in November 1989. Severn
Trent's is the biggest step taken in the sector to date.
In February, Wessex Water announced a Pounds 125m joint venture with Waste
Management of the US, one of the world's biggest treatment and disposal
groups.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Drexel details settlement plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DREXEL Burnham Lambert, the US investment bank which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection 15 months ago, yesterday revealed details of a complex
settlement plan.
Under the agreement, Drexel's estate will be split between creditors and
parties making claims against it under securities law.
The settlement plan comes after judicial pressure to avoid a lengthy,
litigious liquidation.
There are still hurdles but lawyers in the case suggest it could be over by
early 1992, leaving a small 20-person concern to handle Drexel's illiquid
assets.
Under the agreement, the estate - reckoned at more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.15bn) - is divided so that:
Administrative costs of the bankruptcy will be paid first, followed by
Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m of secured claims and a further Dollars 150m
payment into the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil disgorgement
fund;
The next Dollars 1.3bn is split 85:15 between fixed creditors and securities
litigants;
The next Dollars 700m is split 60:40 between the same parties; Thereafter,
the split is 50:50.
About Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m of particularly illiquid assets will go into
a a new entity to be owned by a 'liquidating trust'. This seems likely to be
sold eventually.
Under the plan, all securities litigation against Drexel would cease and
some 200 Drexel employees - though not Mr Fred Joseph, the former chief
executive - would be released from any new litigation claims.
Drexel will also 'pool' its own legal actions with those of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, which regulates the troubled thrift industry,
and certain securities litigants, in cases where there is a common
defendant. This joint effort could apply in claims against former Drexel
employees, in particular Mr Michael Milken, who headed the lucrative junk
bond operation.
Drexel will get 14 per cent of money collected from such litigation, up to
Dollars 400m.
Perhaps the biggest hurdle is the Internal Revenue Service, which has filed
a Dollars 5.3bn claim and is not included in the settlement plan. Unless a
deal can be struck with the IRS, the merits of this claim will be heard by
the courts next month. If they grant an award above a certain sum -
undisclosed - the settlement agreement could be aborted.

FT  14 MAY 91 / US economic hopes rise as output level stabilises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US INDUSTRIAL production stabilised in April after six months of decline,
bolstering hopes that the recession may be bottoming out.
A rise of 0.1 per cent in industrial output, while no more than a tentative
pointer, follows other mildly encouraging statistics, including a slower
rate of decline in employment, an increase in the index of leading
indicators and the start of a housing recovery.
The better figures for April, however, were accompanied by revisions to
previous statistics. The Federal Reserve said production fell 0.6 per cent
in March - twice as much as initially estimated. In the first quarter,
industrial production fell at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.6 per
cent.
The tiny increase in output last month does not signal that the US recession
is over but it suggests that the rate of decline has eased significantly.
Most forecasters expect the US economy to hit bottom sometime during the
summer and then to begin a weak recovery.
Last month's improvement was led by car and truck production, which
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 10.8 per cent. This sector
was the biggest depressing influence on the economy in the previous six
months.
Excluding motor vehicles, industrial production fell 0.2 per cent last
month. The weakness was concentrated in non-durable goods, mining and
utilities. Capacity utilisation fell 0.2 points to 78.3 per cent.
The firming of production mostly reflected increases in the output of
durable consumer goods generally, which rose at an annual rate of 3 per
cent. Apart from motor vehicles, sectors sensitive to the cost of money  -
such as furniture, carpeting and home appliances - registered increases.
The industrial production index last month stood at 105.1 compared with 100
in 1987. It was 3.4 per cent below the level of a year ago and about 5 per
cent below the peak hit last September.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Hurd opposes wider role for EC on labour issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES IN the European Community that Britain might be softening its
opposition to EC labour market legislation were dashed yesterday.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, told other EC ministers in Brussels
that he was against proposals to extend majority voting - as opposed to
unanimous voting - to labour and social issues. Majority voting would
prevent Britain, or any member state, from vetoing parts of the social
policy programme and allow the EC a greater say in labour and social issues.
'It would be foolish to commit the community to policies in the social and
employment field which involve potentially enormous costs without regard to
growth,' Mr Hurd said.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, said: 'I feel like someone
who at the start of this century heard people say that the abolition of
child labour would cause the general collapse of the economy.'
The foreign secretary said Britain had dispelled the cloud of bad industrial
relations that had long hung over it. 'We do not want any pretext for
leading industry back into that situation,' he said.
The UK has been the only opponent of the EC Social Charter but it appeared
to come to terms with some of the legislation, such as written proof of
contracts.
On Monday, Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said in an interview
with the Financial Times that Britain now supported most elements of the
social char-ter.
Mr Delors countered Mr Hurd's complaint that social matters would be subject
to over-centralised regulation by saying that the commission was relying
heavily on dialogue between European employers and trade union
organisations.
Other EC ministers re-sponded angrily to Mr Hurd's remarks. Mr Gianni De
Michelis, the Italian foreign minister, warned that Britain could not hope
to get away with vetoing the whole EC political union on social policy
grounds alone.
Mr Mark Eyskens, Belgian foreign minister, suggested that the UK might be
left out of EC social policy-making.
It is unlikely such a compromise would be acceptable to other member states
which might complain that UK industry was escaping the costs of labour
regulation.
The Luxembourg presidency was proposing to extend majority voting to issues
of contractual conditions of employment and management consultation of
workers.
Majority votes now apply only to measures to improve workers' health and
safety, which generally have UK support. Under the Luxembourg plan,
unanimous voting would only be retained for social security issues.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK consumer credit growth at six-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH consumers have been holding back from new borrowing to finance
household goods and other durables although interest rates have fallen and
retail sales rose sharply in March.
The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that the amounts
outstanding on credit agreements with consumers increased by less in the
first quarter of this year than in any quarter since statistics were first
gathered in the mid-1980s.
The total amount borrowed from finance houses, building societies and on
bank credit cards to purchase consumer goods increased by Pounds 280m to
Pounds 30.03bn in the three months to the end of March. This was the lowest
quarterly increase in this 'narrow' measure of consumer credit business
since records began in 1985. It compares with a quarterly average rise of
Pounds 758m last year.
A broader measure of outstanding consumer credit, which also includes credit
granted in the form of loans by banks on personal accounts and by insurance
companies and retailers, rose by Pounds 840m to Pounds 51.47bn in the same
period. This compares with rises of Pounds 1.03bn and Pounds 1.26bn in the
two previous quarters and is the lowest figure since records began in 1987.
The announcement of the figures, which suggest that recessionary conditions
in the UK are continuing, coincided with the publication of slightly revised
retail sales figures for March, showing a strong volume increase of 3.6 per
cent over February.
The figures show a strong 12.9 per cent surge in the volume of household
goods sales in the month, confirming that the Budget increase in value added
tax to 17.5 per cent from 15 per cent had triggered the retail sales jump.
Household goods are frequently bought on credit but the monthly figures for
narrow credit business showed only a relatively modest increase of Pounds
122m in the amount outstanding in March after increases of Pounds 98m and
Pounds 60m in February and January respectively. Although the March credit
figure was in line with City expectations and had little impact in financial
markets, the difference between the strong growth in retail sales in March
and the subdued appetite of consumers for credit caused some puzzlement
among analysts.
Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the figures
probably pointed to a recent rise in real incomes as inflation fell.
Consumers had been able to accumulate surplus funds in their bank accounts
and were able to beat the Budget increase in VAT without increasing their
indebtedness, he said.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Bush pledge on chemical weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US will renounce the use of chemical weapons 'for any reason' and
destroy all its stockpiles within 10 years once international agreement is
reached banning their use, President George Bush said yesterday.
His announcement is intended to give fresh momentum to international talks
which resume today in Geneva on a chemical weapons convention.
The US move goes beyond a draft agreement signed at the US-Soviet summit in
Washington last June to destroy all but 5,000 tonnes each of their chemical
weapons stocks by 2002. In the first eight years after the signing of an
international agreement, this would be reduced to 500 tonnes. For the US,
this would have meant retaining about 2 per cent of its current total.
The White House has been considering the worldwide chemical weapons
initiative as part of a wider series of arms control moves specifically
affecting the Middle East.
In a statement intended to 'demonstrate the US commitment to banning
chemical weapons', Mr Bush said the US was 'formally forswearing the use of
chemical weapons for any reason, including retaliation, against any state,
effective when the convention enters into force and will propose that all
states follow suit'.
He added that the US 'unconditionally commits itself to the destruction of
all our stocks of chemical weapons within 10 years of entry into force of
the convention'.
Previously the US has retained the right to use chemical weapons in
retaliation - and to keep the 5,000-tonne stockpile - until all nations with
such weapons had agreed to eliminate them.
The US originally wished to keep a residual stockpile as a deterrent against
countries such as Iraq which might use chemical weapons in war but
Washington has changed its view, partly as a result of the Gulf war. The US
not only won through the use of conventional weapons but also had to
consider, and reject, the possible use of its own chemical weapons as a
retaliation against any Iraqi chemical attack - although none materialised.
Under the terms of the United Nations ceasefire resolution, Iraq is required
to hand over all its stocks of chemical weapons to a UN commission for
destruction.
At today's Geneva talks, the US is calling for the resolution of all
important issues by the end of this year and a final treaty within 12
months. The US delegation will ask that the negotiating committee of the
Conference on Disarmament stays in continuous session from now on.

FT  14 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Stock lending
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England has always encouraged the development of stock lending
in London, arguing that the activity brings valuable extra liquidity and
market confidence. In Thursday's Quarterly Bulletin, the Bank will provide
new evidence for its case. In gilts, for example, daily lending volume has
nearly trebled since Big Bang - to around Pounds 6bn. But the really
fast-growing market involves the lending of international securities, where
there is a problem. If London is to maintain its lead as a centre for the
trading of international securities and related lending and borrowing, a
solution must be found for the tax treatment of overseas lenders. The faster
the Inland Revenue agrees a fair mechanism, the better. Otherwise, London
will have shot itself in the foot - again.

FT  14 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market is inclined to think British Airways will hold its final dividend
next week - and the market is probably right. BA's balance sheet can stand
the strain; the Pounds 20m saved by halving the payout will be dwarfed by
trading losses in the final quarter; the wrath of shareholders is hardly
worth risking in the not unlikely event that cash flows prove insufficient
to meet the group's ambitious capital spending plans.
If the income question dominates the share price in the short term, though,
the issue thereafter is how far BA can recover from the twin traumas of
recession and the Gulf. The outlook at the moment is hazy, with forward
bookings pointing to a 10 to 15 per cent volume downturn year-on-year over
the crucial summer period. The bigger worry is the sharp drop in revenue
yields as the passenger mix shifts towards cheap-fare travellers. To add to
its woes, BA now faces a serious competitive threat on its transatlantic
routes, with the lower cost Virgin certain to put further pressure on
margins as the US carriers United and American go all out for market share.
BA has probably responded as well as any international airline to the
industry's crisis. In a post-Gulf world, however, the relentless growth of
business travel can no longer be taken for granted; and the regulators have
altered the rules.

FT  14 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: UK credit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile, it is likely that something more than hairs are being split in
policy discussions between Westminster and Threadneedle Street. The Bank
remains publicly concerned with metaphysical riddles, such as: When is a
crunch not a crunch? (some hours of the Treasury Committee's time went on
this not long ago); and: What is the underlying underlying rate of inflation
(answers on not less than 10 sides of paper). Ministers are increasingly
worried about votes.
The latest statistics suggest they are right to be anxious. The CBI small
firms survey confirms that there is indeed a credit crunch - if you are too
small to borrow outside the banking system. It is small companies who
complain that credit is sometimes difficult, and always too expensive (1 1/2
per cent a month from one clearer). The Bank of England calls that a fall in
credit demand; the victims call it a squeeze, and all too often a fatal one.
That is no way to treat pillars of their local Conservative Associations.
Yesterday's weak credit growth figures also look forbidding. The brief
beat-the-tax-increase retail boom was financed with astonishingly little
borrowing; at these real interest rates, credit demand is indeed price
sensitive. But officials should take care before they cite this as proof
that 'policies are working'. They are likely to be accused of what a former
chancellor called sado-monetarism. Politically switched-on dealers are
likely to pay less than their usual attention to market signals from the
Bank.

<TEXT>
Towards the bottom of the roller-coaster, the ride gets bumpy. If the UK is
indeed reaching the trough of the recession, yesterday's bumps are easy to
understand. The retailing and consumer credit figures, Wall Street, the
outlook for UK interest rates - all have a stomach-jolting feel about them.
More jolts ahead: the last two days of the week will bring grim economic
figures (because they are backward-looking) and the Monmouth by-election
result. The Fed, though, shows every sign of taking the US recession
seriously; if that leads to a further easing after today's meeting, Wall
Street's reaction could help London recover its poise, for a day or so at
least.

FT  14 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent places a BET on waste
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,486.6 (-37.7)
The problem with BET's Pounds 212m agreed sale of Biffa to Severn Trent is
its timing. BET not only has a chief executive so new he is unready to
elaborate a corporate strategy following the sale; it is also in purdah
ahead of its annual results, so the precise shape of its balance sheet can
only be guessed at.
The most one can say is that BET will now be in much better financial
health: it could scarcely be worse. Assuming net debt of Pounds 240m, its
gearing might be 40 per cent, against 86 per cent. Treating its AMPS
(auction market preferred stock) as debt, gearing has dropped to around 150
per cent.
BET has every reason to be satisfied with an exit multiple of 18, close to
what it always said the assets should fetch. With a guaranteed 9p final
dividend, its shares are already on a prospective yield of 6.7 per cent; add
in the interim payment and the yield is just under 10 per cent. This seems
about right until the group sets out its plans. Only a few weeks ago, after
all, the shares were yielding more than half as much again.
It is Severn Trent's shareholders who might have cause for concern, given
that the price is well above rumoured sighting shots of nearer Pounds 170m
and will probably mean dilution for a couple of years. The diversification
into waste management is sensible enough, but Severn's record is hardly
inspiring - remember Caird. The quality of Biffa's earnings is not so
self-evident that Severn can claim a definite success. Any revaluation of
Biffa's implied Pounds 85m of assets will make interesting reading. If it
finally does buy Caird later this year, Severn will have a national spread
in the management of waste. Shareholders must hope it does not become a
waste of management.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Green profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese delegation visited a new steelworks in the north of England. It
was losing money. The visitors made money using the same machinery in Japan.
Asked for advice, they came up with 57 nit-picking suggestions. For example,
the British opened their furnace doors to provide an 18-inch gap through
which to shoot finished rods; for the same process the Japanese opened their
doors only six inches. The saving on heat loss was measurable, and
contributed to the profits earned by the Japanese company.
This story was told by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, last
week. His lecture is one of the most effective pieces of sales talk for a
hard-headed environmental policy I have seen from any British minister - and
I do not forget Mrs Margaret Thatcher's stirring words about how all we have
of the earth is a life tenancy, with a full repairing lease. Mr Heseltine
does not preach green virtue. There is a paucity of phrases about saving the
planet. Instead there was a large dose of Heseltiniana ('what we need is . .
. a green renaissance of Britain's economy'), spiced with juicy vistas of
multibillions to be made from clean-ups and the production of greener goods.
'Where there's muck there's brass,' the secretary of state reminded his
audience, quoting an estimate that Pounds 850bn will be spent in the
European Community between now and 2000 on new capital equipment,
environmentally-friendly products and associated services. The British share
would be Pounds 140bn. In his characteristically self-effacing way he has
posted copies of the speech to 1,000 chief executives and asked them to join
a 'green club'.
It is customary to question Mr Heseltine's motives. I do not think that in
this address he was primarily concerned with chasing votes for the
Conservative party. His belief is that public concern for the environment
wanes during a recession, when unemployment and the like seem more pressing.
His speech, with its touches about Europe and partnership with industry,
contains an unspoken element of 'this is what you would have had if I had
been prime minister instead of John Major', but only enough to assuage a
modicum of vanity, nothing threatening or out of line. After all, he joined
forces with his ideological opposite - the industry secretary, Mr Peter
Lilley - to make Mr John Collins, Shell UK's chairman, head of a 23-member
advisory committee on business and the environment.
So let us take Mr Heseltine's words at face value. If they favour
regulation, or the setting of standards, they do so on the basis of the
argument that the country with the highest standards will be the one with
the German cars emit the waste-gas equivalent of Chanel No. 5
most competitive manufacturers. We all know, or should, the story of how the
Germans have made their cars exhaust the waste-gas equivalent of Chanel No.
5, with other car makers having to follow. Consumers, and regulators, demand
it.
This beady-eyed approach is to be found in a new book, Costing The Earth, by
Frances Cairncross, environment editor of The Economist newspaper. Ms
Cairncross provides a checklist of a dozen suggestions for company chairmen,
starting with 'put the most senior person possible in charge of
environmental policy'. Her arguments, which are those of a market economist,
seek at each point to attempt some measure of the costs as well as the
benefits of a particular green policy. Thus she says that it would make
sense for African governments to form an ivory cartel, rather than ban the
trade in tusks. That would eliminate middlemen, drive up prices - and ensure
that the elephant survives to earn future revenue. She refers to botanists
who develop non-timber products to demonstrate that rain forests standing
can be worth more than rain forests destroyed.
Among the many sources quoted is the Yale economist Professor William
Nordhaus, who apparently accepts that the benefits of banning
chlorofluorocarbons, responsible for the hole in the ozone layer may
outweigh the costs. But the goal of stabilising carbon dioxide output in
2000 at 1990 levels is alleged to be more costly to achieve than would be
the benefits of avoiding global warming. Ms Cairncross dutifully records
some of the green challenges to the Nordhaus equation, but implies that even
if his sums are wrong his methodology has to be addressed.
The question is, should it be? 'Ultimately, it is easier to think of
environmental issues in terms of ethics than of discount rates,' she writes.
'Most people feel comfortable with the idea that their descendants ought to
enjoy the same natural inheritance as they have themselves received.' She
manages, nevertheless, to fill 256 pages of recycled paper with merciless
analyses of every green proposition.
I would not, however, accuse her, or Mr Heseltine, of confusion. Just
because you are convinced of the imminence of catastrophe is no reason not
to do a few sums. Both the minister and the author accept the precautionary
principle - that in case the worst predictions are right it pays to do
something now. Both perceive that one practical response to the global
upsurge of green sentiment, which Ms Cairncross chronicles, is to use the
profit motive as the driving force for change. Freer than any minister, Ms
Cairncross can argue forcefully for higher energy prices, even taxes on
energy.
In short the agenda is no longer controlled by the goodly folk who first
brought it to our attention. It is part of everyday discourse, and subject
to its rigours. I believe that when the economy picks up, and perhaps
another discovery takes us a few notches higher up the curve of fear, the
costs of not protecting the future will loom larger, and professor
Nordhaus's flawed equations will have to be re-worked. Meanwhile, watch how
you open those furnace doors.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: Government cover for private export insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Price rightly points out (Letters, May 9) that some other EC
governments provide export credit insurance cover for the more risky
importing countries though they may do this indirectly through
private-sector companies. This is indeed the set-up which will apply in the
UK following the privatisation of the Insurance Services Group of the Export
Credits Guarantee Department. Mr Lilley - in the remarks to parliament to
which Mr Price refers (May 2) - was making the point that the proposed
changes to ECGD will bring it more into line with arrangements in other EC
countries.
As the minister for trade made clear at the report stage of the Export and
Investment Guarantees Bill, the government, after privatisation of Insurance
Services, will provide 100 per cent reinsurance through the continuing ECGD
for business on a handful of importing countries which are not at present
acceptable to the private reinsurance market. He stressed that the need for
this will be kept under review but, subject to satisfactory financial
performance within ECGD's trading account, it will continue for as long as
the government considered it essential to meet exporters' reasonable needs.
This support is likely to be a relatively minor ECGD facility, applying to
only about Pounds 300m a year of exports - not because of government
reluctance to provide a larger facility, but simply because of the
successful progress in negotiating arrangements with the private reinsurance
market which should ensure that the bulk of Insurance Services risks - both
commercial and political - will be placed in the private market upon
privatisation.
It is, perhaps, in this latter respect that future UK arrangements may
differ from those in some other EC countries. The government's aim has been
to privatise the business of Insurance Services. This would not be achieved
if a large element of that business continued to be reinsured by government,
particularly when it could be placed in the private market. The government
has, therefore, sought to maximise the scope of private market reinsurance
in a way that some other EC governments may not yet have done and which is
not damaging to UK exporters' interests.
It is a difference of degree, rather than principle. The government believes
that this approach is already being reflected in steps being taken in
virtually every other EC country to increase private sector involvement in
the provision of export credit insurance.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Leading Article: A compromise path to Emu
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE informal meeting of European Community finance ministers over the
weekend, plans for the EC's expedition to Economic and Monetary Union are
becoming clearer. Those plans may not be to everyone's liking; indeed, they
are probably to nobody's liking. Nevertheless, they represent a sensible
compromise.
Participants will not be allowed to prevent others from starting out towards
Emu, merely because they are unwilling to depart themselves; nor may they
insist on going in the vanguard, however unfit for that position they might
be; and even though countries may move at different speeds, each will do so
under supervision. The goal will not be reached much before the end of the
decade, while a European Central Bank is unlikely to be constructed before
its attainment. Finally, the move towards Emu may require a new budgetary
deal for the EC.
One point now seems clear. The British will have to change their plans
radically. This is not surprising, because they were absurd. The UK not
merely told the other 11 that it was unwilling to go where they wanted, but
intimated that the UK might veto the others' plans. Meanwhile, Britain
insisted that the others should not set out without it, because this would
leave it in the slower group within a 'two-speed' Europe. Further to enhance
the UK's reputation as a team player, it recommended that they should go
somewhere altogether different, towards the 'hard ecu'.
Poor chances
Since the UK's 'hard ecu' plan involves creating a new monetary institution,
which the Germans abhor, and does not introduce a single currency, which the
French (and others) desire, its political chances are close to zero. The
economic merits of the plan are greater than that, but this matters little.
The plan will have to be abandoned.
It was always inconceivable that the UK would veto a treaty on which the
others were determined, any more than it could prevent others from moving to
Emu. The best it could hope for was a degree of influence upon the pace and
nature of the move towards Emu, while not being forced into it itself.
The likely compromise cannot resolve all of the UK's political problems.
Acceptance of a treaty implies a commitment. Once it exists, the UK will
find itself confronted with a choice between participation, on the one hand,
and consignment to the slow group in a 'two-speed' Europe, on the other. The
treaty will certainly call for increased surveillance of economic policy. It
may imply greater fiscal transfers within the EC as well.
Shared interest
The need for parliament to ratify such a treaty is a recipe for trouble. But
since that trouble will arise within the two big parties as much as between
them, they share an interest in making as little as possible of one of the
most important decisions the country will ever take.
All this assumes that the other 11 can agree on the path to Emu. They can do
so, provided that they accept the terms of the one country that does have a
veto. The Germans will not accept the creation of a European Central Bank
before the new currency is introduced, are most unlikely to tolerate a
central bank not at least as independent as the Bundesbank and will not
consent to participation by countries that have not achieved a high degree
of convergence on the German standard.
These conditions are likely to be accepted (or at least appear to be
accepted). Difficulties would still remain. Convergence of inflation is
desirable, for example, but central control over the fiscal policies of
member states is not. How, then, will the EC deal with the problems created,
not by Greece and Portugal (which are economically insignificant), but by
Italy's huge public debt?
What the path to Emu will not involve is still clearer than what it will,
just as who will not be in the vanguard is more obvious than who will. For
all that, there is progress. The shape of the agreement is emerging. It is
one that will impose discomfort upon many - upon the UK above all, but not
only upon the UK.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Leading Article: A charter for consumers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister has set himself the task of completing work on his
citizens' charter this summer. If the charter is to form the centrepiece of
the Conservative election manifesto, he would be wise to review his holiday
plans - for while the aims are admirable, many important questions about the
charter's implementation need to be answered if sceptical consumers are to
be convinced of its merits.
The charter is designed to raise the quality of public services which cannot
immediately be privatised or exposed to competition through contracting out.
Budgetary controls can force service providers to make more efficient use of
limited resources, but there is often little that consumers can do to ensure
that their preferences are satisfied. The citizens' charter - more
appropriately a consumers' charter - would strengthen the consumer's voice
with two innovations to mimic the relationship between buyer and seller in
market transactions.
The first would create a contract between the service provider and the
consumer which specified the services to be provided. Thus BR might make the
commuter a range of promises on matters such as punctuality, cleanliness and
reliability of services. NHS patients could be guaranteed treatment within
time limits which depended on the seriousness of the complaint. Council
tenants would be entitled to repairs within a specified period.
Direct redress
This contract would be enforced by the consumer through the second
innovation: simple and direct channels of redress. So there might be rebates
or discounts when a train was repeatedly cancelled. More radically, a
consumer whose NHS operation was cancelled could be entitled to reasonable
reimbursement for the cost of private treatment (some local authorities
already reimburse tenants for the cost of repairs in such circumstances).
So far, so good, if a challenge to the imagination. But when it comes to the
details of how the charter would operate, substantive proposals are lacking.
For a start, which services will be covered? It is hard to see the charter
having much to say about education, unless it offers to pick up the fees for
Eton for parents let down by their local comprehensive. And what is to stop
managers re-organising services to avoid penalties, simply by sharing the
misery around more equally?
Then there are the cost implications of compensating dissatisfied customers.
Even if redress is only in the form of modest cash payments (as BT now
offers when it fails to keep home appointments), the cost is born by other
customers either in higher charges or worse service. The costs become much
more substantial if they empower the customer to claim back the cost of
private provision when the public service fails. For the NHS to make a
similar offer could lead to a rapid explosion of costs unless the service
targets were so modest as to be empty.
Consumers' interests
Consumer empowerment needs more than just redress systems. The evidence
suggests that only a small minority of consumers ever use such systems - and
those in most need are often least able to do so. The achievement of the
regulators who oversee the newly-privatised utilities suggests a model for
advancing the interests of consumers which could be extended to the public
services, although a public service regulator could not use his private
counterpart's most effective weapon - price restraint - in services which
are free at the point of consumption.
Questions such as these do not present insuperable problems, but finding
answers requires a willingness to confront hard issues. Some public services
are poor because they are badly managed: the citizens' charter could
certainly encourage improvements. Others are underfunded, and a charter
would only expose the low levels of service which have become the norm.
To improve many of Britain's public services requires a combination of
consumer power and extra investment. Charters alone will not guarantee the
improvement in public services which all parties now seem committed to
delivering in the 1990s.

The only certain way of determining the real worth of a company car to
employees - and despite Norman Lamont's best endeavours, they still seem to
be a sight more attractive than a 'go-anywhere' London Underground ticket -
is when the purring little perk is taken away from them.
According to advertising agency Foote Cone &amp; Belding, which has just
de-wheeled its staff, the answer is anywhere between Pounds 3,000 and Pounds
7,000 - the range of pay rises it has handed out by way of compensation.
Other companies seem likely to follow suit, notwithstanding threats from
Customs and Excise to levy VAT on those who, unlike some of their
colleagues, decline the cash option and keep the wheels.
FCB owned a fleet of 80 cars with a balance sheet worth of Pounds 1m and an
annual cost - in terms of servicing, insurance and depreciation  - of Pounds
500,000 and decided enough was enough.
Chris Whitworth, the agency's finance director, says that the costs of
providing the company car simply became prohibitive. He reckons many of
those whose cars were taken away have not even bothered to replace them.

One thing unlikely to change after the weekend elections in Nepal, land of
timeless beauty, is the time.
The Himalayan kingdom is thought to be the only country in the world which
lives in its own, 15-minute time warp. Since 1985, it has set its clocks
four hours and 45 minutes ahead of GMT - a quarter of an hour in advance of
neighbouring India.
Such demonstrations of independence carry great weight in a country trapped
between the giants of India and China. But some Nepalis insist the
difference is strictly scientific.
Time is determined by the longitude of the centre of a country, which in
India was set during the Raj at 82.5 degrees. That longitude goes nowhere
near Nepal, let alone cuts it in half, according to Gopal Sharma, chief
reporter at the country's government-owned newspaper, The Rising Nepal.
Religion, it seems, also plays a part in setting the clocks. The longitude,
which actually divides Nepal and provides the reference point for local
time, cuts through a mountain called Gauri Shanker named after the wife of
Lord Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and rebirth.
If the Congress party, the centrist group backed by India, emerges
victorious, there could be pressure to realign Nepalese time. But as Shiva
can bestow power upon those who please him, any sensible politician with an
ounce of ambition
may be best advised to leave well alone.

Let us not be beastly to the Germans, but are they really the dedicated,
horny-handed toilers they are made out to be? According to the German
Economic Institute, they seem increasingly ready to bunk off work and head
for the nearest beer hall.
The institute reckons those employed in industry should be clocking up an
average of just over 1,650 hours a year. But they are typically falling 145
hours short - for the most part, strange though it may seem, on Mondays and
Fridays.
By comparison the British, no longer the sick men and women of Europe, are
expected to put in more than 1,750 hours - and record a 'no show' for only
119 of same.
Both, however, look lazy alongside the Japanese who on average should be in
the factory for more than 2,200 hours each year, and bow out for a mere 36
hours.
The dedication of the Japanese could be something to do with the widespread
belief that while you can be sick, it must be in your own time and at your
own expense. The absence of the Germans, it appears, could be put down to
the generous compensation available and to competition among doctors to hang
on to patients by never knowingly refusing a sick note.

It is hardly surprising that by the time Sir Bernard Ingham left 10 Downing
Street, Maggie's craggy mouthpiece was not on good terms with Sir Geoffrey
Howe, who helped to jemmy the iron lady out of power. The surprising thing
is that relations between the two men did not suffer a good while earlier,
given an incident in 1981.
Oddly enough, it is not recalled in the much publicised memoirs in which
Ingham, bulky and indispensable like the great lady's handbag, has given a
compelling if not entirely unbiased account of his days and nights in Number
10. Puffed-up media lobby correspondents with mischievous motives, and
ministers who wilfully spoke out of turn come in for considerable stick.
What happened in 1981 was that Ingham himself quickly learned, at both his
and Sir Geoffrey's expense, about the danger of making unguarded, albeit
unattributable, remarks to the 'reptiles' - to borrow Denis Thatcher's
epithet - of the parliamentary lobby.
With Britain struggling to escape recession, Ingham found himself late at
night in a Copenhagen hotel room with assorted lobby reporters topping up
tumblers and bemoaning a boring EC summit meeting bogged down by quotas on
Japanese car and video-recorder imports.
Surely, they goaded the chief press secretary, Margaret Thatcher's free
market philosophy could not embrace artificial restraints on trading? Ingham
agreed, conceding that the only reason such measures were necessary at the
time was to protect a British economy in a 'bloody awful' state.
The tabloids sobered up and splashed their front pages with the quotation,
attributed to a 'top Thatcher aide'. As if that would not have been bad
enough in itself, Sir Geoffrey who was then chancellor had just stretched
the nation's credibility by pronouncing 'we have come to the end of the
recession'.
Howe was highly unamused; Ingham a little bit wiser.

yesterday in a protest against a proposed rent rise.
The threatened rent rise looked the last straw for the stores on one of
London's most fashionable shopping streets. Like other retailers, travel
companies and leisure groups that make up the consumer service sector, they
are struggling against the worst recession most of them have known.
Several companies have gone bust. The collapse of International Leisure
Group (ILG) and Lewis's department stores alone cost nearly 4,000 jobs.
Other companies can only hope that they can cling on until the autumn when
economists expect the outlook to be brighter.
Why has this sector, once seen as the key to Britain's economic resurgence,
suffered so severely in this recession? Are its difficulties purely a
product of short-term economic pressure, or are they related to longer-term
changes in consumer markets? And what will the sector look like after the
recession?
Consumer services were relatively resilient in the last recession of
1980-81. This was because real interest rates were comparatively low - in
that base rates were lower than inflation - and companies had been run
cautiously after the oil shocks of the mid-1970s. There was relatively
little expansion in leisure, entertainment and even in retailing. Video
shops, theme parks, superstores and multiplex cinemas were all in their
infancy in the early 1980s.
This recession is different. Real interest rates are high and the consumer
sector is far larger. The latest unemployment figures show that employment
in the service sector (which includes commercial as well as consumer
services) fell by 82,000 to 15.76m in the final quarter of 1990. Marks and
Spencer, which is today expected to disclose static profits, recently
announced 850 redundancies.
Moreover, many consumer service companies are burdened by high borrowings
after a decade of expansion. When interest rates rose and consumer spending
declined, companies such as ILG and Lewis's could no longer afford to pay
the interest on their debt. Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group which
owns William Hill betting shops and Brighton Marina, is still struggling to
restructure the Pounds 1.4bn debt amassed in its acquisitions of the 1980s.
Certain areas of consumer services have emerged unscathed. This is mainly
because some groups of consumers are better off thanks to high interest
rates, notably the over-50s, with low mortgages and high savings, and the
under-25s, who have few financial commitments.
The companies that service these particular customers are still faring well.
Blackpool Pleasure Beach is busy, partly thanks to its popularity with the
over-50s. The beach has invested heavily in new attractions for them, such
as the afternoon karaoke 'sing-alongs' in the Cabaret Rooms. So far this
season, despite rain and recession, attendance levels are 14 per cent higher
than last year.
The cinema is flourishing too, partly because of its appeal for the
under-25s. Cinemas enjoyed their best year for a decade in 1990 with average
weekly admissions of 1.88m people. So far this year, they have fared even
better with average admissions of 1.94m a week in the first quarter.
But pleasure beaches and cinemas are the exceptions. The worst-affected
companies are those catering for the 25 to 40-year-olds, the 'yuppies' of
the 1980s, many of whom bought property near the peak of the housing market
and are now saddled with hefty mortgage repayments and credit card debt.
The 'designer' shopping centres that opened in the 1980s, such as Tobacco
Dock in east London, are littered with boarded-up windows. Restaurants are
suffering too. Mr Alistair Little, who runs the eponymous restaurant in
London's Soho, first noticed the slowdown towards the end of last year. His
regulars have since been eating out less often and spending less on their
meals.
Companies linked to the housing market have also suffered. Home furniture,
one of the first areas to be affected, saw sales fall by 6 per cent in real
terms to Pounds 4.7bn last year. This was devastating for Lowndes Queensway,
one of the biggest furniture retailers which had just completed a Pounds
450m leveraged buy-out. Last summer, Lowndes called in the receiver.
In general, the recession has accentuated the difference between the
stronger and weaker players. In the pubs market, Mr Peter Jarvis, chief
executive of Whitbread, one of the biggest brewers, has noted the difference
between 'good pubs in large premises with decent facilities' which are still
doing well and the 'bad pubs in run-down areas' which are 'finding life very
difficult'.
When the end of the recession comes into sight later this year, the critical
question for the consumer service sector is what its long-term consequences
will be.
Some areas of consumer services are unlikely to return to their
pre-recession buoyancy. The designer shops and expensive restaurants in the
'yuppie' market would probably have contracted even without the economic
downturn. The self-indulgent young adults of the 1980s are now settling into
the responsibilities of family life as they enter their 30s.
Other areas will return to growth once the economy recovers. In furniture
retailing, where rationalisation has been severe - the number of stores has
fallen by 600 to about 14,000 in the past five years - there is sure to be
scope for re-investment.
The established companies, such as Magnet and MFI, are so burdened by debt
that new investors may move into the market. Argos, the catalogue retailer,
has been studying furniture retailing for several years and now plans to
open four stores. Ikea, the Swedish group which already owns three UK
furniture stores, plans to accelerate its expansion by opening up to 15
stores by the mid-1990s.
In other markets such as pubs, where rationalisation has been less intense,
the recession has tended to accelerate existing trends. The brewers have
speeded up the process of closing down their smaller, scruffier pubs in
favour of concentrating investment on more promising premises. Whitbread
shut 350 of its 6,650 pubs last year and spent Pounds 250m on new pubs and
restaurants such as Wayside Inns, its upmarket traditional country pubs.
But all consumer service companies face the challenge of getting to grips
with the long-term changes in the marketplace.
One important issue is the change in demographics: the decline in the number
of teenagers and the corresponding growth of the elderly population. This
poses obvious problems for businesses like fashion shops and theme parks
that depend on the teenage market.
Burton, which owns the Top Shop teenage fashion chain, is in the middle of a
strategic review of all its operations. Sears, which owns Miss Selfridge and
Dolcis, is reshuffling its retail portfolio. The focus of its investment is
now on 'family' concepts such as Adams children's wear shops and the Olympus
sports chain.
Alton Towers, the Staffordshire theme park owned by Pearson (which owns the
Financial Times), is concentrating its investment on enhancing its appeal to
families. In the past, it has relied on 'white knuckle' rides to attract the
thrill-seeking under-25s (who represented two-thirds of its 2m visitors last
year). It is now spending Pounds 6m on two new family rides - the Haunted
House and Runaway Mine Train - in the hope of attracting more family groups
to lessen the blow of the shrinking teenage market.
Demographic changes will also intensify the financial pressure on the
sector, notably on retailers and fast food chains, which have traditionally
depended on a regular influx of teenage employees on low wages.
These companies are already examining alternatives. McDonald's, the fast
food group, is developing a programme for part-time managers so some
employees, notably women with children, can return to work after career
breaks. It is also recruiting older managers who have spent most of their
careers in other industries.
The shortage of teenage recruits will almost certainly force companies to
offer higher pay, thereby increasing overheads at a time when they already
face rising property costs due to rent and rate reviews, like those on South
Molton Street.
Demographic and financial pressures aside, the chief challenge for the
service sector is to respond to the continuing demand from consumers for
higher quality in terms of products and service. This was one of the main
trends of the 1980s and has continued, despite the recession, as the pattern
of trading in pubs suggests.
In some markets, the drive towards higher quality means the successful
companies will be those that continually invest in improving their products.
The brewers will carry on upgrading their pubs. A recent study by the
Brewer's Society suggested that as many as 8,000 of Britain's 80,000 pubs
will close over the next decade so the brewers can concentrate resources on
their larger, more modern pubs.
Similarly, food retailers will continue the process of closing their old
supermarkets to concentrate investment on new superstores, the giant stores
selling everything from avocados to ankle socks.
M and S, which already runs eight edge-of-town clothing and food stores,
plans to open up to 25 over the next few years. Tesco has identified 200
prospective sites, many of which will be superstores. However, Sir Ian
MacLaurin, Tesco's chairman, said it also plans to stay in the high street
by developing 'high-quality neighbourhood stores'.
In other markets, the quality trend could create opportunities for
expansion. These will be the less 'mature' markets, such as restaurants and
hotels, that have been constrained by the comparatively unsophisticated
taste of British consumers. The British undoubtedly became more cosmopolitan
during the 1980s but most Britons have never tasted pizza and still stay at
home for their holidays.
This means that companies like Forte, the hotel group, can expect to expand
by 'converting' new consumers, in its case the people who do not usually
stay in hotels. One of Forte's most successful concepts is the five year-old
Travelodge budget chain.
Travelodge, which offers a standard package of a double room for the fixed
price of Pounds 29.95, is designed for the leisure travellers who cannot
afford luxury hotels but are wary of the poor facilities in bed and
breakfasts. There are now 81 Travelodges. Forte plans to open 40 a year at
least until 1995.
Forte may be right and the British will have become converts to hotel
holidays - and pizza eating - by the end of the 1990s. But in the meantime,
Forte, South Molton Street and the rest of the consumer service sector face
at least another six months of financial pressure as they wait for the end
of the recession.

<TEXT>
'My subject is War, and the pit of War' wrote Wilfred Owen in 1918, just
before he was killed. David Smith's 'Medals for Dishonor' are about anger,
as well as pity, anger against warmongers and the exploiters of the
defenceless. Smith is best known in this country as a welder of large
abstract sculptures in stainless steel. The Tate Gallery owns a fine 'Cubi'
of 1964, now augmented, thanks to a generous loan by his daughters of two
earlier, more figurative sculptures. Again, thanks to the family, we can now
see the extraordinary series of fifteen bronze reliefs which he made between
1937 and 1940 at the Imperial War Museum, brilliantly displayed in glass
cabinets.
Unlike his contemporary American abstract expressionists, Smith travelled
widely in Europe in 1935-36, ending up in Britain. He was a violent opponent
of rising Fascism in Germany and Italy, and his awareness of the Spanish
Civil War was strengthened by seeing Picasso's 'Guernica' when it was
exhibited in New York. The specific impetus for the Medals was a visit to
the British Museum in May, 1936, where he saw a display of First World War
medals by German and French artists. He was especially drawn to the savage
propaganda of the German medals, which he related to the disintegrating
political situation in America.
Smith's targets were politicians, diplomats, the press (in particular,
William Randolph Hearst), the clergy and what he called 'War Exempt Sons of
the Rich,' whose medallion has a Greek inscription translating as 'soft
cookies' across the centre. The imagery is strongly influenced by European
Surrealism, especially Dali, and he borrows Picasso's symbolic use of the
bull to represent the 'disemboweller of the lie of Franco.' Smith also
quotes from Goya's 'Disasters of War' and draws on the apocalyptic language
of paintings by Bosch and Breughel. The medallions were made with extreme
difficulty, using dentists' and jewellers' tools on hard dental stone.
Smith's anger seems quite literally to bubble through the surface. The first
(and only, as it turned out) edition was cast in bronze and exhibited in
1940 to a distinct lack of acclaim. Since none was sold, they have remained
in the family and are now exhibited with related drawings. Taken together,
the ferocious anti-war and anti-corruption statements which they make are as
relevant today as they were then. (Until June 23).
*****
Denis Masi is also concerned with the machinery of conflict, with man's
never-ending desire for territorial expansion at the expense of the weak,
with paraphernalia of domination which includes imprisonment and
surveillance. Masi's concepts are based on issues and polemics, which until
recently have been more appropriately displayed as installations in public
places. With the new wall work, Masi has come off the street and into two
galleries, Edward Totah and Anderson O'Day. Although he has moved away from
installations, the work has lost none of its impact. Elegant and beautifully
crafted, Masi's wall pieces lie in wait, crouched by sleek feline creatures,
waiting to pounce on the imagination.
The smoothly finished weld mesh and copper cladding of 'Border No. 3' does
not conceal that it is about territory, both physical and psychological,
whether it be Northern Ireland, Kuwait or Kurdistan. The searchlight,
described as a found object, in 'Make It Known,' speaks volumes to the
collective memory of watchtowers at Buchenwald or Long Kesh. Many of the
pieces include a mirror, which gives the viewer back his own image and,
inserted into oxydised copper, as a narrow, horizontal strip behind a weld
mesh cage, must also be understood as an observation device. Either way, the
viewer is drawn into complicity with the artist. 'Territorial Imperative,'
incorporates corrugated steel, a flue and louvers. Uneasily, we wonder
whether we are in a mortuary or a hospital, the flue perhaps an escape route
for smoke from a crematorium. (Until May 25.)
Far removed from politics and the sturm und drang of warring nations are
Lucy Jones's rapturous paintings of her native city at the Flowers East
gallery. Born and bred in London, she celebrates its buildings and monuments
in dazzling colours. Not since Derain, in imitation of Monet, was sent here
by his dealer in 1905 has London been recorded with such panache. Like Monet
and Derain, Jones is magnetised by the river. Drawn to it repeatedly, she
paints it in a variety of moods and colours; the dolphins on the lamp-posts
along the embankment take on a vigorous life of their own, here green and
red, there purple and brown.
Buses and cars lollop round Trafalgar Square like Dinky toys or hurtle
towards Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Jones's rainbow-hued London is
the city of her mind, bearing little relation to the archetypal grey, wet
Saturday afternoon. Her self-portraits are a new avenue down which she has
raced full tilt, revelling in the permutations of colour contrast: Van Gogh
sunflower yellow is the background for the violet-clad artist in the
full-length portrait, 'All of Lucy Jones.' (To May 26.)
*****
Laura Ford's paintings and sculptures at Benjamin Rhodes Gallery have a
superficial look of innocence, which proves to be entirely false. Little
girls, dressed in neat embroidered pinafores, stand atop full mountains of
foam cushions. Their childish appearance is subverted by a menacing pair of
pistols, whilst in place of a head there is a tangled mass of Gorgon locks
or a bursting flower. Surrealism is disturbingly mixed up with nursery rhyme
illustration, more Struwelpeter than Kate Greenaway. Far from being a Teddy
Bears' Picnic, the painting 'Shagpile' looks more like a gang-bang or ritual
slaughter. Ford's declared liking for the sinister cautionary tales of
Patricia Highsmith is made visible in her frightening and unpleasant
subtext. (To June 8.)

FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: Same Old Moon - Globe Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After having seen the first part of Same Old Moon at the re-opening of the
Oxford Playhouse last month, one went to its arrival in London with the
heart somewhere between the knees and the boots. Yet it is amazing what hard
work and a better stage can bring. This is not another Dancing at Lughnasa,
and not only because Geraldine Aron does not write as well as Brian Friel -
it would be hard to do that. Ms Aron's piece also lacks the imagination and
the ability to create a world on its own that are so conspicuous in Dancing.
But, seen at the Globe, it is not a bad play.
The Oxford theatre is cramped and box-like, perhaps fatally so. The Globe
has space enough to illustrate the title. The moon shines on Dublin, Galway,
London and such faraway places as Rhodesia (as Zimbabwe then was) and
Australia. The question is whether it is always the same moon. One answer is
given by the Irish barman who turns on the wireless and hears of the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. 'Always the same old news,' he says in
disgust as he turns it off. In other words, it depends on the way you look
at it.
Brenda, now beautifully played by Gabrielle Reidy with a confidence that the
same actress did not have in Oxford, is catholic, Irish, and wants to get
away and write. She has a father who appears to dislike her. Almost on his
deathbed he confesses it is because they are too similar. He admires her,
however, because unlike him she does not think that it is always the same
old moon. She goes off and does things.
The play has some strong vignettes. A nun demonstrates to Brenda the act of
procreation with a phallus-shaped biscuit and a doughnut. Brenda exchanges
one of her first kisses in return for a ride on a bicycle: it is the bicycle
that gets bent and broken. Best of all is the letter from the Vatican in
response to Brenda's appeal to the Pope. It is signed by Monsignor Flaherty
who adds in brackets 'formerly Martin Flaherty' of a road in Galway.
There are also some cliches: too many attempted jokes about sex and
catholicism. It is not particularly funny that Brenda's father (played by
James Ellis and looking curiously like Sir Bernard Ingham) should adopt all
the prejudices of an Alf Garnett when he arrives in London, complaining
about Pakistanis running the hospital and Jews running the country. A
longish sequence which is devoted to what happens to women when they start
wearing a dressing gown must have been played at least a dozen times before,
though I suppose it has a twist at the end: it is the fear of the same old
dressing gown that spurs Brenda on again.
For my taste it is too Irish, sentimental and maudlin, but others may well
like it and Jenny Killick's direction has improved beyond measure since
Oxford.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: The Black Rider - Berlin Theatre Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To kill your wife in a shooting accident is one thing; to turn the episode
into a musical would seem, gall aside, to invite theatrical fiasco in the
worst of taste. Add lyrics that slide between German and English, a set that
crosses von Sternberg with a western, rock music with fairground honky-tonk,
and disaster looks assured.
So it is with reluctant but moonstruck admiration that I report The Black
Rider (text: William Burroughs) as the star of the Berlin Theatre Festival
(to May 20) and one of the most delightful, inventive, profound and
originally musical musicals composed; a fitting - self-consciously so -
successor to those other mythical English-German concoctions, The Threepenny
Opera and Cabaret.
The Black Rider overlays the modern legend of Burroughs, the Beatnik junkie
who shot his wife, with the old tale of the village clerk who has to pass
muster as marksman before he can marry the gamekeeper's daughter. He makes a
pact in 'silver bullets' with the devil but on his wedding day Satan betrays
him and he shoots dead not the targetted white dove but his wife. This was
the story, converted to a happy ending, of Weber's Der Freischutz. Now
Burroughs, the Texan director and stage designer Robert Wilson, and rock
composer Tom Waits, have reworked the original into a contemporary version.
Other myths get woven in. Wilson's devil is a sleek Master of ceremonies in
whiplash tails who croons the Cabaret welcome 'So come on in/it ain't no
sin/take off your skin/and dance around in your bones'. He introduces the
cast, his 'devil's band', as they step one by one out of a black felt
sentry-box.
For three hours of graceful, cold artifice, they look, act and sound like
figures from the silent movies: movements abrupt, irregular, too fast, too
slow, as if wound up by a shaky hand projector; chalk-white, bony faces,
blackened eye sockets, lips thickened into permanent red pouts. Every image
is ice-hard: hair pulled back crisp or standing up in spikes, clothes
exaggerating bodies with jagged collars, razor pleats, square and
rectangular dresses.
The set continues the theme; Wilson turns children's drawings into
three-dimensional monstrosities. Crooked chairs, two metres high, dangle at
odd angles along with a huge frame whose broken glass juts into the flesh of
its 'living' picture, the gamekeeper's ancestor (Heinz Fossbrink). Pine
trees are scissor cut-outs which collapse and grow again like cartoons,
illuminated sugar pink and lime green against a black forest. Large or small
scale, Wilson is a master of spectacle: the clerk William and his Katchen
floating above the stage for a duet as the great neon sign of a gun descends
before them; the white stockinged leg in red stiletto that appears out of a
slit in the black sentrybox, image of naivety, severity, brittle romance.
Best of all, the whole, the sustained dramatic unity of the vision, is
greater than the sum of its parts. Tom Waits' sarcastic ballads, full of
folk and blues and rock, call back the scarred idealism and mock simplicity
of Kurt Weill, while Burroughs' monosyllabic banality has here found the
setting which makes it seem perfect.
Nursery rhyme humour marries English with German, while Hollywood kitsch
rolls into Teutonic romanticism. Wilson's cast bop and strut and beat out
the mesmeric rhythms in husky tempting voices. The devil (Dominique Horwitz)
has the best tunes, and mocks us for loving them. In 'Last Rose of Summer'
he picks a flower from the floor, affects a tear, disappears into his box
and, inside it, hovers up to the roof of the stage.
Annette Paulmann and Stefan Kurt, as Katchen and William, screech like
vultures and sing like angels. She plays an imaginary piano and draws
patterns in the air as she sings the breathless lyric 'I'll shoot the moon
right out of the sky for you, baby'; he dances a ballet of despair, shock
and loss breaking through his wax face, before rallying with 'I'll be back
on some lucky day'. This production returns to Hamburg's Thalia Theatre
after Berlin, with a stop in Amsterdam on May 14-16. So far plans for a
London visit have not materialised, but this is a show worth a plane ticket.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Technology: The icon gathers a loyal following - As
Microsoft's Windows 3.0 approaches its first birthday, Della Bradshaw
reflects on the software program that took the computer world by storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until a year ago, London-based chartered accountants Touche Ross had just
two choices when it wanted to computerise the process of auditing its 1,500
clients.
First Touche could write its own software from scratch - or employ a
contractor to do it - which could prove costly and time-consuming.
Alternatively, Touche could buy a standard software package and try to
adjust the way the firm operated in order to make the auditors' practices
fit the format of the software.
Neither option proved attractive: there was a dearth of readily available
audit support software and the firm was cautious about embarking on a big
software applications drive. Because the bulk of audits are carried out
between November and April - for companies which report their year-ends in
December or March - Touche had to be sure that the software could be
implemented in the slack summer period.
'If we missed that window we were another year away,' relates Mark Stephens,
partner for information technology at Touche. 'Something that took 13 months
to develop was really a two-year programme for us.'
Advised of its imminent arrival, Stephens decided instead to wait for the
Windows 3.0 software program, launched a year ago this month by Microsoft,
the leading US personal computer software company.
The initial success of Windows 3.0 - nearly 3m copies of the program have
been sold worldwide - has been generated because it radically alters how
IBM-compatible personal computers can be used, giving them the look and feel
of an Apple Macintosh.
But more sophisticated users of Windows 3.0, such as Touche, believe its
long-term popularity will be rooted in the ability it gives software
developers to customise their own packages more quickly. 'It takes a third
to a quarter of the time to produce sophisticated software than before,'
says Stephens.
Windows 3.0 is a 'graphical user interface', a program that generates menu
bars, icons and overlapping windows, which can be used with various
applications programs such as word processing or spreadsheets. The interface
enables users to point at symbols and click an electronic 'mouse' to select
functions, instead of typing commands on a keyboard.
What makes Windows 3.0 useful to software developers is that it provides a
'programming environment' which sits on top of the applications package and
enables the procedures within the standard package to be adapted to the
needs of the user organisation. Certain procedures can be ordered in a
different way or eliminated if they are irrelevant.
'In the past we developed word processing packages on the basis of what we
thought users wanted, but you couldn't change them to fit in with the work
pattern that you had in the office,' says David Smith, systems marketing
manager for Microsoft. 'In trying to be general, and develop a package for
every single user in the world, you had to compromise along the way.'
Stephens and his team decided to use Microsoft's Word word-processing
package running under Windows 3.0 as the basis for their development
programme. 'Auditing is a lot about writing but I didn't want to develop a
new word processor. However we couldn't use a standard word processing
package - we needed to tailor it to our specific application,' recalls
Stephens.
So they adapted the Word software, using Windows, to make it look like an
auditing tool. 'From an underlying software standpoint about 95 per cent of
the software is Microsoft. We've done about 5 per cent,' says Stephens. But
he reports that from a user point of view about 80 per cent of software
appears to be a specifically designed for auditing.
The Touche software developers have achieved this by taking all the
word-processing features available in the Word package and linking them
differently. On top of that they have created headings and formats
specifically for their auditors' needs. The progression on standard forms
and layout, for example, mirrors the procedures an auditor would follow in
the course of his job - whether auditing banks or grocery stores.
Although the first software package, launched on 600 machines in August
1990, concentrated on the presentation of the software, this summer
Stephens's department will be adding to the basic features and contributing
to the content of the application. One thing the development team will be
looking at is making the existing software easy to translate - Touche's
Paris office has already shown an interest in going down the same
development route.
Because the development cycles are so short, Touche has even been able to
create several prototype applications and, once appropriate software has
been selected, the rest have been thrown away.
Stephens points out that in spite of the moves towards these programmable
applications packages, the basic applications tools are not completely
ready. Of the five common applications that can be used by most
organisations - word processing, spreadsheet, database, communications and
graphics - Microsoft has developed only two to run under Windows 3.0 -
Excel, the spreadsheet package, and Word. It has also adapted Project, for
project management.
But the success of Windows has persuaded all the large applications software
houses to adapt their most popular packages which run under Dos - the widely
used PC operating system - so that they can take full advantage of Windows.
Lotus, for example, is in the final stages of developing a version of its
popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet package which will fully exploit Windows 3.0, and
is planning to have business graphics for the operating program later this
year, says Robert Ingram, spreadsheet sales and marketing manager for the
company. Borland International has three programming tools which work with
Windows 3.0, and is also adapting its Paradox relational database package
and its Quattro Pro spreadsheet program.
Microsoft estimates that there are now more than 700 software developers
writing new Windows-based applications, all hoping to take a bite of an
ever-growing cherry. The Software Publishers Association in the US estimates
that worldwide sales of Windows 3.0 applications are now second only to
those of Dos applications packages. Market research consultant Dataquest
underlines this optimism: it estimates that by 1992 systems sales of Windows
will have overtaken those of Dos.
The growth in the number of packages to run with Windows 3.0 has changed the
buying patterns of Windows users, says Smith. 'For the first six or seven
months there was an enormous growth in the sales of Windows operating
software. But for the last five months we have seen applications sales shoot
up - sales have quadrupled. Now 85 per cent of Windows users have a Windows
application,' he says.
Initially Windows 3.0 customers were running their existing Dos programs
with the operating system - giving them the advantage of the icon-type
presentation but without the power to move in and out of the applications
provided by Windows 3.0. With Dos programs the user is forced to follow a
series of commands in order to move through the program - like boring a
hole, which you have to climb back out of before you can begin boring
another hole.
The Windows icons enable users to jump between different applications. So
one advantage of combining a Windows application with the Windows 3.0
program, says Smith, is that the user can take text, graphics or numbers
from one applications package and transfer them into another - figures from
a spreadsheet program can be copied into a report being prepared in a word
processing package, say.
Perhaps the biggest advantage is that the two application packages need not
even be provided by the same software companies.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Delors overture fails to unite
Conservatives - European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission suggestions for compromise on economic and monetary
union showed little sign yesterday of uniting the Conservatives on Europe -
or of tapping undiscovered goodwill among Tory MPs to Mr Jacques Delors, the
commission's president.
Suggestions at the weekend that Britain be allowed to sign a treaty without
agreeing on the final goals did nothing to alter the well-rehearsed
convictions of Tories at Westminster.
The anti-federalists, with the Bruges Group in the vanguard, remained
opposed to any deal by which Britain would accept, even tacitly, a single
currency. The most 'pro-Europe' Tories were anxious for Britain to react
positively.
Those in the middle remained sceptical of Mr Delors' vision for Europe and
anxious to avoid being 'bounced' into a treaty the UK might regret. Not even
an opportunity to defer awkward decisions beyond the election swayed
firmly-entrenched views. Words of encouragement were qualified by warnings
that the small print had to be examined carefully.
The government's reaction was also cautious. If a decision was to be
deferred for a future parliament, all options had to be kept open. The 'hard
Ecu' remained on the table. But officials admitted the European Commission
had at least show 'an appreciation of the UK's concerns'.
For some MPs who strongly opposed a single European currency, Mr Delors'
suggestion was acceptable only if it was clear Britain was defering the
decision on whether to accept such a move - not just the timing. And there
was no deadline for a decision.
One right-wing minister said: 'If we can dither indefinitely, it's fine. If
there is a cut-off point to the dithering, it's a fraud,'
Mr Patrick Robertson, secretary of the Bruges Group, said: 'Any compromise
which makes Britain accept a single European currency in principle would be
completely unacceptable. At present there is not enough information anywhere
to be clear exactly what the form of words would be.'
Mr Teddy Taylor, secretary of the European Reform Group, went as far as
saying: 'If the government could negotiate an arrangement 'without
commitment' we feel that this would be a very major advance in the battle to
preserve our freedom and to safeguard the nation against socialist control
and bureaucracy.'
But Mr William Cash, the prominent anti-Federal Europe MP for Stafford, said
it was 'unrealistic' to expect what amounted to a two-tier Europe to work in
practice.
Among the middle ground of the party, there was anxiety, to be seen as
pro-European, like Mr John Major. But there was suspicion about Mr Delors'
blueprint for Emu. Mr Terence Higgins, chairman of the Commons' Treasury
select committee, said Mr Delors, 'thinks he is losing the argument' and so
was trying to get British agreement for allowing other EC members to proceed
on a pre-determined timetable.
For most on the pro-European wing, however, the plan was another opportunity
the UK appeared set to rebuff. Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East, said: 'How
crazy it is that even when the commission president proposes a helpful
compromise, meeting specific British hesitations, it is denounced by a small
number of hysterical anti-marketeers.'

FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Ingham as teaching aid rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUGGESTION that all new civil servants should be issued with a copy of Sir
Bernard Ingham's memoirs to learn how to 'stitch up elected ministers at the
request of the prime minister' was greeted with derision yesterday by Mr Tim
Renton, the Civil Service minister.
Mr Tony Banks, (Lab, Newham NW), had said Kill the Messenger, Sir Bernard's
account of 11 years as Mrs Margaret Thatcher's press secretary, would make
an effective teaching aid at the Civil Service College.
Earlier Mr Renton rejected a call by Mr Max Madden (Lab Bradford West) for a
new inquiry into the Westland affair.
In his book Sir Bernard denies that he authorised a leak from the department
of trade and industry of a letter from Sir Patrick Mayhew, the then
Solicitor General, referring to Mr Michael Heseltine's conduct throughout
the affair.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Politicians play fast and loose
with the numbers / Testing the validity of arguments in the current debate
on taxes and public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN politicians begin to argue about the relative merits of lower taxes or
higher public spending it is time for the voters to beware. When the debate
takes place in the approach to a general election and becomes enmeshed in
the detail of supposedly incontrovertible arithmetic the most sensible
course for the uncommitted is to suspend belief.
The real political - and economic - arguments behind the relative stances of
the Tories and Labour party in the past week have been drowned in a sea of
irreconcilable and often spurious statistics.
At one level there is no fundamental disagreement between the parties that
if the economy grows and tax rates remain constant, the government will reap
a 'growth dividend'. It can spend it in one of three ways, or in any
combination of the three: to reduce borrowing, to increase spending, and to
reduce tax rates.
The Conservative policy is based on delivering a combination of all three.
It says it will continue to provide real increases in resources for the
public sector, will move towards a balanced budget, and will find room to
cut the basic rate of income tax.
Labour has said it will use the dividend to boost spending and it will
definitely not cut tax rates. It has been silent on whether it would reduce
borrowing or keep it at present levels.
Its only costed spending commitments - to increase child benefit and raise
state pensions - will be financed separately by abolishing the ceiling on
employees National Insurance Contributions and by increasing the top rate of
income tax to 50p from 40p.
But if that sounds a relatively straightforward choice as between Labour and
the Conservatives, a dispassionate observer of the claims and counterclaims
flung across the party divide in recent days could draw only one conclusion:
our political masters canp. There have been many examples, but one or two
give some of the flavour.
In the middle of last week Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, declared that
on the basis of growth of 2.5 per cent a year his party could expect a
'dividend' of about Pounds 20bn to devote to public services over the
lifetime of a parliament. The Conservatives seized on the figure as a
'gaff'. Their own spending plans already included provision for an extra
Pounds 26bn in the next three years. If Labour was to spend Pounds 20bn more
it would have to raise taxes.
It was a credible, if contentious point but the Conservatives then spoilt
the case with their own arithmetic.
Their charge was that Labour would have to raise the basic rate of income
tax by 2p each and every year for the lifetime of a parliament, pushing the
basic rate of income tax to 35p. They omitted to mention that this would
raise not Pounds 20bn but Pounds 60bn. The message yesterday was that Mr
John Major, who first used the 10p figure, had made the 'reasonable'
assumption that Mr Kinnock had been talking about Pounds 20bn a year in
extra spending by the end of a parliament.
Labour meanwhile has been busy making its own assumptions about the
Conservatives' plans. The strategy behind its weekend charge that Mr Major
had a hidden agenda to raise Value Added Tax from 17.5 per cent to 22 per
cent in order to finance cuts in the basic rate of income tax was clear.
The government has raised VAT twice since 1979 to finance reductions in
income tax and, more recently, to reduce poll tax bills. Since its own
figures showed there was no room in the next three years to reduce the basic
rate of income tax, Labour felt able to claim that it was obvious VAT would
rise again.
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, was careful, however, not to mention
any of the caveats with which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has
circumscribed the income tax commitment. A rise in VAT of 4.5 per cent would
raise Pounds 8bn a year, enough to cut 4p off the basic rate of tax in the
first budget of a new Conservative government.
Mr Lamont has stressed, however, that he plans to move towards his target at
an altogether more sedate pace.
Even if the politicians did not misinterpret their opponents' intentions,
the apparent precision of their figures bestows a spurious accuracy on
economic forecasts stretching five years ahead. The Treasury has shown in
the past few years that it is dangerous to trust predictions stretching just
12 months ahead.
The debate of the last few days does tell the voter that taxes are likely to
be lower under the Conservatives and public spending higher under Labour.
Beyond that the forecasts are perhaps best regarded with the same confidence
as the average horoscope.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Plea for white collar jobless -
Unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS speculation about the date of the general election continued in the
Commons last night Sir Robert McCrindle, a senior Conservative backbencher,
called on the government to pay closer attention to the growth in 'white
collar' unemployment.
He stressed that it was a 'phenomenon' of the current recession which was
affecting voters in his Brentwood and Ongar constituency and others within
commuting distance who looked to the City of London for employment .
Labour MPs predicted that their party was poised to win the Monmouth
by-election on Thursday and that, as a result, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, would avoid calling a general election before October at the
earliest.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, declined to comment on the timing
of the general election but reaffirmed the government's determination to
make Labour's spending commitments - and the implications for increased
taxation - a key feature of the campaign.
Sir Robert McCrindle accepted that priority had to be accorded to getting
inflation down but urged the government to spread the coverage of its
advertising campaign on unemployment to cover the services sector as well as
manufacturing industry.
While the 1980s had been characterised as the period of the 'yuppies' and,
perhaps, 'the unacceptable face of the City of London' the latest downturn
in the economy had changed the situation.
Sir Robert estimated that about 40 per cent of the current rise in
unemployment, and about half the company liquidations, were in the 'services
dominated' south east of England.
MPs approved a motion authoring the House to adjourn from May 23 to June 3
for the spring recess.

THE Ministry of Defence is organising a 'major audit effort' to prevent
fraud in the shipping of military equipment back from the Gulf, the Commons
Public Accounts Committee was told yesterday.
Sir Michael Quinlan, permanent under-secretary at the Ministry, said the aim
was to ensure it was returned 'in a properly accounted manner'.
His assurance followed a five-fold rise to Pounds 1.2m. in the amount
involved in alleged fraud at defence establishments in the last financial
year, compared with a total of just over Pounds 2m in the previous six
years.
He admitted he was surprised at the low proportion of people who were
dismissed or resigned as a result.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Unions seek advice on R-R jobs move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS were yest-erday seeking legal advice over a decision by
Rolls-Royce to terminate the contracts of its 34,000 aerospace workers in
order to implement a pay freeze.
The move - claimed by some unions to be mass sackings, if only on a
temporary basis - is one of the most significant attempts by a company to
change its employees' contracts during the recession.
Rolls-Royce said the move was nothing more than a legal technicality, and
that employees would be offered contracts on broadly similar terms. It added
that it had no wish to see people dismiss themselves as a result of its
decision.
Mr Tim Webb, national officer of the MSF general technical union, said the
company had 'imposed a six-month wage freeze without consultation or
warning'.
Rolls-Royce announced the pay freeze last week at the same time as unveiling
plans to double job losses in the aerospace division this year to 6,000.
In a subsequent letter to employees, sent at the end of last week, the
company gave notice that contracts would be terminated at various stages,
depending on length of service, from last Saturday. New conditions would be
exactly the same as existing ones except that pay would be frozen.
Mr Webb said unions were worried the company was planning other changes to
working practices, including the introduction of individual contracts.
Few other companies among the increasing numbers of employers announcing pay
freezes have terminated existing contracts. However, Mr D'Arcy Payne,
personnel director in Rolls-Royce's aerospace division, said that the
company had taken careful legal advice before making its decision.
Under the pay freeze, increments to reward length of service will be
suspended. In addition, there will be no general pay rises for at least six
months.
Leaders of the manual workers' union will meet on Thursday to discuss the
job losses and the pay freeze, and union officials are also asking for a
meeting with the Rolls-Royce board.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Post Office staff vote for strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTER and clerical staff employed by the Post Office have voted to strike
over a 6.8 per cent pay offer. The Union of Communication Workers, the main
Post Office union, last night called for the urgent resumption of talks in
an attempt to have the offer increased.
The ballot result was announced yesterday at the UCW's conference in
Blackpool. Mr Alan Tuffin, UCW general secretary, agreed last night that the
result was some way from the overwhelming majority that union negotiators
had sought.
In a 67 per cent turnout for the ballot, 4,613 UCW members voted for
industrial action, while 3,732 voted against.
A total of 14,500 counter and clerical staff are employed by the Post Office
Counters business, which is separate from mail sorting and delivery service.
Mr Tuffin said that he would have liked more members to have taken part in
the ballot. However, the result, which had come from what was traditionally
a non-militant section of the union, indicated the strength of feeling among
the membership.
A number of options for action remained open, said Mr Tuffin. Workers in
cities such as London, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester were likely to have
voted most heavily for a strike, and it was possible there could be
selective action. He added that Post Office Counters management had been
asked to travel to Blackpool, where the union's conference continues for the
rest of the week, so that talks could re-open without delay.
Post Office Counters said last night that it was clear the union's executive
did not have an overwhelming mandate for strike action and it hoped that the
pay offer would now be quickly agreed.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Harrods to be asked to abandon pay
freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USDAW, the shop workers union, will this week attempt to persuade Harrods,
the London department store, to lift a six-month pay freeze for its 4,000
employees.
The Knightsbridge store, which has been encountering difficult trading
conditions because of a drop in tourist numbers after the Gulf war, has told
staff it will review the pay freeze, which started on April 1, in the
autumn.
Harrods, owned by House of Fraser, had offered its non-managerial staff a 3
per cent increase from April 1 with a further 2 per cent in October.
Usdaw, which will be meeting senior representatives of Harrods on Thursday
to ask them to re-open pay negotiations, said the offer was withdrawn on
Friday and a pay freeze announced. Last month Harrods told all its 600
managerial staff that their pay was being frozen.
Pay freezes have been adopted by a significant number of employers this year
but Laura Ashley Holdings, the fashion and household retailer, was so far
believed to be the only high-street retailer among them. Pay awards in the
retail sector have been averaging about 9 per cent to 10 per cent although
members of the Multiple Shoe Retailers' Association restricted pay rises for
19-to-21-year-olds to 5 per cent.
Earlier this year Harrods shed 200 staff. The redundancy programme was to
have been larger, but was trimmed after staff protests. It was prompted by
poor trading conditions in February.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): TUC finds few deals on recognition at
new plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS appear to have found it increasingly difficult in the past three
years to gain recognition agreements from inward investors and British
companies setting up new plants, a senior TUC official said yesterday.
Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, said only 10 deals had been
notified to the TUC since October 1988 under a procedure to regulate
inter-union conflict of the kind which led to the expulsion of the EETPU
electricians' union.
Under the prior-notification procedure, which was made permanent in June
last year, unions should tell the TUC about any single-union deal they are
about to sign.
Mr Monks told a conference in London that the number of deals was 'very
small' compared with the rush of agreements signed in the mid-1980s.
He added that the TUC might support establishing the size of union
membership in a company by a workforce ballot instead of a petition drawn up
by a union, saying this method might be 'politically advisable' in order to
gain public support for TUC proposals.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Non-managerial staff reject 5% Midland
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK, the last of the big four clearing banks to enter pay
negotiations this year, has offered its 35,000 non-managerial staff a rise
of 5 per cent from June 1.
The offer was rejected by union negotiators and both sides will meet again
at the end of the week. Only a small improvement is expected on the offer,
and it is likely that the final settlement will fall at the lower end of
this year's likely 5-7 1/2 per cent range of pay increases for the clearers.
Midland's poor financial performance led it to halve its dividend earlier
this year.
Pressure on Midland's management to increase the offer will be reduced to
some extent by the June settlement date and what is expected to be a
continuing drop in inflation before then. The other main clearing banks' pay
increases take effect from February and April.
Mr Ed Sweeney, deputy general secretary elect of the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union, said that Midland's negotiators had also drawn attention to
an offer of 5 per cent by Lloyds Bank to its 46,000 non-managerial staff.
Lloyds has said there is no further room for improvement on the offer,
although more talks are due to take place today.
Barclays' staff have already settled for a rise of more than 7 per cent and
NatWest has implemented a 7.5 per cent rise as part of a deal that will
allow the bank to require more flexible starting times from its employees.
Unions and management at TSB are also due to meet again at the end of the
week following an increase in the pay offer to staff from 6.75 per cent to 7
per cent.
Bifu members are being balloted on industrial action at Lombard North
Central. The National Union of Mineworkers has offered to back a recognition
claim by the banking union Bifu at the North of England Building Society by
urging NUM members to withdraw their savings from the society. Bifu has not
taken up the offer 'for the moment', it said, because the move could
threaten the livelihood of its members.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Hopes rise for the high street stock shop: NatWest's plans
to gear up for the widening of share ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster knows better than most that timing is everything. The
bank has been pondering for sometime how to establish a new market for small
companies. It decided to push its proposal forward only when Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, called for ideas on widening share ownership.
The London Stock Exchange was always going to pour cold water on the concept
of a rival market for small companies. Yesterday its chairman, Mr Andrew
Hugh Smith, could not resist asking just how NatWest thought it could find
buyers for shares in tiny businesses.
As he sees it, it is one thing to buy shares from Mrs Brown in Newcastle but
it is another to sell them to Mr Jones in Truro. Just who wants shares in
penny-halfpenny companies? As far as the stock exchange is concerned, there
is no way of answering the question, which is why there is no rival market.
NatWest disagrees. It believes there are two possible solutions: it could
establish a group of independent agents tied to NatWest, specialising in
small companies and buying shares from individual investors; or it could
link with a third party acting as a broker marketing shares acquired by
NatWest.
Since the demise of the Third Market at the end of last year, the bank's
stockbrokers have been convinced that they could offer those companies a new
home.
It also believes it could pick up unlisted businesses, which typically have
1m shares at Pounds 1 each, as well as some of the smaller companies quoted
on the Unlisted Securities Market.
The USM was set up on November 10 1980 to provide a separately regulated and
more flexible market for smaller companies.
NatWest believes it could offer many of the smaller USM-quoted companies
easier access to the public at an earlier stage of their development.
NatWest established a share dealing service in December 1986, for the
privatisation of British Gas and it has been thinking of ways of developing
its service.
In January 1988 it extended its touch-screen share-dealing operation
throughout the country. In 278 of the bank's 2,900 branches, investors can
buy or sell shares in 550 companies.
In spite of the operation's initial success, the branches do an average of
only 10 deals a day each.
Mr Neil Stapley, managing director of NatWest Stockbrokers, assigned a
project team to look at ways to extend that service. The team calculated
that a market for small companies would be relatively cheap to establish.
When the Treasury issued a press release in March asking for ideas to sell
the shares it owns in BT, NatWest Stockbrokers seized on a supplementary
question. The chancellor wanted to know how high-street share shops could
develop throughout the country - he was not interested just in the BT sale
but in widening share ownership generally.
That was good enough for NatWest. It is relying on the Treasury to keep to
its side of the deal and will come up with the ideas if Whitehall throws its
weight behind them in the face of stock exchange hostility.
To be fair to Mr Hugh Smith, he has made it clear that the bank is in an
ideal situation to establish a market in small shares. If it decides to set
up a rival market, Mr Hugh Smith does not think it should necessarily be
judged as a challenge to the exchange. Others are not so sure.
Mr Brian Winterflood, managing director of Winterflood Securities, which
offers a share service in 830 small companies, said NatWest had
'state-of-the-art' technology to offer a first-rate market for small
companies.
'It has the capability to challenge the stock exchange,' he said.

FT  14 MAY 91 / New truck sales down by 46%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW TRUCK sales plunged in April by 46 per cent, compared with the same
month last year, to only 2,647, as the recession deepened further in leading
sectors of the UK commercial vehicles market.
The truck industry is suffering the steepest two-year slide into recession
in the post-war period, with most UK truck makers operating at a loss.
Truck registrations (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) in the first
four months - at 11,562 - were 39.7 per cent lower than a year ago,
according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Sales have dropped by 54.9 per cent in the past two years from the 25,638
achieved in the first four months of 1989.
The collapse in sales has been led by the heavy truck sector (above 15
tonnes), where sales in the first four months this year - at 5,452 - were
43.4 per cent lower than a year ago and 61.6 per cent lower than in the
corresponding period of 1989.
Overall, new commercial vehicle registrations in April fell by 27.6 per cent
to 19,406, compared with the same month last year, while sales in the first
four months were 31.6 per cent lower than a year ago, at 79,457. Sales of
imported vehicles have been hardest hit in the recession, and their share in
the first four months fell to 35.6 per cent from 39.5 per cent a year ago.
In the truck market Leyland DAF, UK subsidiary of DAF of the Netherlands,
established a narrow lead in the first four months ahead of Iveco Ford.
Leyland DAF increased its share of the overall truck market (above 3.5
tonnes) to 24.5 per cent from 24 per cent a year ago, while Iveco Ford's
share dropped to 24.2 per cent from 24.9 per cent in the corresponding
period a year ago.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Cardiff hospitals may lose 200 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SOME 200 jobs are likely to be lost in Cardiff hospitals as a result of the
decision of South Glamorgan Health Authority to privatise its cleaning
services, writes Anthony Moreton.
The authority says the move will lead to a saving of 'just under Pounds 1m,
which will be ploughed back into patient services'.
The authority, which has responsibility for the University of Wales teaching
hospital as well as the city's Royal Infirmary, has followed government
policy by opening up cleaning services to the private sector.
The service companies estimate they will need about 800 of the present 1,000
staff.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Brooke hopeful on reviving Irish talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BROOKE, North-ern Ireland secretary, last night appeared hopeful
that he could resuscitate talks on the province's political future. But he
admitted that time was not on his side.
After a fourth day of talks in Belfast with Unionist and nationalist leaders
about the venue for talks involving the Irish government, Mr Brooke
suggested he was making some headway in reaching a compromise. 'Serious
business is being done,' he said.
However, Mr Brooke was careful not to raise hopes after what has proved an
acrimonious debate over the location for talks on relations between north
and south Ireland. 'I don't think time is on our side,' he admitted, adding:
'I don't want to get overexcited.'
The row has dominated the first two weeks out of the 11 set aside for the
talks. At this stage the participants were supposed to be discussing
devolved government in the province. Mr Brooke will meet Unionist leaders
and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party again today at
Stormont parliament buildings outside Belfast.
An incident yesterday which highlighted the cost of failure was the murder
by the IRA of Mr Robert Orr, a businessman and member of the loyalist Orange
Order. A bomb exploded under his car as he waited at lights in Armagh.
Mr Brooke appears to have stopped short of issuing an ultimatum over a venue
with the threat of ending the talks if agreement cannot be reached. He is
understood to be working on variations of a proposal for holding talks with
the Irish government first in London, then Belfast, then Dublin.
Unionists insist they cannot hold talks with Dublin ministers anywhere in
Ireland while the Republic's constitutional claim on Northern Ireland
remains. The SDLP believes meetings should rotate between London, Dublin and
Belfast.

FT  14 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Paper to NatWest board was rewritten,
jury is told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PAPER on County NatWest's handling of the parcels of Blue Arrow shares
taken by advisers to the September 1987 rights issue was rewritten within
the parent bank to make it 'softer and vaguer' before being presented to the
NatWest board, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday.
The purpose of the re-drafting was to put the paper into a form that could
be considered by the board, which included non-executive directors, Mr
Leslie Collett, former secretary to the County chairman's committee, agreed
with Mr Alun Jones QC.
Changes made while the paper was in the office of Mr Thomas Frost, the
NatWest group chief executive, had the effect of making the problems facing
County after the stock market crash seem much less urgent, Mr Jones, for Mr
Stephen Clark, a County director, said.
Mr Collett agreed with him that the changes had made the paper softer and
vaguer, and made it appear that the discussions over the future of the
holdings were not too far advanced.
Although the paper finally presented to the NatWest board on December 8 was
signed by Mr Jonathan Cohen, the former County chief executive, it had been
very carefully rewritten 'at the behest' of people at NatWest, including Mr
Frost and Mr Terence Green, the former NWB deputy chief executive, he
agreed.
Between November 23, when a number of County executives met to discuss the
holding, and December 8 1987, a strategic planning department within the
parent bank was involved in the redrafting of the paper, he said.
Mr Collett also agreed that the legal advice given at the meeting on
November 23 by Mr Alan Keat, a defendant, and Mr Nigel Campion-Smith,
solicitors from Travers Smith Braithwaite, was that no immediate disclosure
of the holdings was necessary.
He was questioned later by Mr Anthony Hooper QC, for Mr David Reed, a former
County director, over the legal advice given by Mr Campion-Smith at a
meeting held on September 23, before the issue closed, at which County's
possible buying of shares was discussed.
'Mr Campion-Smith didn't say 'Watch it, that is a conspiracy to defraud if
you do what we have discussed'?' Mr Hooper asked.
Mr Collett replied: 'I don't think he said anything akin to it at all.'
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals, including Mr Clark, Mr Cohen, Mr Keat and Mr Reed, deny
conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the Pounds 837m issue.
The trial continues today.

FT  14 MAY 91 / City regulators angry over Taurus decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's decision to hand regulatory responsibility for Taurus, the
stock market's planned settlement system, to the stock exchange was greeted
with barely concealed anger in some City regulatory circles yesterday.
Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, has decided not to give the
task to the existing investment watchdogs for fear of adding to the
bureaucracy created by the Financial Services Act.
Yet some investment regulators argue that giving the job to the exchange,
with the Department of Trade and Industry retaining overall responsibility,
will lead to conflicts between regulatory agencies, and will expose
'horrendous' conflicts of interest within the exchange.
It will mean that both the exchange and the existing self-regulating
organisations will be responsible for assessing whether an investment firm
is 'fit and proper' to operate. Differences of opinion could cause problems,
one senior regulator said privately yesterday.
'We all feel it won't work. It will fall down where there is a difference of
opinion,' he said.
A further difficulty, he said, was that the exchange would act as regulator
and commercial operator of Taurus. This would create conflicts of interest,
as it would be forced at times to discipline investment firms that were in
fact among its biggest customers.
Mr Redwood's decision, conveyed to regulators last Friday, is due to be
announced formally on Thursday when the DTI publishes its long-awaited legal
regulations paving the way for Taurus.
At the same time, he will announce an annual ceiling for the Taurus
compensation scheme of Pounds 100m - far less than the Pounds 1bn he had
urged earlier, but more than the Pounds 50m originally proposed by the
exchange.
The launch of Taurus - probably in about a year - will create an important
regulatory task. The many brokers, custodians, registrars and others linked
electronically to the system will need to be assessed on their technical
expertise and their fitness and properness, as well as their capital
adequacy. Giving this job to the existing investment regulators would have
brought registrars, custodians and nominees within the scope of the FSA -
something that the DTI, already recoiling from the over-complexity of the
existing regulatory structure, was not willing to do.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Nissan wins first round in fight with importer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN MOTOR of Japan won an initial victory yesterday in its High Court
battle with Nissan UK, its privately-owned importer, by persuading the court
to hear at least the first part of the action behind closed doors.
Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest car maker, is trying to avoid an
embarrassing open confrontation in the English courts by having its dispute
with Nissan UK referred to arbitration in Japan.
It argues that under the terms of the original distribution agreement, which
came into effect at the beginning of 1971, any disputes or legal proceedings
were to be settled in Japan.
Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, the vice-chancellor, agreed to Nissan Motor's
request that the issue of jurisdiction over the dispute should be heard in
chambers.
He said his judgment would probably be given in open court, and the second
part of the action - Nissan UK's attempt to win an injunction preventing
Nissan Motor from selling vehicles to any other distributor - would be heard
in open court.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Labour rules out drastic reform for accountancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party is unlikely to seek immediate and drastic reforms of the
UK's accountancy profession if it wins the next election, the party's
discussion paper on its plans for accountants and auditors made clear.
In the paper, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, opposition City spokesman, states that the
current regulatory regime, whereby auditors are to be monitored by the
professional bodies under the Companies Act 1989, is unsatisfactory.
But the remedies put forward in the document fall far short of those being
expounded by Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby and a former
frontbench spokesman, who has attacked the accounting status quo.
Yesterday's document shows that Labour has no immediate plans to curtail the
consultancy work done by firms of auditors for their audit clients, or to
insist on the rotation of auditors after a fixed period. These are among the
more radical reforms advocated by Mr Mitchell.
The document welcomes the recent improvements to the way in which accounting
standards are set and monitored. It suggests that similar improvements ought
to be made to the regulation of auditors.
'There is no doubt that the current institutional arrangements are
unsatisfactory,' the document says. 'There is a need for (more input from
outside the profession) and generally greater transparency of proceedings
and recommendations.'
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales yesterday
challenged the view of Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading,
that the proposed regulations restricting non-auditors to ownership or
control of no more than 25 per cent of auditing firms are uncompetitive. The
institute told Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, that the
restriction was essential to safeguard auditors' independence.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Small companies may lose in EC public deals race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL AND medium-sized British companies are in danger of losing out to
Continental competitors as the market for public procurement opens up in the
next few years. This was the warning yesterday from Sir John Cuckney,
chairman of a National Economic Development Council working party on open
public procurement in the European Community.
Sir John, chairman of 3i, the venture-capital investment group owned by the
Bank of England and the clearing banks, said small and medium-sized
companies were in danger of sticking their heads in the sand just as their
public-sector markets were about to undergo a huge transition.
He was speaking at the launch of a working party to examine the likely
impact of open public procurement on British companies over the next 18
months.
Under the single-market programme the EC is issuing a series of directives
designed to eliminate barriers to cross-border trade in public services.
Public procurement in the EC is worth about Pounds 430bn a year.
The working party is the first NEDC body to include representatives from the
Continent: Mr Bernado Cremades, a leading Spanish lawyer; Mr Bernard
Gosselin, the secretary-general responsible for public purchasing at the
French ministry of economy and finance; Mr Preben Jackobsen, director of the
Danish directorate for state purchasing; and Peter Prince Wittgenstein a
member of the executive board of German engineering group Mannesmann.
The working group plans to examine the market for public-sector building and
infrastructure projects including their design, local authority public
purchasing, markets to supply health authorities in the EC, and the supply
of services in general.
Among other things, the working party will study whether there are unfair
barriers to British companies bidding for contracts on the Continent.
Sir John said the working party would be just as concerned with the outlook
for large companies as for small ones, and added: 'It will take some time
before groups either gain the economies of scale or the specialisation to
move into exports outside the EC.'
The working party plans to issue British companies with practical guidance
on how to bid for public-sector contracts on the continent.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Fiscal studies institute backs local income tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOCAL TAX based on property values is backed as the best short-term
replacement for the poll tax in an independent report published yesterday.
But the report, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, advocates the
introduction of a local income tax in the longer term to raise additional
revenue.
The report emphasises that what matters more than the method of raising
finance is that whatever is chosen should be sustainable and able to survive
changes in national government.
The institute says that the economic case for a property tax, as now
advocated by both the government and the Labour party, is strong because
property enjoys substantial fiscal privileges in the UK and should bear its
share of taxation.
On valuation, Mr Michael Ridge and Mr Stephen Smith of the IFS, who wrote
the report, prefer the use of capital values as favoured by the government
rather than rental values. But they are unconvinced of the need for
'banding' categories of property by value.
'We see no great merit in rough and ready forms of valuation (numbers of
rooms etc.) nor in banding,' they say. 'Both are likely to lead to more
perceived inequity in the treatment of similar properties than with a
conventional capital valuation; banding in particular seems unlikely to
promise much saving in valuation and administration costs, since the tax
implications of being placed in one band rather than another are likely to
provoke taxpayers to contest the valuation in borderline cases.'
The advantage of a local income tax, which is advocated by the Liberal
Democrats, is that it could raise more revenue than is now raised from local
taxation. That could be important, as funding a high proportion of local
government from central grants has often been seen as a source of
instability in council finances.
There would be a problem of timing, however. A property tax could be
introduced quickly - the government is aiming at April 1993 - whereas any
form of local income tax would require a much longer timescale.
'In the longer term, however, if it is intended that local taxes should
contribute more to the costs of local government, we see no alternative to
the eventual introduction of a local income tax, either as a supplement to,
or replacing, property taxation,' the authors state.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Plans to aid low-cost housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANNING arrangements are to be made more flexible to encourage builders to
provide a greater number of low-cost homes.
But planning minister Sir George Young, announcing the changes, said he had
rejected the idea that local authorities should have the power to insist on
a fixed quota of cheaper homes when they grant planning permission.
This has disappointed conservationists, who would like to see councils given
mandatory powers to make developers provide a proportion of cheaper houses
and flats in new developments.
'It is a missed opportunity,' said Mr Tony Burton, planning officer for the
Council for the Protection of Rural England. 'It has not given the local
authorities the powers they need to be effective.'
The scheme mainly applies to rural areas where the influx of well-paid house
purchasers from urban areas has sent prices up beyond the reach of local
people.
Sir George is asking local authorities to negotiate with developers to
include a proportion of low-cost housing.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Brokers find Scots power promising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO Scottish electricity companies are more attractive to investors than
the privatised English generators and regional electricity companies,
according to Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker. The Scottish companies
are due to be floated on May 30.
The comment came in the first brokers' circular to be produced since the
government published the pathfinder prospectus for ScottishPower and
Scottish Hydro-Electric last week. Laing believes the two Scottish companies
have good prospects for profits growth in the generating side of their
businesses, which accounts for 30 per cent of ScottishPower's profits and 55
per cent of those of Hydro-Electric.
The companies will be able to increase their earnings from generation as the
transmission interconnector, which links the Scottish grid to the national
grid in England and Wales, is expanded by 1994.
The analysts point out that the Scottish companies will have an 'enduring
advantage' over other generators because the Miller field in the North Sea
will start producing cheap gas next year, and the benefits will be shared by
both companies. Hydro-Electric also have another advantage only partly
shared with ScottishPower because of its low-cost hydro-electric capacity.
A further advantage is that after 1994, when customers using between 1MW and
10MW may choose suppliers, tariffs in Scotland are set to move only
gradually into line with pool prices rather than instantly, as in England.
But the Laing analysts, Mr Robert Giles and Mr Arthur Hepher, point out that
the Scottish companies can expect lower real earnings growth in distribution
and transmission because the government has set them harsher X-factors.
Those require them to increase their tariffs by less than the rise in the
retail prices index. The regional electricity companies are allowed to
exceed the rise.
The analysts believe the market may prefer Hydro-Electric because of its
vigorous management and success in winning new business.
They believe the two Scottish companies should justify a lower yield than
the current average of 5.2 per cent for the English generators. But they
expect the government to float them on a 5.2 per cent yield in order to
produce a 20p premium on the part-paid price of Pounds 1. With the premium
they would yield 4.8 per cent after flotation.

THE BREWERS' Society yesterday called on the government to allow pubs in
England and Wales to employ 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds and to admit
children under 14 for family meals.
The proposals were part of a submission on the licensing laws sent to Mr
Peter Lloyd, a junior Home Office minister. Such moves 'would allow the
consumer greater choice and offer increased opportunities for the licensed
trade over the next decade', the society said.
It said the ban on employment of young people prevented the recruitment of
good-quality employees and the development of career paths for new
licensees.
The society recognised that strict controls would be required. It suggested
that young staff should be registered with local Training and Enterprise
Councils and should be under the direct supervision of licensees.
Pubs in England and Wales, like those in Scotland, should be able to apply
to licensing justices for children's certificates allowing under-14s in bars

FT  14 MAY 91 / BR given go-ahead for extra carriages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL has received government permission to order extra carriages
worth Pounds 67.3m for the commuter trains shortly to start operating
between London and north-west Kent.
The decision will come as a relief to BR and its passengers because a heavy
overshoot in the corporation's budget for the past financial year has placed
many of its investment plans in jeopardy.
The order approved yesterday is for 43 two-car Networker trains similar to
the 100 four-car Networkers already ordered for the inner Kent suburban
lines.
The four-car trains being built by BREL, the former engineering arm of BR,
and GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, will make up eight-car
formations which will start replacing the 40-year-old slam-door trains on
these routes in May next year.
The trains being replaced are the same as that involved in London's Cannon
Street rail crash in January, which killed two people and injured more than
250.
When the two-car trains start being delivered in 1993, they will be added to
the eight-car trains to make up 10-car formations. BR hopes eventually to
convert these trains to 12-car formations to cope with continuing traffic
growth.
BR had earlier hoped to win approval for new trains for the longer-distance
Kent Coast routes, but these had to be dropped from the investment programme
because of the corporation's financial crisis.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA yesterday rejected EC claims that it would be forced to tone down
its campaign in Gatt's Uruguay Round for free trade in agricultural
products, Kevin Brown reports from Sydney. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture
commissioner, had suggested Australia would be forced to soften its stance
under pressure for subsidies from farmers hit by recession and falling world
prices.
Mr Neal Blewett, trade negotiations minister, said Mr MacSharry's remarks
were 'discouraging and inaccurate', and claimed Australia was resisting
pressure for subsidies. The EC should emulate Australia's 'political
courage' by moving away from export subsidies to farmers, he told
parliament. Australia chairs the Cairns Group of farm exporting nations,
which has pushed strongly for extending trade liberalisation to food
products.
Australia's refusal to aid wheat growers, partly from fear of weakening its
Gatt negotiating stance, has been attacked by its farming groups, which say
planting for next year's crop could be cut 35 per cent. But Canberra has
approved a ADollars 100m (Pounds 45m) rise in the Grains Council of
Australia's borrowing limit, to allow advance payments to growers, and has
expanded its Rural Adjustment Scheme, to help farmers cope.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Wage discord in Argentine military fuels unrest fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DISCONTENT in Argentina's armed forces over low pay and declining budgets
has raised new fears of military unrest, five months after the government
crushed the fourth mutiny since the restoration of democracy in 1983.
The commanders of the army, air force and navy met yesterday to analyse each
service's financial problems. The meetings are intended to put pressure on
the government for immediate wage rises and a general increase in military
spending.
Last week the navy's second-in-command said Argentina was defenceless, while
Mr Erman Gonzalez, defence minister, complained that General Martn Bonnet,
army commander, earned only Dollars 1,500 (Pounds 872) a month compared with
a congressman's salary of Dollars 3,500.
However, Mr Gonzalez said the military's demands were 'logical, but
politically difficult to digest. I have no doubt that military discipline
will prevail. Coups d'etat are things of the past.'
None the less, one leading military analyst warned that another mutiny later
this year was inevitable unless the government increased wages.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister battling to contain government
spending, firmly rejected the generals' demands.
Argentina's military budget is about Dollars 2bn, or 2 per cent of its gross
domestic product, with wages alone accounting for 80 per cent of spending.
The generals' demand for a 30-40 per cent wage increase would add about
Dollars 40m-Dollars 53m a month to government expenditure.
President Carlos Menem's support for Mr Cavallo forced the commanders to
cancel a joint meeting planned for today at which they and senior officers
were to have resigned, triggering confrontation with the government.
Argentina and South Africa are in negotiations to re-establish diplomatic
relations and resume sporting links.
If the talks are successful, Argentina will become the first country to lift
the international sports boycott, with an August tour of Argentina by the
Springboks rugby team.
Diplomatic relations, which were broken off in 1986, should be resumed later
this year.

FT  14 MAY 91 / No-boom Midwest survives without bust / A look at why the
downturn has been less severely felt than in the rest of the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISITORS to Chicago from recession-racked cities such as New York and Boston
are surprised - even envious - to find there is little sign of economic
gloom in the Windy City. The American Midwest, of which Chicago is the
financial and industrial capital, is weathering the current US recession
relatively painlessly.
The secret to the Midwest's success is not that it is enjoying a miraculous
renaissance but that it did most of its hurtful shrinkage and
belt-tightening in the early and mid-1980s.
While regions such as New England were revelling in 1980s booms, the Midwest
was becoming 'slimmer and grimmer', says Mr Haskell Benishay, professor of
managerial economics at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of
Management. Or as the refrain among Midwest economic analysts goes, 'No
boom, no bust.'
The US recession of 1981 prompted a significant cut in Midwestern productive
capacity and a higher technology retooling. In addition, the farming sector
has emerged from a mid-1980s agricultural slump competitively leaner and far
less in debt.
Several key factors are involved in allowing the Midwest to ease through the
American economic downturn, including the relative health of the property
market, a boost of exports helped by a lower valued dollar, and the
attraction of investment to the region, in particular by the Japanese.
While there is some weakness in the Midwest property market, it is doing
better than other American regions. Midwestern housing did not appreciate in
the 1980s; now there is an incipient housing pick-up.
According to Commerce Department figures, Midwestern housing permits rose 14
per cent in March compared with December last year. February housing starts
were up 77 per cent on January's levels.
Regional home values actually rose last year and are even expected to
outperform other parts of the country during the 1990s, according to Ms
Diane Swonk, regional economist for the First National Bank of Chicago.
The declining trend in the US dollar has buoyed Midwestern exports and
foreign sales. US capital goods exports hit a record high in the fourth
quarter of 1990 and much of America's capital goods production is
concentrated in the Midwest, according to Mr John Silvia, chief economist
for Kemper Financial Services.
While there are no good statistics on regional exports, the state of
Illinois said its exports increased last year by 24 per cent and state
officials expect these to rise again this year by 12 per cent.
Chicago area-based Illinois Tool Works saw foreign sales jump to 50 per cent
of its total of Dollars 2.54bn (Pounds 1.47bn) last year. Although ITW
produces much of what it sells overseas at its plants abroad, the 1990
portion of its foreign sales was double what it was five years ago, said Mr
W. H. Farrell, ITW's executive vice-president.
More noteworthy still, Mr Farrell said, the company recently halted plans to
invest further in Germany, choosing instead to produce at home and export.
He said the US was a better prospect than Europe regarding costs for
building, fuel, and wage and benefits packages.
While Midwest wages are regarded as high in comparison with those in other
parts of the country, productivity is also higher.
This is one of the reasons why 60 per cent of the American motor vehicle
industry remains in the Midwest. But the industry is both the blessing and
the curse of the region.
It provides many well-paid manufacturing jobs; but its cyclical nature, with
the concomitant problems of unemployment and drops in local consumer
spending, is a big disadvantage.
The large number of recent plant closures by Detroit's Big Three car-makers
has hurt the Midwest in particular, and more pain is forecast because of
continuing industry overcapacity. The Japanese transplants have, however,
helped offset the regional job losses. And, even with a slack US car market,
their plans to export Japanese cars to Europe promise to help keep them
running at capacity.
The best-laid export plans may, however, be spoiled if the dollar continues
its recent upward path. But with respect to domestic-destined industrial
production, the Midwest has been lucky never to have become heavily
dependent, as have other areas, on defence spending. The pull-back in
defence spending has hit other regions, such as New England and the west,
far harder.
The Midwest will, however, have to cope with some serious problems ahead:
its infrastructure is ageing; its population is declining; its foreign trade
could become uncompetitive as the dollar shifts and other regions re-tool
with more advanced technology. The free trade agreement with Mexico could
also further siphon off manufacturing, especially car industry, jobs.
Midwest banks, reflecting the national picture, are also due for some
shrinkage because of over-capacity.
'We're coming back from a very weak position. But now, we're going to have
to fight for every inch,' said Mr Robert Schnorbus, business conditions
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

THE Canadian government will seek powers to hold a national referendum or

deal with Quebec and other changes in the country's political structure,
writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The government said in a Throne Speech during the opening of parliament in
Ottawa yesterday that it planned to reveal its proposals for a new
constitution this September. A parliamentary commission will consult widely
with the provinces and the public on proposals, and aim to report by
February 1992.
The initiatives seek to calm fears that forthcoming talks with Quebec and
the other nine provinces will occur without full public participation.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Trade News: NEI Reyrolle wins Pounds 100m Dubai power
order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEI REYROLLE, part of Rolls-Royce's industrial power group, has won the UK's
largest Middle Eastern order since the end of the Gulf War with a turnkey
contract worth more than Pounds 100m to supply three sub-stations to Dubai,
Andrew Baxter reports.
The closely-fought contract is the biggest export order for Reyrolle, which
provides switchgear and sub-stations for transmitting and distributing
electricity, and the largest transmission sub-station contract awarded to a
UK company.
Reyrolle is part of Northern Engineering Industries, which was bought by
Rolls-Royce in 1989. The contract is NEI's biggest since 1982, when it won
an order, then worth Pounds 230m, for the Rihand coal-fired power station
project in India.
NEI said yesterday that the Dubai order would provide extra job security
over the next two years for 2,000 Reyrolle workers at Hebburn, Tyneside, and
create 'a few extra jobs'.
NEI Peebles at Edinburgh, which employs 500, will also benefit from the
contract by supplying eight transformers.
NEI has been relatively successful in the Middle East, with Reyrolle
recently completing its third substation in Saudi Arabia since 1987 in a
series of deals worth about Pounds 80m. NEI Power Projects has also
completed work on converting five gas turbines at a Bahrain aluminium plant
to the more efficient combined cycle operation.
But NEI was hit badly by UN sanctions against Iraq after the invasion of
Kuwait. This prevented the company from supplying four turbine generators,
worth about Pounds 70m, for a power station at Al Shemal and caused 650 job
losses at NEI Parsons in Newcastle.
The Dubai contract is for three 400kV substations, and includes the supply
of 28 circuits of 400kV gas-insulated switchgear. Work will start
immediately, and construction and commissioning continue into early 1993.
Reyrolle will subcontract the civil design and construction to SAE Sadelmi,
the Italian electrical contractor, while Kennedy and Donkin of the UK will
be the consulting engineers. Mr Graham Shepley, Reyrolle managing director,
said the news reinforced Reyrolle's position 'as a world leader in
sub-station design and construction'.
James Buxton writes: Weir Westgarth, the subsidiary of the Glasgow-based
Weir Group, has won a contract worth Pounds 70m for a desalination plant at
Jebel Ali in Dubai. The plant is part of a project worth about Pounds 500m
for a gas turbine and desalination plant which will provide 400MW of power
and 60m imperial gallons of drinking water, with the waste heat from the
turbines being used in the desalination plant.

NEPALESE voters appear to have delivered an upset by voting communist in the
capital, Kathmandu, in the nation's first multi-party parliamentary
elections in 32 years.
Preliminary results suggest the Communist party defeated the centrist Nepali
Congress Party in all five Kathmandu constituencies, including the seat
contested by Mr Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, leader of the Congress party. He
has been prime minister of the coalition cabinet that has ruled Nepal since
last year's revolt against the king.
Mr Bhattarai ran against Mr Madhan Kumar Mandari, general secretary of the
Communist party.
Counting began for 29 of the country's 205 parliamentary constituencies
yesterday.
Twenty one out of the 205 constituencies will hold new elections today after
charges of irregularities, ranging from stuffing ballot boxes to dumping
ballots in the river.
Final results of the election are expected later this week.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Royal Marines are believed to have wounded two Iraqi soldiers in an
exchange of fire near one of President Saddam Hussein's palaces in northern
Iraq.
Allied forces sealed off the area, close to the town of Amadiyah, as the
atmosphere remained tense.
The incident reportedly began when Iraqi troops fired three rounds from the
palace across the front of a marine position. The British forces did not
return fire then.
Almost two hours later, a high-velocity round was fired at the UK position
from the same area and the marines replied with a single shot from the post
at Ayn Shaykh, close to Amadiyah and inside the allies' safe haven.
Five minutes later, two men emerged from a blockhouse on the palace wall and
fired 'long bursts' with automatic weapons, a UK military spokesman said.
'Royal Marines returned fire and they believe two Iraqis were hit.'
Shortly afterwards, two more shots were fired from the palace.
Iraq later issued a statement denying it had been involved in an exchange of
fire with marines.
In Zhako, several hundred Kurds besieged 50 Iraqi police in the local police
station before US troops persuaded the crowd to disperse.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Charity counts blessings amid aid fatigue / A look at
Christian Aid as it launches its 35th annual appeal for funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE many crises that have hit the developing world this year, a new one
has recently been added: aid fatigue. Christian Aid, however, which
yesterday launched the 35th Christian Aid week, claims so far to be immune.
Although the Charities Aid Foundation has estimated that average household
donations in Britain dropped by a third in recent years, Christian Aid's
income in the last financial year held up well.
'We don't seem to have been affected by aid fatigue. Our support seems to
have been maintained, even during the last three months,' says Mr Paul
Tyler, head of finance at Christian Aid. This may be because of Christian
Aid's link with the churches.
It is sponsored by 41 churches and benefits from church fund raising.
Christian Aid week is Britain's biggest regular fund-raising event - and the
longest-running. Last year it raised Pounds 6.7m and this year hopes for at
least Pounds 8m, with 400,000 volunteers delivering 16m collecting envelopes
throughout Britain.
The charity has come a long way from its roots as Christian Reconstruction
in Europe, when it was set up in 1944 to help rebuild church and family life
across the war-torn continent. One grant from its first Pounds 1m - raised
through Victory in Europe collections and church grants - went towards
buying hundreds of bicycles to enable clergy on the continent to get around
their ruined parishes. Another funded a caravan stocked by Sainsburys on the
Austro-Hungarian border to feed Hungarian refugees.
In later decades the charity, renamed Christian Aid, built on its experience
of refugee relief and resettlement in Europe and now works in more than 70
countries.
It differs from all the overseas aid agencies except Cafod, the Catholic
Fund for Overseas Development, in that it does not have its own staff based
overseas, but works through indigenous church and other organisations. It
aims to be an 'enabler', providing the funds and the means for local people
to carry out aid and development work.
'Setting up an expatriate operation abroad is very time-consuming and
costly, and it's very difficult to shift from that to something
sustainable,' says Mr Paul Spray, head of aid.
'If you start with an organisation that is already there and set up, the
chances of sustaining it are much greater.'
Although the charity received about a third of its Pounds 33m income last
year from government sources, most of it from the Overseas Development
Agency for disaster relief, most of the rest was spent not on disaster
relief but on long-term development programmes such as providing medical
assistance in India, installing solar-powered water pumps in Somalia, and
leadership training and advising farmers in Chile.
Christian Aid shares its funds almost equally among churches, other
Christian organisations, and secular groups.
Education and campaigning inevitably plays an important part in Christian
Aid's work, accounting for up to 10 per cent of expenditure - and can be a
source of criticism, although the charity has so far avoided any clashes
with the Charity Commission, the British charities watchdog. The commission
last week published a report instructing Oxfam, Britain's biggest overseas
aid charity, to stop mixing politics with charitable work, which could have
important implications for other organisations such as Christian Aid.
'There is an area of unclarity about what charities can do,' says Michael
Taylor, Christian Aid's director. 'But you can't have charity without
politics. If a charity has a real concern for the good of the poor, it must
be prepared to encourage governments to adopt policies that help the
situation and don't make it worse.'

THE Soviet parliament last night again failed to guarantee its citizens the
right of free travel abroad, after one of the Supreme Soviet's two houses
refused to pass an emigration bill on grounds of expense, writes John Lloyd
in Moscow.
The bill has been two years in preparation, and received its first reading
18 months ago. It will probably come back to the Supreme Soviet on Thursday,
when a commission set up to break the impasse is expected to produce a
compromise.
Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, a deputy foreign minister, said yesterday that
discussion of the bill was confined to expense and technicalities, not to
principles. However, many of those arguing against the bill were from the
hardline Soyuz camp.
The bill guarantees that Soviet citizens who apply to travel abroad will
receive their passports within a month, while those who wish to emigrate
will get them in three months. . No Soviet citizen will be denied entry, as
many dissidents have in the past.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Cossiga rebukes top judge in row over Mafia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S President Francesco Cossiga has withdrawn his support for Mr
Giovanni Galloni, the deputy president of the Consiglio Superiore della
Magistratura (CSM), the ruling body for the judiciary, in a public row over
increasing Mafia violence.
In a step bound to trigger a new crisis between the presidency and the legal
establishment, Mr Cossiga yesterday revoked Mr Galloni's powers to represent
him as constitutional head of the CSM.
Mr Cossiga, who as head of state is also head of the CSM, cannot sack Mr
Galloni, as he is elected independently by judges and magistrates.
The president's unprecedented step, which has come as a shock to judges and
politicians alike, follows growing friction with Mr Galloni and the
judiciary on the question of organised crime, notably in southern Italy.
Gang warfare in the south, especially Calabria, has reached new heights in
the past fortnight, with almost daily tit-for-tat murders.
The latest clash between the president and the judiciary follows a call by
Mr Cossiga last week for special measures to fight crime. Among other
suggestions, he spoke out against sending inexperienced young magistrates to
the south.
'It is unbelievable that, just because he has passed an exam in Roman law, a
young man is able to conduct complex investigations into the Mafia and the
drugs trade,' he said.
That provoked a quick response from Mr Galloni in the name of judicial
independence. 'The young people thrown into the most difficult regions
should be thanked and cannot be - I won't say insulted - but repudiated in
their functions,' he said.

A man inspects the wreck of a Soviet military vehicle at a former barracks
in Forst Zinna, a village near Juterborg in east Germany. In the background
is scrap, also left by Soviet troops when they went home. Waste left
elsewhere includes used oil and old ammunition. A Berlin official said
yesterday that ecological damage left by Soviet troops in east Germany could
take billions of marks to clean up although a reliable study had yet to be
conducted.
Following German unification, the Soviet Union has agreed to withdraw
380,000 soldiers and their 220,000 family members from eastern Germany by
the end of 1994. Now, concerns about who pays for cleaning up the ecological
damage left behind have increased.
The weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel claims wastes have been poured on to the
ground or buried in military training areas controlled by the Soviets.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR NIKOLAI RYZHKOV, the former Soviet prime minister who stepped down last
year following a heart attack, is emerging as the hardline challenger to Mr
Boris Yeltsin for the Russian presidency.
Candidates for the presidency must register before May 21. Each must secure
either 100,000 supporting signatures, or the backing of at least a fifth of
the deputies in the Russian parliament.
The election will be held on June 12.
Mr Yeltsin is considered a clear favourite, but Mr Ryzhkov will gather
support from large numbers of people in the military, industry and the
bureaucracy who are worried by the economic crisis and to whom he offers
reassurance and order.
At the same time, both he and Mr Yeltsin are careful not to stray too far
away from the centre, as the centripetal forces of the first ever popular
election make themselves felt. Mr Yeltsin, who together with Mr Gorbachev
met leaders of the autonomous republics within Russia last Sunday, is doing
all he can to project the image of a man concerned for the future of the
country and working for stability in harness with the Soviet president.
Mr Ryzhkov, for his part, told the armed forces newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda
that he supported a 'moderately radical way' which would allow Russia to
'live better' and would revive it 'without breaking up the union . . . in a
peaceful, calm way with all positions duly taken into account'.
Mr Yeltsin's organisational base is in the Democratic Russia movement and
the independent unions, while Mr Ryzhkov has attracted the support of the
hardline Soyuz group of deputies and the Russian Communist party.
Both men will face other contenders. Mr Vadim Bakatin, a member of Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev's presidential council and a former interior minister, is
still hesitating over entering the lists, but is presenting himself as a
centrist candidate avoiding the 'extremes' of Mr Yeltsin and Mr Ryzhkov.
From the hard left, Mr Alexei Sergeev, an economist, has been nominated by
the United Workers Front, some of whose representatives carried pictures of
Stalin in Red Square during the May Day rally earlier this month.
On the radical side, Mr Aman Tuleev, chairman of Kemerovo regional soviet in
the heart of the radical miners' country, will stand on the ticket that Mr
Yeltsin has betrayed the radical cause by signing an agreement with Mr
Gorbachev to support the anti-crisis plan.
The first application for the post of presidency, however, has been filed by
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic party, a group
which has proclaimed itself as centrist and has until recently had a close
relationship both with the Communist party and the security forces.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Gorbachev targets key sectors of Soviet economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday signed a decree establishing a
'special regime' in key economic sectors. It was presented as offering
incentives to workers who raise their output, although Mr Valentin Pavlov,
the Soviet prime minister, last week described the plan in harsher terms. He
said it would allow the government to arrest and bring to trial those who
went on, or called for, a strike.
The independent news agency Interfax reported that the decree allowed
increased autonomy in such basic industries as mining, steel and chemical
production, transport and energy extraction. It would permit companies to
retain 10 per cent of income earned on domestic or foreign markets.
The decree appears to be modelled on the agreement with the mineworkers,
both in tying extra wages to extra production and in allowing enterprises to
distribute profits among the workforce.
At the same time, Mr Gorbachev's office has announced a clutch of new,
part-time presidential advisers of a moderately liberal (reformist
Communist) bent. They include Dr Leonid Abalkin, the economist, who was
deputy prime minister and head of economic reform until late last year.
The other advisers are Mr Vladimir Kudryavtsev, director of the Institute of
State and Law and a key shaper of legislation under Mr Gorbachev; Mr Vladen
Martynov, director of the Institute of World Economy and International
Relations, now a fairly radical think tank; Mr Yuri Osipian, a leading
physicist, vice president of the Academy of Science and already on the
presidential council; and Mr Boris Oleinik, a deputy chairman of the Soviet
of Nationalities in the Supreme Soviet and a poet.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S big banks have responded quickly to Sunday's one percentage point
cut in the discount rate to 11.5 per cent by lowering their rates to
borrowers and lenders. The move, which has been warmly welcomed by business,
should help mitigate some of the inflationary consequences of the indirect
tax increases agreed in Saturday's mini-budget.
It will also play an important part in lowering the financing costs on
Italy's huge government debt, and may help improve the lira's
competitiveness following complaints that it is overvalued. The lira fell to
L741.95 against the D-Mark yesterday, against Friday's L739.87.
Saturday's budget package, which imposed a L30,000 (Pounds 13.70) tax on
credit cards and a swingeing increase in the licence on four-wheel drive
vehicles, has been condemned as discriminatory by credit card companies and
some motor manufacturers.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Launch of Croat daily blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, East Europe Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH-FINANCED independent and liberal newspaper which was due to appear
today in the Yugoslav republic of Croatia was blocked from publication
yesterday when Vejsnik, the republic's largest newspaper group, prevented
its contracted printers from having any dealings with the new daily.
The move appears to confirm suspicions by foreign investors that the
republic remains reluctant to allow genuine competition, despite its
rhetoric about wanting to introduce privatisation and the market economy.
But the printing ban on Zapad ('West') could also hold wider political
implications for Yugoslavia's second largest republic.
A Croatian journalist, unconnected with either paper, said Zapad would have
broken the Croatian government's overbearing influence over the media 'by
telling the truth and by giving its readers a choice'.
Another commented: 'The move to block the paper's printing has political
overtones. I do not like to say this, but Mr Franjo Tudjman (the president
of Croatia) is waging a propaganda war against Serbia. His right-wing
government has little patience for any journalists who do not toe the
party's political line.'
Zapad, intended to have a circulation of more than 100,000, and modelled on
Spain's El Pais, is financed by Tricapital, a UK company which has
international interests in oil, property and energy, and Zapad Media, a
private company based in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia.
Mr Strock, the director of Zapad Media, retains the majority share,
Tricapital has a large minority share, and the remaining 10 per cent is held
by the 40 or so journalists. Mr Strock, who was born in Croatia, has lived
in the UK for the past 14 years.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Community and Efta reach broad agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community early today reached broad agreement on most of the
outstanding issues in extending its single market to the seven countries of
the European Free Trade Association (Efta).
Switzerland brought 12 hours of talks to the point of collapse by demanding
an individual right to opt out of future legislation governing the 19-nation
European Economic Area (EEA). But it eventually bowed to its Efta partners
and the EC in agreeing that any future exemptions would have to be
negotiated.
Efta countries won their key demand for their judges to sit alongside those
of the European Community's Court of Justice to interpret disputes under EEA
law.
The other main sticking point - Spain's demand for access to Icelandic
fishing waters in return for improved access for Efta fish products to the
EC - was finessed. Mr Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's foreign minister presiding
over the EC side, claimed 'a method' had been agreed for negotiators to
bridge the gap between Spain's demand for 90,000 tonnes a year of mainly
Icelandic fish and Iceland's refusal to make any concession at all.
The highly charged issue of free trade in fish has so far been one of the
biggest obstacles to agreement between the EC and Efta countries.
If the 18-month long negotiation between the two groupings is successfully
concluded as planned next month - and the EEA treaty ratified by all Efta
parliaments - Efta countries will start putting on their statute books some
1,400 pages of EC internal market legislation developed over the past 30
years.
Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, described the
negotiations as far more complex than individual Efta states joining the
Community outright.
The EEA required special institutional arrangements, allowing Efta states a
say, but not a vote, in the shaping of EC law and its interpretation,
without compromising the EC's formal decision-making machinery.
But inserted into the final communique was Switzerland's insistence that it
could only accept a final EEA treaty if it was 'global and balanced'.
The seven nations of Efta are Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Austria,
Switzerland and associate member Liechtenstein. A full accord with the EC
would create a 19-nation market of 380m consumers.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Share prices fall steeply on fears that base rate cut may be
delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN London were hit yesterday by fears that the government may keep
interest rates at their current levels this week, in spite of growing
concern about the seriousness of the recession.
Many companies feel that cuts in base rates, now at 12 per cent, will be
required if the UK economy is to recover later this year in line with
government expectations.
Treasury efforts yesterday to cool hopes of an imminent cut in rates
preceded a downturn in the FT-SE 100 index, which closed 37.7 lower at
2,486.6.
Trading was also affected by weakness on Wall Street - although the Dow
Jones Industrial Average finished in positive terrority, closing 4.25 up at
2,924.42 after a weak start - and disquiet among investors at the election
fever gripping both the main political parties.
In spite of government caution on interest rates, there is a growing belief
in the City that monetary policy will be eased soon after the weekend, if
there is no rate this week. However, Mr Norman Lamont remains worried by
lack of evidence that underlying inflation, particularly related to wages,
is coming down.
Data from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed that consumer
credit demand remained subdued in the first three months of the year, while
the volume of retail sales fell 0.6 per cent compared with the equivalent
period last year.
On the foreign exchanges, sterling remained firm. In London it rose 1.3
cents to Dollars 1.7320, and improved to DM2.9675 from DM2.9650, gaining
further in New York, to Dollars 1.734 and DM2.97295.
London money markets continued to discount a rate cut, with the three-month
sterling interbank rate quoted at 11 9/16 -11 1/2 per cent, against 11 9/16
 11 7/16 on Friday.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Poll points to big Labour victory in Monmouth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR IS heading for a sweeping victory in Thursday's by-election in
Monmouth, according to an opinion poll which gives the party an 8 percentage
point lead.
The poll will intensify pressure from Conservative MPs for another cut in
interest rates to ease the impact of the recession on the government's
supporters in the southern half of England.
In spite of the public reservations of the Treasury and the Bank of England,
some ministers expect a  1/2 percentage point reduction in base rates this
week. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is said to share their concern to
see an across-the-board reduction in mortgage rates.
On Friday figures are likely to show a sharp drop in the inflation rate last
month to about 6 per cent. That could provide an appropriate backdrop for
lower base rates.
Some senior Conservatives, however, would like an earlier announcement in
the hope of winning back wavering supporters in Monmouth, where the Tories
are defending a majority of 9,350.
Although Mr Major has now set his sights on autumn as the earliest possible
date for a general election, ministers believe it is vital the voters feel
the benefit of lower interest rates as quickly as possible.
With unemployment set to rise sharply over the next few months, the
government is basing its hopes of a strong electoral recovery on the
expectation that lower inflation and interest rates will boost the incomes
of those in work.
However, colleagues of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, acknowledge that he
would risk destabilising sterling's strong position on the European exchange
rate mechanism if he were seen by financial markets to be seeking to drive
down borrowing costs too quickly.
The Treasury yesterday sought to damp hopes of an imminent cut. Mr David
Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, told BBC radio that the government
would ease borrowing conditions only when prudent.
The poll in Monmouth, carried out by NOP for HTV Wales and The Independent
newspaper, gives Labour candidate Mr Huw Edwards 41 per cent, Tory candidate
Mr Roger Evans 33 per cent and Mrs Frances David, for the Liberal Democrats,
24 per cent. Mr Mel Witherden, the joint Green/Plaid Cymru candidate, polled
1 per cent.
Both Labour and the Tories were yesterday targeting Liberal Democrat voters
for the last few days of the campaign, and emphasising that the contest was
a straight fight between the two main parties.
'The situation remains as we have said all along,' said Tory campaigners.
'The choice for the people of Monmouth is clear: if they don't wish to be
represented by a socialist in parliament they must back Roger Evans on
Thursday.'
Mr Edwards called the figures 'very encouraging'. He issued an appeal to
Liberal Democrat supporters not to split the anti-Tory vote.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the by-election remained
'wide open', while arguing that the survey showed the Tories could not win.
'The choice for this constituency, and especially for traditional
Conservative voters, is now whether they want a Labour member of parliament
or a Liberal Democrat MP born and bred in Monmouth,' he said.
The party publishes its canvass returns this morning.
NOP interviewed 1,106 people across the constituency between last Thursday
and Sunday.

FT  14 MAY 91 / NatWest proposes market in small company shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank is considering setting up a market in small
company shares to rival the London stock exchange.
Its proposal is in response to the government's call for innovative ideas to
extend share ownership. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has invited
suggestions from the private sector on how to provide a cheap way for people
to use high street outlets to buy and sell shares.
In response to the Treasury's invitation, a project team from NatWest
Stockbrokers is developing ideas on how the bank could best offer an
'over-the-counter' market for shares in small companies.
The bank already provides instant share dealing in 550 companies through its
touch-screen service in 278 branches. Those screens could be equipped to
quote the prices of small companies at relatively little expense to the
bank, which could offer access to its market to the public as well as to its
own customers. Ministers believe the scheme could lead to a wider share
ownership. There are currently more than 11m individual shareholders,
compared with about 3m in 1979.
Mr Neil Stapley, managing director of NatWest Stockbrokers, said: 'We are
looking at setting up a separate market for small companies. I have been
looking at various ways of extending share ownership.'
Senior NatWest directors believe the proposal could be implemented by the
end of the summer, although it still has to be approved by the bank's board.
They believe a number of small companies, which are either unlisted or have
failed to find a home since the demise of the Third Market last year, would
welcome the opportunity of being quoted in a market run by the bank.
The directors see no need to get approval for their scheme from the stock
exchange because the bank is already regulated by The Securities and Futures
Authority (formerly The Securities Association).
The stock exchange, which has already set up a committee to look at the
general illiquidity in small companies, is unlikely to be keen on an
independent NatWest market.
Mr Andrew Hugh Smith, the stock exchange chairman, said: 'The banks are in a
position to offer a cheaper service than brokers. But I hope we would
provide sufficient value for them to do it in our market.'
NatWest directors are confident that ministers, anxious to widen share
ownership among individuals before the next election, would help push
through the proposal in the face of any stock exchange opposition.
The Treasury has made it clear than any proposal aimed at spreading share
ownership more widely, particularly through retail outlets, would be
welcomed.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Winnie Mandela found guilty of kidnapping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Winnie Mandela, wife of Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the
African National Congress (ANC), was convicted yesterday by a South African
court of kidnapping and being an accessory after the fact to four assaults.
Looking pale and stunned, 72-year-old Mr Mandela listened from the public
gallery as Mr Justice Michael Stegmann told the Rand Supreme Court in
Johannesburg that Mrs Mandela had 'showed herself on a number of occasions
to be a calm, composed, deliberate and unblushing liar'. Mr Mandela was
serving a life sentence for conspiring to overthrow the state when the
crimes took place.
Under South African law kidnapping is a capital offence, although Mrs
Mandela is certain to face a lesser punishment. Sentence will be announced
later today, after evidence in mitigation from the defence. Legal experts
familiar with the case said it seemed likely she would face a period in
jail.
Mr Justice Stegmann said he accepted Mrs Mandela's alibi, that she was on
her way to the town of Brandfort, over 180 miles away, when the kidnapping
and assaults took place. But he found that she and a co-accused, Mrs Xoliswa
Falati, had conspired to kidnap the four activists, including a 14-year-old
boy, Stompie Seipei, who was later found with his throat slit in a Soweto
ditch.
Mrs Mandela, he said, was one of the 'moving spirits' behind the kidnapping.
To imagine that it had taken place without her prior knowledge was like
imagining 'Hamlet without the Prince', he said. He further found Mrs Mandela
guilty of accessory after the fact to the crime of assault with intent to
commit grievous bodily harm against the four boys. This is a less serious
crime that than of the assault itself for which she was originally charged.
The four were seriously assaulted in an outside room at her Soweto home on
December 29 1988, leaving the walls of the room spattered with blood. She
was absent at the time, but on her return two days later, he found that she
must have known of or suspected the assaults and thus had 'assisted' and
'associated herself' with the attackers.
A radiantly smiling Mrs Mandela said outside the court: 'You can see how
delighted I am'.
Clipping her words short, and only barely suppressing her rage, she said:
'As long as you all now know that I did not assault any child, that's all
that matters to me. The rest I leave to my lawyers.'
Her reaction was in marked contrast to that of her husband, who stood by her
side looking grey with shock, his normally erect shoulders bowed beneath his
tightly belted overcoat. Mr Mandela's posture and deeply pained facial
expression raised fears about his health and ability to withstand the
distress of seeing his wife go to jail.
Mrs Mandela's conviction could further strain relations between the ANC, of
which she is a senior leader, and the government at a time when the two
sides are involved in tough negotiations over measures to end township
violence. The ANC has threatened to pull out of talks on the country's
political future unless Pretoria agrees to ban spears from public gatherings
by Thursday.

FOR all the hype over the past 20 years about how robots would transform
manufacturing industry, they still remain on the fringes of the industrial
scene - with the notable exception of manufacturing in Japan.
According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the world
industrial robot population stood at 388,000 units at the end of 1989, of
which 220,000 were in Japan, 56,000 in western Europe, 37,000 in the US and
 -very roughly - 75,000 elsewhere.
There are a number of interconnected reasons for this situation. In the
past, there has been considerable hostility from trade unions to their
introduction and managements have taken a lot of convincing about the cost
benefits.
Dr Kevin Clarke, manager of manufacturing engineering at PA Consulting
Group, says that, in many instances, robots have not delivered the cost
effectiveness they have promised. Robot manufacturers, he says, have not
developed their products technologically as fast as they might have.
'There's very little innovation, because the market isn't there,' he says.
However, the evidence of the past two years suggests that things may be
changing. Those 388,000 units represented an increase of 20 per cent from
the end of 1988, and in 1990 US-based robotics companies won record new
orders of Dollars 517.4m.
The robotics industry was in deep gloom during 1986 and 1987, and especially
in the US where it had become far too dependent on the motor industry -
which took about 40 to 50 per cent of sales.
Mr Donald Vincent, executive vice-president of the US Robotic Industries
Association, recalls that 'when the automotive industry quit buying in 1986
and 1987, it sent robotics into a deep spin.'
This decline had two results. First, it encouraged a much-needed
concentration among robot producers. In the middle of the 1980s there were
some 300, according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). Now,
it says, there are probably fewer than 100 true producers, led by ABB
Robotics, part of the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri, GMF Robotics, a joint
venture between Fanuc of Japan and General Motors of the US, and Yaskawa of
Japan.
Secondly, the downturn prompted an urgent search for new applications for
robots away from the motor industry and its inherent cyclicality. Dr Clarke
singles out 'clean room' applications for robots in health care and
precision engineering, while Mr Vincent is hopeful of new applications in
the food industry, materials handling and packaging.
The wellspring for this diversification into new markets, which has already
begun, is computer power. In mechanical terms, robots are relatively simple
beasts, and robotic technology has always been based on the use of computers
to overcome mechanical limitations.
Mr Kenneth Waldron, a robotics expert at Ohio State University, says 'the
major theme which will direct commercial applications of new research in
robotics will be that of taking advantage of the huge increases in computing
power which have become available as a result of the development of advanced
microprocessors.'
Mr Waldron notes that most current industrial robot systems offer only
incremental improvements over what was possible with the first generation of
microcomputer controllers.
Current research is looking at areas such as greater use of sensing - of the
robot's environment and internal state - more sophisticated control
techniques offering greater speed and accuracy, robotic mobility and
improved control of the interface between the robot and the workpiece.
Given these trends, there has inevitably been considerable interest in
industrial vision systems for robots, which could radically change many
applications, particularly in assembly where robots have so far failed to
make their mark.
Previous forecasts for the population of vision-equipped robots have not
been realised, but it is reasonable to predict, as the IFR has, that the
continuous reduction in prices of computers and sensors, and their greater
speed and reliability, will gradually remove the technological and economic
barriers.
Many of the business trends in robotics over the past few years are
illustrated by developments at ABB Robotics, which claims to be the world's
biggest supplier - a title which the Japanese manufacturers might dispute.
ABB's purchase last year of Cincinnati Milacron's robotics business was an
important step in the consolidation of the industry around leading European
and Japanese suppliers. Mr Stelio Demark, head of ABB Robotics, says the
Cincinnati business brought with it a tremendous US customer base and
undoubted expertise in spot-welding robotics.
The nature of ABB's customer base has also been changing, and over the past
five years it has reduced its dependence on the automotive industry from
70-75 per cent of sales to 50 per cent. ABB is attracting new business from
small and medium-sized companies which had previously not bought robots. 'We
may be supplying ones and twos, but it's growing very quickly,' says Mr
Demark.
New markets include glass making, different kinds of process applications,
and palletising. This effort is backed up by spending on research and
development - 10 per cent of revenues - that is almost on a par with that of
the pharmaceutical industry.
Meanwhile the falling cost of electronics is allowing ABB to build more
capability and flexibility into its robots. ABB's latest product, the IRB
6000, was officially launched last month with claims of much greater
flexibility and capability than rival products.
Because of these developments, Mr Demark is optimistic about future growth
prospects for ABB and the industry. The view is shared by independent
observers.
In a report about to be published by Frost &amp; Sullivan, the international
market research publishers, total world robot sales are forecast to rise
from Dollars 2.15bn in 1990 to Dollars 3.41bn in 1996. The relatively small
size of the industry at the end of the 1980s is a reflection of many of the
factors mentioned above.
F &amp; S sees the Japanese market's share of world robot sales falling from 65
per cent last year to 45 per cent in 1996, while Europe's share will rise
from 15 to 20 per cent, the US will mark time at about 6 per cent and the
rest of the world will jump from 14 per cent to just under 30 per cent.
The biggest growth area is Asia, which is good news for the Japanese
producers, but Europe, says Mr Demark, is also 'very interesting,' and the
company's home base. F &amp; S sees the European market rising from Dollars 330m
in 1990 to Dollars 687m in 1996, with Germany leading the way.
Looking specifically at the European market, F &amp; S comments that the
'supplier capable of marketing a complete package including sensors,
user-friendly software and simple training and installation will achieve the
best sales penetration.'
ABB is probably justified in claiming that it offers more service and
support to European buyers than the more product-based approach of the
Japanese, but Dr Clarke wonders whether this will still be true in two
years' time. On the other hand Europe, he says, is probably not one of the
Japanese producers' priorities, given the better growth prospects in the
Asia Pacific region.
As for the balance of power in the industry, both ABB and the Japanese are
growing stronger, the big producers are getting bigger, and the smaller
robotics companies, particularly in the US and UK, are concentrating on
niches and ancillary services.
If the big producers can keep up with development in computing, the 1990s
could well bring the rewards that proved so elusive for much fo the 1980s.

of one - Simultaneous Engineering

THE time taken to design and manufacture a new product could be reduced
substantially if both operations were carried out together, instead of one
after the other as was the almost unavoidable practice in traditional
engineering before the widespread use of computer power.
Working out how to make a product in a mass production process at the same
time as the product is designed is the essence of simultaneous, concurrent
or integrated engineering, the various descriptions given to an emerging
approach to engineering where everything is done at once.
This may seem impossible. Yet computers have made it possible for work to
proceed on the design of a product at the same time as on the ways of making
the product.
With simultaneous engineering, the design of a new product takes account of
how it will be made, so that the easiest, most economic way to make the
product is chosen and is feasible.
Traditionally, if a design made it difficult for a company to manufacture
and mass produce the product as designed, then the design was modified until
the manufacturing difficulty was overcome.
The essence of simultaneous, or concurrent engineering is that account is
taken of the manufacturing process as the design proceeds, so avoiding
redesign at a late stage in the development of a product and its
manufacturing process.
An illustration of the importance of simultaneous engineering is the way new
products are designed using new materials, such as the advanced ceramic
materials that are being developed for jet engines.
These materials have distinct advantages over the metals traditionally used
for these applications, but in order for manufacturers to exploit these
advantages to the utmost, they have to take account of how these materials
will behave when they are used in production processes.
In other words, the production process has to be developed hand in hand with
the design of the product.
The only way to do this is through simultaneous engineering.
Mr James Angus, the team leader at the Rolls-Royce Advanced Ceramics Centre
at Warwick University, where integrated engineering techniques are being
developed for future jet engine components, says the integration of design
engineering, materials science and manufacturing technology is essential for
the new ceramic materials because, for the first time with any material, the
designer has the opportunity to design the material to suit exactly the
properties needed in a component.
This unusual way of designing a product or component has to take account of
the way the product will be manufactured and mass produced and vice versa,
otherwise the carefully tailored material properties of the component could
be lost.
Ms Sue Lyons, the director of manufacturing engineering at Rolls-Royce, says
'we are moving towards completely integrated or concurrent engineering
across the company.'
The integrated programme is being finalised and all technology groups, such
as stress and mechanical engineers and manufacturing specialists will come
together at the conceptual design stage of a new product.
Ms Lyons says 'the division between design and manufacturing could disappear
altogether.'
The change to integrated engineering is crucial because of the high
proportion of a product's cost that is set at the design stage.
In the case of a jet engine as much as 80 per cent of the cost of a new
product for the engine is fixed at the design stage. The aim is to reduce
this fixed cost element in a product by designing it so that it is easy to
manufacture.
It is possible to influence significantly the final cost of a product,
including its manufacturing cost, by the addition of only very little extra
cost at the design stage.
Mr Robin Blake, of Rolls-Royce says that 'concurrent engineering is not an
alternative for consideration, it is an absolute necessity. The demands to
reduce lead time and cost can only be met by teamwork in a concurrent
engineering environment.'
Computer systems available to handle concurrent engineering include systems
from Intergraph, one of the world's largest companies developing and
manufacturing interactive computer graphics for computer aided engineering.
Intergraph won an order last year, potentially worth Dollars 40m, from the
US Sandia National Laboratories for systems with a concurrent engineering
capability. The agreement called on Intergraph to supply hardware and
software for the Nirvana project, the code name for the Sandia National
Laboratories/US Department of Energy programme to implement a computer aided
design and manufacturing system with a concurrent engineering capability.
Nirvana was designed to help Sandia, which is the US Department of Energy
prime contractor for nuclear research, and its sub-contractors to move from
using multi-vendor, non-integrated solutions to particular problems to a
more efficient integrated approach.
In the first year of the agreement, Intergraph will supply a range of
engineering design software tools and about 140 of its Risc-based UNIX
workstations. The hardware and software will be used to integrate and
improve the design, manufacture and assembly of complex electronics-based
products.
These tools will operate under a common user framework. Product design
information will flow from initial system design, through sub-system design,
the design of printed circuit boards, hybrid and integrated circuit design
through mechanical design and on to manufacturing, including document
publishing.
Additional data is to be added to the design definition at each step and
design data from preceding steps will not need to be re-entered.
Mr Dick Fox, the UK marketing director of Intergraph says the result will be
high quality products designed and manufactured in a shorter period of time
than would otherwise be possible, one of the objects of concurrent
engineering.

the factories - Shop-Floor Systems, demand continues to grow
</HEADLINE>

ALMOST every type of computer hardware that exists in a commercial data
processing department can be found somewhere in a manufacturing environment.
The basic electronics of manufacturing technology is the same as in the rest
of the business world; it is the fine-tuning which is different.
Large manufacturers typically depend on a mainframe for their central
corporate functions and this is likely to continue.
Though most want to make more information available to users by introducing
distributed systems and client/server architectures, the need for the
biggest companies to consolidate and store large volumes of data will
probably persist. Only a mainframe can cope with that load.
Moreover, the spread of ED1 (electronic data interchange, or paperless
trading) could slow or even reverse the erosion of the role of the
mainframe.
However, as mainframes are no longer cheaper to run than smaller boxes,
manufacturing applications such as MRP systems have been steadily moving,
through a process of downsizing, from mainframes to mid-range machines or
even networks of personal computers.
The general change of management strategy in manufacturing, from central
control to local responsibility - the so-called cellular concept - favours
the spread of mid-range machines or PCs rather than mainframes.
In the past decade computing has brought great changes to the management of
manufacturing through MRP systems, but it has only just begun to make an
impact on the shop-floor.
Most shop-floors receive an action list as output from the MRP system and
that is as far as the computer stretches. The advent of the just-in-time
manufacturing philosophy has persuaded many companies that the computer has
to be introduced on the shop-floor to support the production process.
Shop-floor data collection is usually handled by a mid-range machine,
although PCs are replacing mid-range machines in some sites.
Mid-range open systems hardware based on the UNIX operating system is
beginning to be used in factories where the ability to integrate systems
from different manufacturers is essential.
Personal computers have changed the life of factories, if rather slower than
that of offices.
As factories get cleaner, standard PCs can be used in more and more places.
It is now often quite appropriate for an ordinary PC to be in a foreman's
office.
Tens of thousands of PCs, mainly IBM or clones, are scattered around British
factories. On the design side, workstations from companies such as Sun
Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard are the standard tools of the trade.
Where life is too rough for the standard PC, ruggedised machines are used.
In some cases robust terminals can be put on the shop-floor with the main
computing facility kept in a back office or, for that matter, in another
town or country. Local computing power is usually needed for many
applications that involve graphics or diagrams. For these the machine has to
be on site because the telecommunications system cannot transmit high
volumes of data over any great distance.
Specially adapted equipment or protective packaging may be needed in the
factory for many reasons, as Mr Graham Crocker, a manufacturing specialist
at IBM, points out. It may be dirty, the temperature may vary from very hot
to very cold, there may be vibration or disruption of the electricity
supply.
There may be risk of fire or liquid being spilled or worker's hands may be
greasy. There may be electromagnetic interference from other machines,
requiring computers to be kept in steel cases.
Shop-floor workers may be less familiar with computer systems than office
workers; special keyboards with function keys may be preferable to the
conventional Qwerty layout.
On the shop-floor small ruggedised hand-held computers from companies such
as Coventry-based Husky are being adopted by some large companies both for
data collection and for quality control.
At the Royal Doulton china factories, for example, Huskys are used to keep
track of the 40,000 types of product.
Hand-held and laptop machines have grown in popularity as they have got
lighter and their screens have become easier to read. At the same time they
have been enhanced by being able to store more data and to run longer before
the battery needs changing.
The principal requirement of the manufacturer which differs from that of the
commercial user is a high degree of hardware availability.
Reliability is one aspect of availability. Mr Richard Ridler, manufacturing
industry marketing manager for ICL, points out that whereas some office
systems can go down for 10 or 20 minutes occasionally without causing
anything worse than annoyance, in a factory this could be disastrous.
Mr Graham McKenzie, manufacturing systems manager with Digital, identifies
three levels of resilience.
Digital VAXes can be clustered so that if a disk drive fails on one recovery
can be achieved within a few minutes. Two machines can be connected within a
single cabinet so that if one goes down the other will pick up the task
within a few seconds. Or three machines can be tightly coupled so that if
one of them fails the process will carry on uninterrupted and unnoticed by
the user; this is normally called fault-tolerance.
Response time is another aspect of availability. Industrial users expect
subsecond response times for many functions, where office users could be
asked to be more patient.
A third factor is the working regime. Office systems are typically shut down
to users overnight and at weekends, whereas factory systems may have to work
a 24-hour day and about 360 days a year. It is therefore important for the
manufacturer to decide what level of availability is needed for his systems
before investing in hardware. Continuous uptime can be achieved, but the
price goes up as availability is increased.
Prospects for systems suppliers to manufacturers in the longer term must be
rated as good.
The negative signs are that, as in the office market, users are expecting to
pay less for more all the time and the market for MRP systems shows some
signs of saturation. Only the smaller factories do not have these systems
and they may either have no pressing need or no money to invest.
On the positive side the pressure of competition is making manufacturers
concentrate more on the need for automation, especially on the shop-floor.
Large manufacturers are getting stricter with their suppliers on quality,
forcing those companies to invest more in technology. Finally, the
technology itself is clearly becoming ever more capable of delivering real
benefits.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (10): Useful systems
for the well-connected - Manufacturing Software, the complexity of the
applications requires careful co-ordination
</HEADLINE>

SOFTWARE to control manufacturing is among the most complex of commercial
applications. In its most sophisticated form it entails connections between
customers, suppliers, accounting, warehousing and the shop-floor. Its
implementation must therefore be carefully co-ordinated.
In the 1960s, IBM, among others, recognising that manufactured products
could be progressively 'exploded' into a bill of materials, realised how
useful a computer could be in estimating the raw material quantities
required to make up finished goods. These databases, originally held on
punched cards, evolved rapidly. The data handling needs of Bill of Materials
Processing (Bomp), led software designers to create hierarchical databases,
from which products such as IBM's IMS
Early systems provided data for Materials Requirements Planning (MRP).
Take a manufactured item, reduce it into sub assemblies, then explode those
progressively until you have raw materials, multiply the numbers by the
overall quantity of finished goods needed, and you have an estimate of
overall requirements.
Ally that to a manufacturing schedule - showing which parts are needed when
 -and you have a planning system from which you can order goods.
Such systems were very useful for manufacturing goods made up of discrete
parts. However, for process applications - production of paint, foods or
other products - the process is not so simple. The number of a certain type
of switch or body panel needed to make a car does not vary. You may have
some wastage in small items such as nuts and bolts, but the quantities used
are still discrete. In continuous process manufacturing you must rely more
on statistics than precise figures. You are not producing one product at a
time, but a continuous stream of the product. The principles may seem
similar, but the practice is more complex.
A consideration common to both discrete and continuous process manufacturing
can be batch control. You may need to track a batch of finished goods from
its components, through to its eventual customers.
When a batch of yoghurt was found to contain botulism the manufacturers had
to be able to say precisely where the tainted goods had gone, and then go
back and identify the raw material responsible to find out which other goods
might be similarly affected. As a result, they were able to focus their
warnings on a particular set of hazelnut flavour products. Inability to
track products in this way would lead to the wholesale withdrawal of a
product line, with disastrous consequences for the manufacturer's profits.
The production planning process involves ensuring that enough goods are
produced to meet forward orders for a period, without running out or
becoming overstocked. The effect of this flows back to the beginning of the
process. You must take delivery of enough raw materials to ensure that your
production lines do not stop for the want of a component, but that your
parts inventory does not overwhelm your storage and financial resources.
Moreover, your suppliers must be able to schedule their production processes
to ensure that you are supplied with goods at the right time and in the
right quantity.
The first MRP systems did not cater for this requirement. They were able to
extrapolate need based on orders and schedules. Purchasing managers had to
ensure that the correct quantities were ordered at the correct time.
With MRP II systems, the interface between the outside world - suppliers and
customers - and the manufacturing system is automated. The system is driven
by sales order processing. Customers' future ordering requirements are
entered into the system. These are exploded into component parts, and a
schedule of raw materials is built up. At this time the system may be
dealing with estimates in the form of future ordering requirements from
component suppliers. From these will be generated similar forecasts all the
way back to the suppliers of the basic raw products.
Once the sales order becomes firm, the manufacturer can call off goods from
his suppliers, based on the schedule - with whatever variations might be
needed to suit actual needs.
If the MRP system is sufficiently advanced, all this can be automated. Sales
orders, once input, can automatically drive the whole process. Using
electronic document interchange (EDI) no further human intervention should
be needed after the input of a customer order. All intermediate
documentation right down the chain of suppliers can be automatically
produced.
The need for standards for data interchange is obvious, and there are a
number in use. In the motor industry there is Odette, other standards
include ANSI X12 and Edufact. These define the form and contents of
documents and electronic packages.
Some suppliers of manufacturing software, such as Istel, a subsidiary of A T
&amp; T, point to the importance of the open systems movement. However,
according to Mr Alan Topliss, of Price Waterhouse, their robustness,
security and ability to handle the very large amounts of data needed, are
still not considered sufficient by many users.
The most advanced use of MRP, mainly for companies producing in relatively
low numbers is Just In Time (Jit) manufacturing. The idea is to produce
goods only when they are needed - rather than stockpiling them. The
ramifications flow right back down the chain. You must be able to call off
ordered parts from your suppliers in the same fashion. A motor manufacturer,
for example, may only keep a small stock of wheels - perhaps two hours'
supply. In these circumstances, you need not only to forecast your numbers,
but also how long it will take to deliver them.
It is logical to drive shop floor control systems from MRP. However, as Mr
Tony Baggot of EDS points out, you need a competent 'systems integrator' who
understands how to link together all the disparate components. 'It's not
just a matter of connecting machines up, they must share the same protocols'
he stresses.
The automation of manufacturing is an area in which not only machines, but
also the operations of companies become interlinked. The benefits are
obvious, but the complexity calls for careful adherence to standards.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (7): Academia and
industry forge tighter links - Research &amp; Development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILL Hillier joined the Science and Engineering Research Council (Serc) six
years ago 'to see if I could help to get academia to work with industry'. He
moved from industry, Racal Redac, where he worked on computer-aided design,
to become the co-ordinator of the Acme research programme at the Serc's
headquarters in Swindon.
Acme stands for Applications of Computers in Manufacturing. Serc invests
about Pounds 7m a year through Acme in projects in universities and
polytechnics in Britain. These projects cover the whole range of computing
in manufacturing, from work on the control of robots, for example, through
computer-aided design to production management.
Mr Hillier says 'Acme activities emphasise research at universities into
real problems that are industrially relevant.' The R &amp; D is not, though,
day-to-day trouble shooting. Industry does not expect academia researchers
to provide immediate answers to short-term problems. Mr Hillier says that
Acme hopes to support research that will deliver useful results within two
to five years.
In all, Acme supports something like 135 projects. These range from small
grants for visiting fellowship to large clubs with industry. The largest
grants are for about Pounds 350,000 for three years.
Serc launched the Acme programme six years ago. Since then it has awarded
grants worth a total that is approaching Pounds 40m. The work, on about 400
projects, is in four main areas; advanced production machines,
computer-aided engineering, manufacturing processes, and planning and
management.
In each Acme project, the Serc expects academic institutions to work closely
with industrial partners. Industry may contribute financially to a project -
it adds an average 15 per cent to the Serc's contribution - but in many
cases, industry's contribution is not so much financial as in time and other
resources. For example, companies sometimes provide materials for processing
in university projects.
Acme's projects cover a wide range of industries. For example, the Control
and Robotics Group, part of the Department of Electronic Engineering at the
university of Hull, is involved in several projects with the shoe and
garment industries. The aim of this research is to develop automated
manufacturing processes.
In one research project at Hull, the group is developing a robotic work cell
to assemble complete garments, in this case underpants. Each cell would have
seven or eight machines performing a particular task on a garment before
passing it on to the next stage.
In the cell, robot vision system would recognise the parts and tell the
machines what to do with them. A big problem with textiles is that the parts
are flexible. This makes it difficult for an optical system to recognise the
shape. 'Pick up a dishcloth and it doesn't look like a rectangle at all,'
says Dr Gaynor Taylor, a researcher in the group.
The industrial collaborator is Corah, a garment manufacturer that supplies
Marks and Spencer. The ultimate aim of this work is to develop a production
cell that can receive cut parts at one end and deliver finished garments
from the other. In their research, the Hull group analyses the production
process a step at a time.
Another series of projects brings together researchers from the universities
of Durham and Hull. Their industrial collaborator is British United Shoe
Machinery (BUSM).
Here the step-by-step approach is even more important because companies
making shoes are not accustomed to investing large amounts in machinery. So
the projects set out to automate individual steps of shoe production, with a
particular emphasis on preparing the parts and sewing them together before
they go on the final manufacturing stages.
The aim of the project is not to develop prototype machines, says Mr Taylor.
It is up to the machinery makers to develop commercial equipment.
The research at Durham and Hull has concentrated on the use of electronic
vision and image recognition equipment and other technologies to develop
manufacturing and handling processes that do not have to be altered every
time a company changes the style of the shoes that it is making.
Mr David Reedman is on the receiving end of this research. He is manager of
research for BUSM. 'Universities and polytechnics are very good at research
but not at product development,' he says.
Mr Reedman believes that projects with academic researchers can tell a
manufacturer if a particular piece of technology will work in its industry.
'I ask 'Can I use this technology in Shoe making?'' he says. 'A research
project which establishes quickly and efficiently that a new technology is
unsuitable is just as successful, if not as acceptable, as one with a more
positive outcome.'
'What you get out of the university research is usually a model that
demonstrates some principle,' says Mr Reedman. It is then down to
development engineers to turn the idea into commercial products. Earlier
this month at a trade show in Germany, BUSM showed a prototype shoe
stitching machine based on its work with the university research teams.
Over the past five years, BUSM has benefited from grants totalling almost
Pounds 450,000 for work at the two universities. 'I don't see how we can
survive without the research,' says Mr Reedman.
Acme supports a range of projects in the general area of computer aided
design. Dr Bob Cripps at the university of Birmingham, works on the computer
modelling of surfaces and how they behave in various manufacturing
processes. One such project involved collaboration with Austin Rover on a
phenomenon know as springback.
When a piece of flat steel is pressed into a complex shape, a car bonnet for
example, it takes up the exact shape of the press. But remove the pressure
and the shape changes slightly. In the past, getting the right shape was
more a black art than a science, according to Dr Bob Cripps who worked on
the project.
The Birmingham team computerised the whole process of design manufacture of
complex components in an attempt to understand the phenomenon of springback.
The idea was to be able to predict exactly how much of a change in shape a
component would experience as it came out of a press.
The work at Birmingham achieved its goal, the researchers could predict the
amount of springback that would occur. However, in the process of
computerising the manufacturing process, the problem of springback lessened.
Another task facing manufacturers is to move products around in factories.
In another Acme project, Professor Mike Brady of Oxford University has
developed an automatic sensing system that can guide an unmanned vehicle
around a factory.
This Pounds 250,000 project, with four industrial collaborators including
GEC and Thorn-EMI, has resulted in the development of a vehicle equipped
with a laser-rangefinder and ultrasonic position detection. Sensors feed
information into an on-board computer that can then pick a route around
unexpected obstacles.
Computerised hardware is an essential part of any manufacturing system.
There are, however, other issues facing the manufacturer who wants to
introduce new technology. This too is an area for academic research. Mr Mike
Gregory is pioneering a new area of research - for academia at least.
There is nothing new about research on the technology of manufacturing,
engineering departments have been doing it since their beginnings.
Researchers have also studied the social impacts of new manufacturing
technology on the workplace, but they have yet to look seriously at the
management of manufacturing.
Mr Gregory believes that before a company can develop a manufacturing
strategy, it needs to undertake a manufacturing audit. Companies need to
design manufacturing systems that meet their business requirements. To
achieve this, he says, 'We need more research into the interface between
organisations and technology'.
More research is only of value if the results reach industry. Mr Gregory's
work has led to a booklet called Competitive Manufacturing, that is
published by the Department of Trade and Industry. There are, though, gaps
in the flow of information from R &amp; D on computers in manufacturing.
The government's Advisory Council on Science and Technology (Acost)
highlighted these gaps in its recent report called Advanced Manufacturing
Technology. The report drew attention to the lack of co-ordination in the
various activities in advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). 'The
aggregation of the dispersed knowledge of AMT in the UK, both industrial and
academic, together with the acquisition of international experience, can
offer individual companies a valuable new resource,' says the report.
Professor Lionel Maunder of the university of Newcastle, chairman of Acost's
Engineering Technologies Committee, hopes that this report will lead to the
creation of local centres where industry can seek information on advanced
manufacturing technologies. It has prompted the DTI to enter into discussion
with the Science and Engineering Research Council on the issue.
Unfortunately, the Acme programme has been hit by the shortage of funds
facing the Serc. The programme has to find savings of some 15 per cent. This
will inevitably put pressure on the DTI's own R &amp; D programmes.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (8): Paperless trading
offers single market opportunities - EDI, the switch gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING companies have identified EDI (electronic data interchange, or
paperless trading) as potentially one of their most effective weapons in the
battle for survival.
Hundreds of British manufacturing companies are beginning to feel the
benefits of cutting out bureaucracy and dealing via computer to place
orders, send invoices and make payments.
Some British manufacturers believe that they could derive significant
advantages from EDI when the single European market is fully operational.
The UK is well advanced in EDI compared to other European countries because
of the development of standards by the Article Number Association and the
Simpler Trading Procedures Board and because of value-added network services
created in the wake of telecommunications deregulation.
The ANA developed Tradacoms, the UK standard for trading communications, in
1982. This gave birth to services such as Tradanet offered by International
Network Services (INS), the EDI supplier co-owned by ICL and General
Electric Information Services of the US. About 1,500 UK manufacturers do
business via Tradanet.
As companies search for ways of improving their business operations, they
have realised that many changes will be dependent on direct
computer-to-computer links with their suppliers and customers.
In particular, Jit (just in time manufacturing, a manufacturing philosophy
which has spread from Japan across the world in the past 10 years) can only
work properly on an EDI infrastructure.
This represents a considerable change of attitude from the early days of
EDI, when it was seen simply as a cost-cutting technique. Now the emphasis
has moved from saving money to providing a better service to customers
through swifter response to demand and more competitive prices.
Supply chain management is the centre of attention. Members of the supply
chain comprise what has been called a virtual organisation.
This involves a new way of thinking about the whole production process.
For example, in a virtual organisation it is possible to cut out duplication
of quality assurance.
Components which have been rigorously tested by the maker to his customer's
standards are not re-tested on arrival at the customer but go directly into
stock or, better still, straight into production.
When component makers receive their orders and confirm delivery
electronically, production scheduling can be more tightly controlled. The
result can be shrinking lead times and stock is sharply reduced or
eliminated.
Not surprisingly, the vanguard of EDI users is to be found in sectors which
are technologically-oriented. The electronics business began the switch in
1987.
Leaders in that field, such as ICL, have progressed in the last three years
to using EDI on an international scale to deal with component suppliers in
the US and continental Europe.
NCR uses EDI to exchange forecast demands regularly with its trading
partners in a Jit environment. Texas Instruments makes a point of its EDI
capability in its marketing slogan which insists it is 'better to do
business with'.
Telecommunications manufacturers are becoming keen EDI adherents. Mitel, the
Canadian private branch exchange (PBX) maker which is 51 per cent owned by
British Telecom, is in the process of converting.
It expects to have over 30 of its suppliers communicating via computer by
the end of the year for purchase orders. This will be followed by accepting
invoices from suppliers electronically and then by paying them through the
BACS banking network.
Mr Jeremy Arnold, Mitel's EDI co-ordinator says that although cost-saving is
important the main aim is to establish better long-term partnerships and cut
lead times in production.
The automotive sector is another which is taking up EDI rapidly, led by
leading manufacturers including Rover, Peugeot-Talbot, Citroen and Renault.
This sector, like others, has its own EDI user support group, called Odette,
which is active in eight European countries and is run in the UK by the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
According to Ms Kerry Shipley, its project manager, there are over 400 EDI
user companies in the automotive business in the UK.
This represents a high proportion of the leading companies but she notes
that their use of EDI is still restricted to a few functions such as
invoicing and delivery instructions.
She expects to see a steady expansion in the number of types of message sent
between members in the next five years.
At the same time there may be a second wave of recruits to Odette as many
smaller companies will be compelled by their larger customers to take up
EDI.
The big companies are not officially making EDI mandatory for their trading
partners, but they are stressing that an EDI capability is one of the
criteria for becoming a preferred supplier.
Other EDI user groups serving specific sectors include Cefic for chemical
companies and Edifice for electronics companies.
Aerospace is another area in which large manufacturers are driving EDI down
to small suppliers.
British Aerospace, for example, keen to adopt a Jit approach, has begun
using EDI not just with its production partners but with suppliers of other
goods and services too.
The laggard in EDI is still government.
Manufacturers which supply ministries and local authorities are still
generally unable to communicate with them electronically.
However, even in this area there are signs of movement; the number of
suppliers dealing electronically with the National Health Service has risen
to over 250.
Mr Patrick Tonks, marketing manager for INS, says that large companies have
been putting a lot of effort into winning over their trading partners to the
EDI method.
Rather than simply imposing a rule that all business with them must be done
electronically in future, they are holding seminars to persuade them of the
benefits of the new systems.
In the long term there is little doubt that any large or medium-sized
company in manufacturing must go over to EDI.
How long it will take is uncertain, but the trend is certainly accelerating;
and it is one of the bright spots of the computer industry which must give
it hope in its present time of crisis.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (6): Fuzzy logic and
robots spell technological advantage - Japan, modifying production
philosophies as emphasis shifts back to the human workforce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT seemed laughable at the time: a couple years ago a Japanese manufacturer
replaced some factory line workers with automation machinery, then set up
full-sized cardboard human dummies to keep the remaining workers from
getting lonely.
The completely workerless factory is a decade away, but there are a few
showcase examples including Fanuc, the machine tool manufacturer's factory
near Mount Fuji, where robots make robots. But until no-human factories are
realised on a broad scale, factory automation system makers will focus their
research on bridging the awkward interaction between humans and the ever
increasing number of machines working by their side.
In past years manufacturers put the emphasis on installing labour-saving
machines to raise production. They focused on maximising the use of people,
money, time and materials, and humans had to find a way to fit in with the
complex machinery beginning to surround them.
'Until now humans have had to adapt to use machines, so the man-machine
interface was not well matched,' says Mr Hiroshi Matsuyama, a manager at
Omron the programmable controller maker in Tokyo.
'Japanese industry is now modifying its philosophy. The centre of production
has shifted to human workers, and computers should be matched with humans,'
he says. That means designing new software that allows production machinery
to be more easily used and changed quickly for different jobs. For example,
welding or insertion and using artificial intelligence techniques such as
fuzzy logic to help robots and computers make better decisions, such as
finding an operational failure, through inferences, as humans do.
The escalating skilled labour shortage, brought about by a declining birth
rate and a more affluent and highly educated society, makes robots an
important component of factory automation, a do-or-die decision for some
companies.
Strong competition in industries such as shipping has resulted in waves of
investment in labour-saving technology such as steel and aluminium cutting
tools, processing machines and welding robots. The rise in the labour force
is expected to be 0.8 per cent a year until 1993, then it is likely to fall
off by half to 0.4 per cent until 2000, according to Japanese government
statistics. During that time Japan expects to keep about a 4 per cent annual
economic growth rate.
'To achieve this it is necessary to introduce automation technology,' says
Mr Kanji Yonemoto, vice-chairman of the Japan Industrial Robot Association
(Jira) in Tokyo. An even more remarkable shift in Japan's economy is the
switch from a manufacturing to a service economy.
Jobs in services pay better. Mr Yonemoto says there will be 1.5m fewer
blue-collar workers in manufacturing by 2000 than in 1989, when there was a
shortage of 715,800 people. Today's young people are a different breed of
worker from those who laboured long hours for little pay to build Japan's
industrial miracle.
They want to avoid so-called '3K' work: 'kiken' (dangerous), 'kitanai'
(dirty) and 'kitsui' (hard). 'Older men were very patient and had the
Bushido (warrior) morale, but it is hard to find these people today,' says
Mr Matsuyama.
Replacing them with machinery takes time and money. Omron, which produces
programmable controllers and other electronics products, sees the
improvements that can be made in factory automation as almost limitless and
including diagnosing system failures and other management tasks.
The improvements span a broad factory automation market valued at almost
Y2,000bn and covering every aspect of making a product from design through
production and inspection. The important components of automating a factory
are numerical controllers, the largest chunk of the market, as well as
computer-aided design and manufacturing software and equipment, industrial
robots, programmable controllers, automated warehouses, computers and
automatic guided vehicles that transport products throughout a plant site.
Japan leads the world in both producing and using these production
components. It has replaced Germany as the biggest exporter of machine
tools, an important indicator of industrial development and economic power.
Japan has an estimated 23 per cent of the world market compared to the 16
per cent held by Germany.
Five Japanese companies are making machine tools in Europe. Mazak Yamazaki,
for example, has a Dollars 50m factory in Worcester, in the UK which
produces some 100 computer-controlled machines a month, according to
industry estimates. Japan's worldwide share of the fast-growing robot market
is even more impressive: it has 57.5 per cent of the robot installations
worldwide, with western Europe having 14.5 per cent and the US 9.5 per cent.
Japan's main advantages are that workers in automotive, electronics and
other factories are accustomed to and readily accept automation technology,
product demand is still strong in the home market, and Japanese
manufacturers make most of the machines they use for automation, so there is
little competition from imports.
The electronics industry is the biggest user of automation technology. At
its Ome design and manufacturing works west of Tokyo, Toshiba uses its own
laptop computers for design, development and assembly of new Toshiba
laptops.
The laptops are used to compute how easily a new computer model can be
assembled by a line of 12 workers, who can slap together one notebook-size
Dynabook computer in a few minutes. That's important, because the company is
making about 1m laptops a year at Ome, and the life span of each new product
is getting increasingly shorter amid hot competition.
'Often it's the case with some products that the effective life span is
already over by the time it goes to the market place,' says Mr Masao Suga,
who heads the personal computer research and development department at Ome.
However, the shortening product life spans, which run from six months for a
Japanese word processor to about three years for laptops, made it
increasingly difficult for Toshiba to continue using robots. Toshiba
replicates about 70 per cent of design work from current models in new ones.
While it took Toshiba three years to develop the T3100 and J3100 laptops
from scratch, it took only nine months to design the smaller-size Dynabook.
Though its factory is about 70-80 per cent automated, visitors to the
company often comment about the number of people still present on the
manufacturing lines, but Mr Suga says that with the fast-paced product life
cycles, humans are needed. 'There are problems with automated systems. They
can't catch up with new technology, so humans are acting as universal super
robots,' he adds.
Fuzzy logic may help close the gap. Mr Yonemoto of Jira says fuzzy logic,
software that can help make a decision from unclear information, will help
increase the versatility of robots in the future by affording better control
of their movements. Omron, a leader in using fuzzy technology, has developed
a test robot that can grasp soft or fragile items, such as tofu (bean curd).
In a New Year's address to employees, Mr Yoshio Tateisi, company president,
identified fuzzy logic as an important research area for the 1990s. By 1994,
more than 20 per cent of Omron's product line will include some type of
fuzzy logic. According to Mr Matsuyama, fuzzy logic has many benefits. As
part of a computer-integrated manufacturing (Cim) system it can be used in
production and in managing the company.
'Another merit of fuzzy technology is to replace a person where computers
are hard to use, for example, controlling a nuclear power generation plant's
circulation control system to clean water and to make decisions. Perhaps the
Chernobyl or Mihama plant accidents could have been avoided with these
systems,' he says.
Fuzzy logic, along with more flexible robots and other components, spell
another technological advantage for Japan in the future: being able to
change small-scale production quickly, so that multiple products can be
produced on the same factory line in one day. Mr Matsuyama predicts Japanese
manufacturers will become very good at this small-scale production, which is
a difficult technology demanding ultimate flexibility.
Computerisation would be all the more necessary in production in the sense
that market information should be more effectively connected with the
production process or with the factory itself. But large-scale flexible
production without man will take 8-10 years says Matsushita Electric in
Osaka.
The company believes fuzzy logic, along with neurocomputing technology which
more closely mimics the human brain, will be the main technologies once they
are refined.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (5): Group offers a
lesson to its suppliers - Profile of Case Communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE PALFRAMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT the end of last month Case Communications, the Dowty subsidiary that
makes modems, multiplexors and other data communications products, called
together 80 of its leading suppliers.
It was less than happy about the quality of some of the components it was
receiving and their late arrival. Having spent three years radically and
sometimes painfully overhauling its own manufacturing facilities, Case would
now like its suppliers to do the same.
The company has not issued an ultimatum. With a turnover of just under
Pounds 100m a year it is not big enough to insist on improvements from its
suppliers. Nor would Case's ingrained corporate culture of co-operation and
team-working allow it to contemplate such a move.
The fact remains, however, that Case will reduce the number of suppliers it
uses in the coming years.
The company is no longer willing to spend money testing goods it has
purchased to make sure they perform to specification. Similarly, it does not
want to have to stock large amounts of goods because only 60 per cent are
delivered on time.
Mr Alex Kachellek, the company's manufacturing director, says that Case
delivers 95 per cent of its products on time. Three years ago the figure was
55 per cent. Four years ago the company's performance was not measured. It
was sufficient to know that monthly revenue targets were being met and that
the company was making a profit.
Under these comfortable conditions, the sweeping changes that Mr Kachellek
proposed in 1988 were met with many raised eyebrows.
Even the six-person team he set up to implement the changes had at least one
dissenter at the outset. Apart from improving delivery, Mr Kachellek wanted
to make-to-order (rather than to forecast) and in the shortest time
possible. The first step, he declared, would be to reduce lead times from
six weeks or more to 15 days.
As a youngish electronics manufacturer, Case had a solid foundation for the
structural changes Mr Kachellek sought. The company understood computers and
communication products. They were its business.
All 1,200 people employed at its Watford headquarters could use and had
access to computer terminals. The terminals were networked so that
information generated on its manufacturing resources planning system flowed
electronically from sales via manufacturing to despatch.
From the start Case fostered flexibility among its people.
Divisive practices were shunned in favour of free-for-all parking, a single
canteen and monthly pay cheques. Team working and team problem-solving were
encouraged.
Against all this was the threat posed by competitors in the quickly-changing
electronics industry in the Asia Pacific region.
Case brings out about one new product every month and the life cycle of
these products is only 10 months to two years. Margins are thin.
Case had the advantage of a reputation for product quality but knew it had
to offer its customers speedy and reliable delivery or they would go
elsewhere.
Mr Kachellek is convinced that without the changes he started, Case would be
sub-contracting much of its manufacture to Asia Pacific. Only a small amount
has been sub-contracted and, as manufacturing has improved, some of that is
likely to brought back to the UK.
Case's products are turned out in nine days. Work in progress on the factory
floor is worth about Pounds 300,000 compared with 10 times that amount three
years ago. In other words, the factory is much easier to control.
Mr Kachellek insists that his managers and staff in the factory solved most
of Case's manufacturing problems. Like many manufacturers these days, he
downplays the role of technology.
There have been no large additions to its manufacturing management system in
the past three years, nor has there been large scale automation of the
shop-floor.
Case's biggest single investment in this period of change was the Pounds
22,000 it spent on a machine to insert integrated circuits into a printed
circuit board.
'You don't have to spend lots of money on information technology,' says Mr
Kachellek. 'It is easy to take the technology too far and we've done that in
the past. Manufacturing should be simple and we all need to be reminded of
that.'
Since 1988 Case has switched from a centrally run and organised factory to a
distributed one. Again it is becoming the fashionable thing to do in
manufacturing and it is supported by a similar move from central to
distributed computing.
Case has separate areas for making printed circuit boards, cables, final
products and technical documentation. Each has its own stores. Office-bound
production planners no longer tell the factory floor what to make and when.
Supervisors decide their own schedule to meet the delivery dates given by
the planners.
This way of working has reduced lead times and late deliveries but, stresses
Mr Kachellek, more was needed to reduce manufacturing costs.
Just over 70 people were made redundant three years ago. Since then a
further 150 people in manufacturing have left Case and not been replaced.
Only 150 people remain in manufacturing.
In the year to the end of March, Case reckons that its revenues have
increased by about 15 per cent and that it is one of the few profitable
companies in the data communications business.
Mr Kachellek makes no claims about manufacturing's part in this performance.
He is not sure if Case's customers are satisfied but he knows he is not.
Manufacturing improvements will continue at Case and, Mr Kachellek hopes, at
its suppliers.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (4): A happy band of
users is most important - Justifying the investment, hardware mistakes
prompt need for greater prudence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE PALFRAMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING industry, in particular in the UK, has made large errors in
buying computer hardware and software.
It is not alone. Other sectors, such as retailing and finance, have also
made their fair share of mistakes. However, with hindsight, manufacturing
should to be able to invest more prudently. There are signs that this is
happening.
The biggest breakthrough for medium-sized and large manufacturers has been
recognising what is needed for a successful computer system. It matters
little how rigorously the investment is justified or which manufacturing
system is chosen.
What is important, and obviously so, is having a happy group of users in
sales, purchasing, on the shop-floor and throughout the rest of the
organisation.
Users are likely to be more satisfied if they are allowed to decide what
they want from a system and are then involved in its selection and, finally,
are trained in its use. The steps are simple. They always have been but,
until recently, they have been by-passed.
The reasons are complex but boil down to money and power. The justification
for spending large sums on computer systems was much easier than it is
today. In the past, computers were mainly labour-saving devices and the cost
benefits could be calculated quickly.
Now manufacturers want computer systems that are integrated and intelligent.
They want the vast amount of information that they have collected on their
mainframe machines to be accessible to management to give an up-to-date
picture of the company's performance that can be viewed in any amount of
detail.
'These are big projects where many of the benefits are intangible and it is
very hard to put numbers on them,' says Mr Roderick Roy, a partner with
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte's manufacturing consulting group. 'Companies have
to weigh up the risk of not doing it,' he adds.
For very complex projects some large manufacturers are turning to financial
modelling to determine the impact of their investment on the business.
This is a lengthy process but there are PC-based computer programs to help
and, if these fail, the decision-makers have access to another well-used
method of investment justification. The method is described delicately as
business acumen or, more coarsely, as gut-feel.
Whether the project is small or large, the most common failing in
manufacturing is to underestimate the cost of implementation.
Typically, manufacturing systems for controlling inventory or production
take a year or two before they are fully up and running. During that time
the project has to be managed and people trained. Often neither happens to a
great enough extent.
Investment in information technology should be equalled by the investment in
implementation, insists Mr Alan Toplis, a partner with Price Waterhouse.
'If anyone tells you it is less, don't believe them. I've seen companies
driven to the brink of bankruptcy because they couldn't implement their
systems,' he says.
Power or the corporate pecking order has also stopped users getting what
they want. Data processing departments, historically, have been closer to
the financial director than production and, therefore, have had considerable
influence on a company's computer strategy.
Much of the time they have dictated what hardware was needed and what
software they would develop. When they were only responsible for jobs such
as payroll, pensions and sales order processing, it was of minor concern to
people running the factory.
All that changed when the processing departments started developing
manufacturing resources planning packages for their mainframe computers.
They were convinced that these packages could cut the cost of manufacture by
reducing, among other things, inventory, work-in-progress and lead times.
Some of these systems have been successful. However, many have not.
Mr Brian Entwistle, general manager of British Aerospace's software
development arm, BAeCam, blames the processing department's liking for
mainframes which could not (and still cannot) process information fast
enough for it to reflect the realities on the shop-floor.
A parallel argument is that the department should not have been trying to
computerise the complexities of the shop-floor. Rather that manufacturing
should have simplified its operations first.
So the divide between the processing department and manufacturing has been
created.
It has been maintained by the large computer suppliers which have the ears
of important people in the processing department and a vested interest in
expanding the centralised mainframe strategy.
It has also been supported by top management which operated, like the
computer systems, in an hierarchical manner.
Bridging the gulf has been a lengthy job. It required people to admit they
had made mistakes and management to take back the control of its computer
systems' investments which it had relinquished to the processing department.
Some manufacturers have quietly done this.
However, the numbers that are clinging to the old way are sufficiently large
for disaster stories to abound.
Most of the tales of woe have a common theme: in-house software development.
The issue is rarely whether or not the spending was justified and benefits
enumerated.
Almost always it is the processing department's insistence that
manufacturing's requirements can only be met by bespoke software.
For most commercial and basic manufacturing applications there is now 'very
little justification for developing your own software', says Mr Toplis.
Generic packages typically match about 80 per cent of a company's
requirements. The most up-to-date packages can then be tailored (in
consultation with the users) to deliver much or all of the rest.
'They work,' says Mr Roy. 'They also strip years off the implementation
process which pulls all the benefits forward.'
If manufacturing is to get any satisfaction from its computer investments
the relationship between the board, the processing department and users,
especially in the factory, must change.
It is fashionable to knock the company's information technology people
(sometimes rightly so) for their dictatorial attitude. But, equally, the
people running the factory have been silent in their suffering.
The processing department should offer a service to the users and 'provide a
framework in which they can operate', says Mr Roy. Users should be prepared
to be more vocal about what they want and their working procedures.
Management should minimise the fear of change and of admitting mistakes
among its staff.
'More than ever it is important for manufacturers to learn from the past,
says Mr Roy.
Formal audits after a computer system has been running for a couple of years
will pinpoint what has and has not been achieved (from the users'
perspective).
They have not been favoured in the past, again because people were reluctant
to reveal the reality of their decisions. But, as the rate of change of
computer technology quickens, manufacturers can guarantee that they will be
going through another systems buying cycle in a few years.
Armed with this type of information and a multi-disciplined working group
with access to the board, selecting the right system for the users will not
be easy but it will have a better chance of success.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
computer-aided design and manufacturing equipment - may be slowing down, but
many users in manufacturing industry would give their eye teeth to match the
growth rates projected for suppliers over the next few years.
After the phenomenal growth of the early 1980s, the industry is expanding at
rates of a mere 10-14 per cent a year, depending on the sector. According to
Dataquest, the US market research company, the total Cadcam market was worth
Dollars 13.9bn last year, but this is forecast to rise to Dollars 26.2bn by
1995.
Most big Western manufacturing companies have Cadcam systems, although the
level of maturity and sophistication varies from one country or industrial
sector to another. While this means that some markets will see only
incremental growth, there is little doubt that customers with successful
installations are keen to come back and buy more.
Much of the growth in the next few years, therefore, will come from a
combination of new products and new applications to tempt long-standing
users, and new customers.
In the latter category some UK machine tool companies, for example, are only
now replacing their draughtsman's tables with Cad systems, partly because
the cost of the hardware is falling but also because their clients demand
it. As with robotics, the use of Cadcam is spreading to smaller
manufacturing companies, and particularly the subcontractors in the
automotive and aerospace industries.
Mr Roger Smedley, chairman of the UK engineering design company Ricardo
International, remarks that 10 years ago it was hard to spend more than
Pounds 1,000 per head in capital on each employee's drawing board, desk and
chair.
Now, with some computer screens costing up to Pounds 60,000 including
software, capital expenditure per head has rocketed, but an enormous number
of design companies have gone out of business because they could not finance
a switch to computers or make it work, says Mr Smedley. Ricardo is spending
Pounds 1.5m a year on computers, while one of its rivals, Worthing-based
International Automotive Design, has just ordered an Pounds 800,000 CADDS 4X
system from Computervision, enhancing its ability to provide design, build
and prototyping services to big automotive manufacturers.
IAD has been a customer of Computervision, one of the world's leading Cadcam
suppliers, for six years. Mr Mark Holmes, a UK marketing consultant for
Computervision, notes that manufacturers such as Rover and Ford are asking
their supplier companies to ensure their Cadcam systems are compliant - a
trend that is being driven by the desire for concurrent engineering (design
for manufacturing.)
Computervision, part of Prime Computer, is one of a handful of big players
in an industry which continues to see new niche products and companies
emerging, and thus boasts dozens of companies with revenues so small that
they hardly register at all. Most of these are US companies, followed by
European groups, with Japan back in third place.
Industry observers see a continuing role for the smaller companies, even if
sometimes it is only for their technology to be obtained by the larger
players, through an OEM arrangement or acquisition.
An example of the latter was the acquisition by Computervision of
Massachusetts-based Premise, whose technology extends Cadcam back to the
sketching, or back-of-an-envelope stage in the creation of a design. This
process, known as conceptual engineering, is generating widespread interest
among manufacturers.
There have been takeovers of a different kind. The squeeze on margins in the
late 1980s, caused by the rush into the market in the hope of fat profits,
has left several companies by the wayside.
The electronic design automation (EDA) sector in particular experienced
particular turmoil during this period: Daisy Systems bought Cadnetics in
1988 to form Dazix, but a heavy burden of debt led to its bankruptcy filing
in August. In January, the much stronger US company Intergraph snapped up
Dazix for Dollars 14m.
If the established companies play their cards right, they ought to be able
to avoid Dazix's fate. There are significant opportunities in many
geographic and product markets, and the big suppliers with marketing muscle
are best placed to exploit them.
Mr Jim Tully, Dataquest's UK Cadcam analyst, sees Europe maintaining its 35
per cent share of the world market through to 1995. Germany is already the
biggest market, but still offers the best growth potential because of
reunification. Reconstruction, refitting of factories and a modernised power
network all offer scope for Cadcam sales.
Dataquest predicts the more mature US market will see its share slip from 35
per cent in 1990 to 33 per cent in 1995, while Asia will maintain its 28 per
cent share.
In product sectors, Mr Tully sees the fastest growth in the geographic
information systems (GIS) sector, where Intergraph is the undisputed leader.
'There's a great deal of interest in getting maps on to computer systems,'
he says.
The mechanical sector, which is by far the largest, is growing very slowly,
but even here there are opportunities. In particular, users in this sector
are interested in so-called knowledge-based applications of Cadcam. An
example is a system developed by the small US supplier Rasna, which will
design products such as car bumpers virtually automatically, minimising
weight and performing stress analysis on the basis of a few parameters and
criteria.
Two other trends look like becoming increasingly significant for the
industry. Until recently, most Cadcam systems have been mutually
incompatible, and end-users wishing to change their system have faced a
difficult and costly process. This, says Mr Tully, is changing, because of
'frameworks,' a set of software facilities that allows third-party Cadcam to
be integrated into a user's existing system, or a supplier's product line.
'The whole issue of opening the systems up is the key to a lift to growth,'
he says.
Mr Holmes at Computervision sees another market place opening up -
engineering data management.
Cadcam, he says, was a reasonably controlled environment in the early 1980s
with the host mainframes looking after files. But as engineering companies
have been forced to move more quickly, it has become more important to find
where information resides in a company.
Changing technology has meant that Cadcam is more likely to be based on a
workstation, leading to a proliferation of files, and the need for EDM to
control data more closely.
There is probably no better way of assessing the industry's prospects than
to examine new uses for Cadcam. At Boeing, the introduction of a new
generation of Cad tools is aimed at eliminating the risk of design mistakes.
The lynch-pin is Catia, a three-dimensional Cad programme supplied by
Dassault Systems of France, which incorporates a new stress analysis system.
Linked to a network of IBM workstations and mainframes, Catia will enable
Boeing's new 777 commercial jet to be the first designed completely on
computer.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (2):  Confusion over
the levels of integration and flexibility - Intelligent Machine Tools, a
different approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the beginning there were machine tools, the workhorses of every
mechanical engineering workshop in the world, which are used for cutting,
grinding and shaping lumps of metal to form components for all sorts of
industrial products or machinery.
Then, over the past 25 years, came numerical control and computer numerical
control (CNC), in the form of user-friendly units attached to the machine
tool which can be part-programmed on line by the operator or off-line in the
production engineering office.
Hand-in-hand with the CNC units, whose software can control almost any type
of machine tool, new designs of machine produced the higher precision,
stiffness and stability to take advantage of the greater accuracy that CNC
offers.
CNC, when applied to single machine tools, is well-established, and more
than 80 per cent of Japanese machine tools are numerically-controlled. The
units are powerful enough to control 'machining centres', which can often do
the work of eight or more standard machine tools, and may contain more than
100 different cutting tools.
As the cost of computing power has come down, the economics of computer
memory storage have been transformed, and CNC units can store and recall
hundreds of different instructions for a great variety of workpieces.
From the mid-1980s, further developments in CNC technology have produced the
concept of a 'flexible manufacturing system' (FMS), two or more machining
centres linked and coupled under the control of a host computer. The
important word is 'flexible,' according to the UK Machine Tool Technologies
Association: 'The combined power of the machine and host computer, and their
storage memories, is enough to manufacture all prescribed varieties of work,
in any order.'
FMS is now being being linked to computer-aided design and production
control to produce manufacturing industry's Holy Grail, Computer Integrated
Manufacturing (Cim).
The aim is to link 'islands of automation' on the factory floor with all the
other computerised functions of the manufacturing process, such as
purchasing, ordering, stock control and is proving to be a tougher challenge
than many in the computer industry had predicted only three years ago.
Put at its simplest, there appears to be considerable confusion among
manufacturers about how integrated their approach to Cim should be, or how
flexible their use of FMS. The situation is not helped by a proliferation of
computer suppliers, all keen to sell their product but varying in their
commitment to service and support.
Dr Norman Schofield, director of engineering and systems at PA Consulting
Group, says there are very good technical reasons why Cim has been difficult
for many companies to achieve.
Companies had believed that, to stay competitive, they needed to buy the
best available computers for each of the many different disciplines in the
manufacturing process - packaging, software, documentation, electronics and
mechanical engineering.
This, in turn, increased the size and complexity of the 'data package'
describing the product, and spread the data over many systems.
In one recent assignment, PA found 41 different applications used in a
company's design/engineering process alone, on six different computer
platforms, on 10 sites in three countries.
The problem for the manufacturer, says Dr Schofield, is whether it is going
to get independent advice from any of its computer suppliers if it wishes to
integrate its systems. PA has attempted to help clients through the maze by
building its own Cim centre using four computers and 12 software
applications from nine different suppliers.
The aim is to illustrate the many elements involved in applying Cim to the
relatively simple task of putting parts on to printed circuit boards.
Dr Schofield believes that open systems will be the key to developing
progress towards Cim, and says most computer vendors are prepared to accept
the inevitability of an open environment.
'Manufacturers are getting a lot more help from suppliers, which is all
leading to easier integration.'
However, he says manufacturers can help solve their integration problems
themselves in two ways.
The first goes back to the machine tool itself: manufacturers, if they have
the clout, can insist that all their machine tool suppliers install the same
controller.
Secondly, manufacturers have to accept that integrated systems can be too
heirarchical. 'Where you can have autonomy (in a flexible manufacturing
system, for example) you should let it happen. Some failed systems have
tried to make things too rigid.'
Indeed studies of the influence of FMS in the US since the mid-1980s have
shown that it is often a misnomer, since the system may be inflexible in its
design and the way in which it is used. Also several reports have claimed
that systems installed in the US lack the flexibility of those in Japan.
A recent report on the US FMS market by Frost &amp; Sullivan, the market
research publishers, says worldwide competition is forcing adoption of
flexible manufacturing in a variety of industries, but is becoming
increasingly important to batch-oriented manufacturers as product
life-cycles shorten and product changes become more frequent.
F &amp; S forecasts that sales of FMS equipment will rise from Dollars 266m in
1990 to Dollars 559m in 1995 (in constant 1990 dollars).
The biggest obstacle to installing equipment is price, and more companies
will be starting with the more limited flexible manufacturing cells (FMCs).
In the UK, British Aerospace has taken a novel approach to Cim by developing
its own manufacturing control system, Cimitar, which provides a
sophisticated computerised link between management information systems and
shop-floor controllers.
BAe began the Cimitar programme in 1983 after discovering that computer
companies could not satisfy its large-scale requirement for shop-floor
control systems. A separate company, BAeCAM, was set up in 1988 to develop
and market Cimitar worldwide, but Mr Brian Entwhistle, general manager, says
it was decided from the start to develop a generic product that could be
sold on the open market.
Cimitar, which uses DEC's Vax hardware, is in use throughout BAe but BAeCAM
recently signed up Caterpillar, the US construction equipment group, as a
user. Mr Entwhistle hopes this will provide a reference for further US
sales.
BAeCAM has also installed part of Cimitar on to an IBM PC that runs a
machine tool at BAe, elevating it from the normal download of data and
selection of tools and satisfying the need for complex communications
between the tools and the host computer.
As companies continue to grapple with the challenges of Cim, and consultants
to explain them, its ascendancy is being challenged by another acronym, Pim,
product information management, alternatively known as EDM, engineering data
management. Dr Charles Clarke of London-based Random Computing says that,
just as Cim was the catalyst for integrating manufacture, so Pim forces the
user to understand the existing process before being able to manage it or
use it.
The characteristics of Pim/EDM, which has also been described as a short cut
to Cim via Cadcam, include data management and control and data navigation
mechanisms, but the aim is enterprise-wide control of information.
This, says Dr Charles Clarke, liberates the user and allows true concurrent
engineering - designing a product and allowing its manufacture
simultaneously - for the first time.
'It links the islands of automation that yesterday's manufacturing industry
nurtured and constrains the 'paper flow' monster with its attendant
road-blocks and bottle-necks,' he says with an enthusiasm for metaphor
rarely found in studies of computers in manufacturing.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (1): Japanese still set
the pace - The importance of the human element in the production process
permeates Japanese methods. Now Western companies are beginning to
appreciate that there is a limit to what the computer can do to help the
manufacturers

MANUFACTURING methods have changed profoundly in the US and Europe over the
past few years. The adoption of total quality control and just-in-time
techniques have proven necessary to compete with Japanese manufacturers,
whose fundamentally different approach has set standards of efficiency and
quality Western manufacturers are still striving to emulate.
A comparative study of motor car manufacture in the US and Japan published
recently by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology makes the point
powerfully. General Motors' plant in Framingham in the US takes 31 hours to
assemble a car. There are 135 defects in every 100 cars and a two week
inventory of parts.
Toyota's Takaoka plant in Japan produces a car every 16 hours with on 45
faults per 100 cars. Its inventory is sufficient to sustain production for a
mere two hours.
The West's struggle to compete with Japan's growing manufacturing
superiority has been marked by false starts and expensive excursions up
technological blind alleys.
Western companies failed initially to understand the nature of the
difference in manufacturing philosophies, believing that low labour costs
and heavy use of technology were the answer.
In fact, with the appreciation of the yen, Japan's labour costs are not all
that different from its Western competitors. Japanese manufacturers
certainly use computers but sparingly, preferring to design their products
to suit them for manufacture, rather than the other way about.
They build quality into their products rather than inspect later for faults.
Responsibility for quality control is entrusted to the production worker
rather than the Western-style quality control department.
Increasingly, the trend is to parallelism or concurrent engineering, where
customer requirements, product design, manufacturing technology and cost
accountancy proceed in parallel and information is continuously fed back to
modify the manufacturing processes.
These ideas of design for manufacture and respect for the contribution
individuals can make to manufacturing quality permeate Japanese
manufacturing methods.
They are now diffusing to the West and are the essential backcloth against
which the growing use of computers in manufacturing must be seen.
Computer systems for manufacturers are supplied by computer makers rather
than traditional machine tool companies.
Hardware comes from companies such as IBM, ICL, Digital Equipment, Hewlett
Packard, and Bull Software is supplied by companies such as Istel
Automation, Kewill Systems and Prime Computers among a host of others. All
agree that with most Western economies exhibiting weakness, if not actual
recession, business is tough: 'but not as bad as it's made out to be'
according to Mr Peter Willis of IBM.
Mr Graham McKenzie, technical unit manager for Digital Equipment in the UK
says that buyers are focusing on the business benefits of installing
computer systems.
The industry is not helped by the continuing difficulty the accountancy
profession has found in cost justifying investment in modern computer
equipment.
A detailed study of the US valve industry by Dr Peter Weill called Do
Computers Pay Off?, (ICIT Press, 1990) concluded that the relationship
between computer investment and manufacturing was circular: 'It was not
possible to identify the unique contribution of any particular year of IT
investment. It is not clear that this can ever be achieved statistically'.
The advent of the microprocessor, by making available virtually unlimited
computer power at low cost, has given manufacturers a wide range of
powerful, computer-based technologies which can be deployed on the factory
floor as well as the back office.
There is computer aided design (Cad), pioneered by aerospace and computer
manufacturers, which provides not only an electronic drawing board, but also
product design information.
Computer aided engineering (CAE) automates the design process making it
possible to test the validity of a design before moving to the prototype
stage.
Computer aided manufacturing (Cam) involves a range of intelligent
shop-floor machinery including robots, numerically controlled machine tools,
flexible manufacturing centres and automated handling systems.
Much of this is taken for granted. Mr Brian Small, managing director of
Ingersoll Engineers, a UK manufacturing consultancy, says that manufacturing
computers today look like and are bought like conventional machine tools.
Convenience and simplicity of purchase does not guarantee success in
operation however and there are serious dangers in assuming that
manufacturing problems yield to an injection of technology.
The Strathclyde Institute, an independent manufacturing consultancy warns in
a recent report: 'Many people equate improved competitiveness in manufacture
with the application of state-of-the-art technology such as powerful
computer systems, MRP, Cad and robotics. While it may be advantageous or
necessary for a company to apply these and other enabling technologies in
pursuit of excellence, this should only be as part of an overall company
strategy.'*
'If such technologies are applied to a company without cognisance of the
needs or effects on other areas, at present or in the future, then it may be
difficult if not impossible to integrate the patchwork of systems across the
company.'
Integration is the important word in manufacturing automation. The goal for
forward looking companies is computer integrated manufacture (Cim), an
overused piece of jargon with many definitions.
One comprehensive definition from the Strathclyde Institute is: 'an amalgam
of computer aided engineering and drafting, computer aided manufacturing,
flexible manufacturing systems, tooling and quality support systems,
in-process gauging and automated final inspection, automated storage and
materials handling, and operations control within a business information
system.'
Mr Willis of IBM warns, however, that too often the 'i' in Cim stands for
interconnection rather than integration. There has to be, he explains, an
underlying Cim architecture: 'To complete a 1,000-piece jigsaw, you have to
have all the pieces and a picture on the box.' There is probably not a
single true Cim operation anywhere in the world.
Cell manufacture is emerging as one of the biggest steps towards integrated
manufacture. A survey by Ingersoll Engineers** suggests that over half of
the UK's engineering companies have implemented cell manufacture in some
part of their business.
Cells are self-contained manufacturing units with the machines, controls,
people and support needed to make a finished product complete with payment
schemes, incentives, performance measurements and accountability.
'Well over 90 per cent of manufacturers who have implemented cells have seen
an improvement in performance and 40 per cent describe the improvement as
significant. Fewer than 2 per cent have abandoned the approach,' says
Ingersoll.
Computer technology has a part to play in the flow of information necessary
to support and underpin these developments.
Successful manufacturers in the 1990s, however, will emphasise the human
dimension: 'What do you need to do the job?' will replace the order 'Look
after that machine]'

FT  14 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Asda under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERMARKET group Asda retreated in busy trading as the market continued to
worry about current trading. The shares finished 6 lower at 115p after 8.5m
had changed hands.
The decline was triggered by a weekend press report which identified Asda as
the food retailer most likely to suffer as competition in retailing
intensified. Talk that a broker had changed its investment advice to a hold
from a buy added to the pressure.
Suggestions that Goldman Sachs, which has been positive towards Asda in the
past, had changed its stance was denied. Mr Philip Dorgan of Goldman said
that with higher profits likely next year Asda was cheap at current levels.
BET disposal
The stability of BET shares in a generally weak equity market reflected
relief that the business services group's high level of debt had been
further reduced by the sale for Pounds 212m of Biffa, its waste disposal
business. The price disappointed some optimists who had been hoping for
nearer Pounds 250m, and BET shares slipped before rallying to close little
changed on balance at 178p.
The deal enables purchaser Severn Trent Water to achieve a key objective in
the specialist waste area. It also puts a question mark over Severn's near
30 per cent stake in Caird Group, another waste company. Severn withdrew a
100p cash per share offer last year and is free to bid again in October.
Chief executive Mr Roderick Paul said yesterday the board was 'reviewing the
options'.
Severn Trent fell to 272p but recovered on good buying to 277p for a net
loss of only 3. Analyst Mr Andrew Stone of Hoare Govett said the short-term
reaction was always likely to be down. 'But in the long term the acquisition
buys market share and gets Severn into an area where there is good potential
for development.' He advised clients to buy Severn stock.
SmithKline Beecham proved one of only three firm spots in the FT-SE 100
index. The shares, after recent weakness, ended up a penny at 790p awaiting
today's annual meeting. Rothmans International also bucked the trend, rising
2 to 875p on reports that it was considering buying the outstanding equity
of subsidiary Dunhill Holdings.
Reuters slipped 13 to 802p after bearish analysis from Nomura Research. The
latter maintained its sell stance on Reuters and shaved its profits
estimates for this year and next. Analyst Mr Martin Mabbutt said the stock
would be helped by a strengthening dollar but it still had not bottomed out.
BOC receded 13 to 545p on nervousness ahead of its half-year results due on
Thursday.
Allied-Lyons and Grand Metropolitan lost ground as buyers held off ahead of
trading reports scheduled for this week. Allied slipped 11 to 550p and
GrandMet lost 20 to 800p.
Oil shares failed to escape the general decline in spite of their generally
perceived strong defensive qualities. Specialists said there had been no
fundamental reasons to dump stock in the sector but pointed out that crude
oil prices had once more dipped below the Dollars 20 a barrel mark.
Shell ran back 12 to 511p but volume was a thin 1.8m ahead of Thursday's
first-quarter figures, expected to reveal net income of around Pounds 600m,
compared with Pounds 816m in the same period last year.
Ultramar, a penny harder at 314p, provided one of only three positive
performances in the FT-SE 100 stocks as the market braced itself for
tomorrow's first-quarter numbers. Worries remain that the oil group may post
a loss of up to Pounds 10m for the period, but general consensus is for the
company to manage a modest overall profit.
The threat of further litigation leading to even heavier losses on its
disastrous oil rig conversion contract upset Davy Corporation shares, which
dipped 8 to 120p.
Smith New Court advice to 'top-slice' holdings, meaning take profits, before
the annual results on May 22 brought Courtaulds back 8 to 390p.
More negative assessments from broking houses unsettled Trafalgar House and
the stock lost 4 more to 253p.
Hoare Govett maintains that 'back in November, the huge 15 per cent yield
and plausible recovery hopes added to an attractive story, but with the
shares since rising by over 75 per cent as performance has weakened,
Trafalgar is now well ahead of events.'
BT (formerly British Telecom) held up resolutely against a sharply weakening
market, closing only 3 off at 370p after County NatWest upgraded its profits
forecast and reiterated its buy recommendation. Mr Patrick Wellington at
County raised his profits and dividend estimates on the back of anticipated
lower tax charges.
Mr Wellington said BT offers 'very strong earnings and dividend growth,
excellent medium-term potential through cost reduction, fading political and
regulatory risk, and a strong technical position' ahead of the sale of the
government's remaining stock.
Hoare Govett took a much more cautious view of the stock, however,
recommending that clients move to 'underweight' in the shares.
Butler Cox jumped 99 to 230p after the agreed Pounds 14.3m bid from US group
Computer Sciences.
A number of bank shares were unsettled by stories concerning Brent Walker,
the troubled leisure group.
Standard Chartered bore the brunt of the selling pressure prompted by the
Brent Walker story, closing another 9 off at 370p; turnover was a low
238,000.
TSB was also affected and dipped 2 1/2 to 149p but Lloyds performed well,
holding at 350p. The heaviest turnover in the sector was in NatWest, which
eased 5 to 324p on 1.9m.
Cadbury-Schweppes declined 8 to 366p as speculation about a bond or equity
issue continued to depress the shares.
Dealings resumed yesterday in Sutcliffe Speakman, the activated carbon
company, which was rescued from the brink of receivership by a complex
refinancing plan involving the issue of 150m 10p shares. Sutcliffe shares
touched 12p before making steady upward progress to close at the day's
highest of 16 1/2 p, compared with last October's suspension price of 45p.
Profit-taking pulled Scottish Television back 20 to 697p. The company is
believed to be the only independent broadcaster able to make an uncontested
bid for its franchise when the bidding opens tomorrow. It has outperformed
the sector recently.
TVS Entertainment held firm in spite of poor results, losing only a penny to
64p.
Mr Terry Connor of Smith New Court said the stead-iness showed that 'the
market has chosen to concentrate on the franchises rather than results'.
WPP, the world's largest marketing services group, dropped 14 to 190p after
broker James Capel cut its profits forecast for the company by Pounds 13m to
50m.
Brent Walker, the leisure group, slipped sharply to close 16 down at 40p
following reports that it was expected to announce a Pounds 1bn write-down
of assets. The shares were also depressed by the announcement that 'although
the group produced profits at the operating level, it sustained a
substantial loss for the year . . . and its balance sheet at 31 December
1990 will show a major reduction in shareholders' funds'.
A significant shift in the balance of forecasts of corporate profits by City
analysts during April should not be over-emphasised, warns Barclays de Zoete
Wedd. Analysts have tended to underestimate the depth of the UK recession
and more downgrades may come in the summer.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Weak yen and slide in
New York push Nikkei lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices declined in low volume yesterday, as sentiment was depressed by
Friday's drop on Wall Street and the yen's weakness against the dollar,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 181.09 lower at 26,093.20 after a day's high of
26,338.49 and a low of 26,092.22. Volume shrank to 230m shares from Friday's
340m. Activity has remained under 400m shares for 15 consecutive sessions,
while the Nikkei has traded around 26,000 for 35 trading days in a row.
Falls outnumbered rises by 658 to 279, with 177 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks shed 13.37 to 1,977.78, but in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 2.62 to 1,474.57.
Rumours that the Ministry of Finance had warned a leading Japanese brokerage
concern that it was trading too heavily in the over-the-counter market
depressed sentiment on the smaller sections. The second section index lost
23.32 to 3,400.13 and the OTC index fell 106.12 to 3,126.13.
Traders said institutions were likely to remain on the sidelines as long as
the Nikkei stayed around 26,000, and ahead of some company results to be
announced in the next few weeks.
The electrical sector weakened on reports that Pioneer Electronic had
revised its earnings projections downward and now expected a 21 per cent
profits fall. Pioneer dropped Y630 to Y4,370, Sony Y180 to Y6,080 and TDK
Y140 to Y5,520.
The real estate sector fell 0.8 per cent on news of weak condominium sales
announced over the weekend. Mitsubishi Estate shed Y20 to Y1,500.
Contractors were also weak, Taisei slipping Y24 to Y975 and Haseko Y14 to
Y906.
Daifuku, an industrial machinery maker, rose initially on recommendations by
Japanese brokerages based on strong sales of the company's automated
warehouses and storage systems. The issue touched a 1991 high, but later
receded on profit-taking to end a net Y10 off at Y2,850.
Investment trusts sold drug issues. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, which expects
its pre-tax profits to rise only 2 per cent, retreated Y60 to Y2,730.
Tosoh, a chemical group, rose Y27 to Y646. The company expects pre-tax
profits to rise 57 per cent to Y11bn thanks to strong earnings at
Shin-Daikyowa Petrochemical, which Tosoh acquired last October.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 167.54 to 29,062.87 on volume of 23.2m
shares. Osaka Sanso Kogyo, an industrial gas maker, declined Y10 to Y665 on
weak earnings for the current year due to rising labour and distribution
costs.
Yamato International, a fashion wear wholesaler, rose Y20 to Y1,200. Strong
earnings are expected this year.
Roundup
ALTHOUGH Hong Kong rose on domestic considerations, most markets in the
region fell in sympathy with the Wall Street slide last Friday.
AUSTRALIA in addition showed nervousness ahead of tomorrow's inflation
report for the March quarter, and results from Westpac and National
Australia Bank due on Thursday. The All Ordinaries index weakened 25.2 to
1,523.1 but turnover expanded from ADollars 231m to ADollars 270m.
BHP, Australia's biggest company, went ex a 21-cent dividend and fell a net
29 cents to ADollars 12.15 in heavy volume. CRA closed 25 cents lower at
ADollars 12.90 after lifting its takeover offer for Coal and Allied
Industries from ADollars 7.85 to ADollars 8.50 a share. The latter put on 4
cents to ADollars 8.60.
NEW ZEALAND broke its winning streak as the Barclays index relinquished
35.53 or 2.3 per cent to 1,538.21 as turnover climbed from NZDollars 19.1m
to NZDollars 27.7m. Fletcher Challenge fell 24 cents to NZDollars 3.90 on
1.5m shares traded, in line with the issue price for 50m shares placed over
the weekend with international institutions. A further 25m new shares might
be issued, to raise a total of NZDollars 292.5m.
BNZ went against the trend, firming a cent to 76 cents after Mr Jim Bolger,
New Zealand's prime minister, rejected repeated speculation that the
government is planning to sell its 58.2 per cent stake in the bank. Fay,
Richwhite, which owns 26.2 per cent of BNZ, closed steady at 72 cents.
SINGAPORE lost almost 1 per cent, the Straits Times Industrial index closing
14.93 off at 1,517.39 in thin trade.
TAIWAN's weighted index fell 106.39 or 1.7 per cent to 6,102.09 on news that
Fuh Hwa Securities Finance was tightening its margin lending to stock market
players. Traders said some 30 per cent of daily turnover came from Fuh Hwa's
margin lending.
BANGKOK complained of lack of drive, and money being drawn out of the market
to subscribe for planned new issues. The SET index finished 17.72 or 2.1 per
cent lower at 828.16 after thin turnover worth 2.85bn baht.
The four new highly priced issues which made their debut last Friday were
heavily sold for a second day. Siam Chemicals fell 14 baht to 134 baht and
Eastern Wire, a construction wire producer, declined 11 to 106 baht.
HONG KONG rose on weekend news that Sino-British talks on the large-scale
local airport project will resume this weekend. The Hang Seng index put on
17.43 to 3,767.63, although turnover fell from HKDollars 1.31bn to HKDollars
1.06bn.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Italy welcomes
larger-than-expected interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY WAS encouraged yesterday by the weekend's interest rate cut, but Wall
Street's sharp fall on Friday subdued most bourses from the outset, writes
Our Markets Staff.
MILAN was lifted by Sunday's full percentage point cut in the Bank of
Italy's official discount rate to 11.5 per cent. The market had expected a
reduction of only half a point, so the larger-than-expected cut was viewed
as boding well for the June trading account, which starts on Thursday.
The Comit index rose 4.08 to 581.24 in volume estimated at L150bn after
Friday's thin L115bn, bloated yesterday by activity related to the expiry of
monthly options.
Italcementi jumped L670 or 3.2 per cent to L21,500 on better-than-expected
1990 consolidated net profits of L206bn, up from L170.3bn, although analysts
suspected that the rise was helped by extraordinary items. The share was
also boosted by news of a L60bn share buy-back programme over the next 18
months which came as a surprise.
FRANKFURT was depressed by rumours that Mr Karl Otto Pohl, Bundesbank
president, would resign, by the drop in popularity of the ruling CDU, and by
a leaked McKinsey report which was said to be negative on German economic
prospects.
Volume slid again, from DM3.4bn to DM3bn, as the FAZ index lost 5.09 to
680.67 and the DAX closed 9.73 lower at 1,610.90. It was a day for dealers
rather than investors, said Mr James Cornish at County NatWest, who added
that Frankfurt was recognising that its outperformance in April had not made
sense, in terms of share price valuation or economic prospects.
There were individual windows to east German recovery prospects, he noted.
Siemens Nixdorf, up DM13 last Friday, rose another DM7 to DM259, turnover in
the stock growing from DM18m to DM49m as attention focused on April orders
for data processing equipment. West German civil servants are being paid
'head money' to go east, and equipment is being bought for their new east
German locations.
Elsewhere, turnover in Continental fell from DM50m to DM25m as the shares
lost DM6 to DM197 on profit-taking.
PARIS drifted lower in quiet trading worth about FFr1.6bn, with the CAC 40
index falling 15.82 or 0.9 per cent to 1,834.45. Among weaker blue chips,
Alcatel Alsthom fell FFr12 to FFr588 on 229,510 shares.
Schneider, the electrical equipment group, closed FFr10 higher at FFr762,
after reaching FFr767 earlier, on volume of 110,375 shares. Investors were
relieved at the removal of uncertainty, following the acceptance of
Schneider's bid for Square D of the US.
Among the big movers, Canal Plus, the television company, gained FFr35 or
3.4 per cent to FFr1,070 on 31,450 shares. Its rival, TF1, was suspended
briefly owing to an order imbalance, before closing FFr10.50 down at
FFr285.50.
Suez eased FFr2.20 to FFr349. The news that the financial holding company
could open up the capital of Banque Indosuez was fairly well received, said
one analyst, amid speculation that Suez could be considering an acquisition
to improve its European merchant banking network.
MADRID's general index edged higher before today's inflation news, rising
0.51 to 285.22. Turnover was moderate, but fell to about Pta15bn from
Friday's heavy Pta28.9bn.
Focsa, which is due to merge with another construction company, dropped
Pta260 to Pta14,140.
AMSTERDAM fell at the opening, and failed to recover for the rest of the
session. The CBS tendency index closed down 0.5 at 94.4 in quiet trading
worth Fl 480.8m.
Royal Dutch led the losers, shedding Fl 3 to Fl 160.70 after setting an
all-time high of Fl 165.10 on Friday. The oil company reports its
first-quarter results on Thursday.
Unilever, which reports its quarterly results on Friday, fell 80 cents to Fl
158.40.
OSLO recouped an early loss to close at its third consecutive year's high.
The all-share index gained 2.76 to 521.46.
STOCKHOLM was depressed by weak overseas markets and profit-taking in Astra,
the pharmaceutical company. The Affarsvarlden General index lost 6.4 to
1,037.5 in turnover of SKr315m, down from SKr325m.
Astra free B shares fell SKr9 to SKr575 before the company's first-quarter
profits announcement, which came after the bourse closed and were better
than expected.
ZURICH fell in low volume, the Credit Suisse index slipping 3.8 to 541.7.
Slightly lower interest rates gave some support. In a relatively firm
engineering sector, Schindler registered shares rose SFr60 to SFr1,095
before today's annual news conference.
BRUSSELS, after its holidays last Thursday and Friday, was dominated by
Petrofina, the oil company, which rose BFr200 or 1.7 per cent to BFr11,800
with 25,420 shares changing hands, or nearly 30 per cent of the BFr939m
market turnover.
The Bel 20 index closed 4.68 higher at 1,179.39. After hours, Groupe
Bruxelles Lambert repeated that it would probably increase its 21 per cent
Petrofina stake.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Oslo joins small band of outperformers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACQUELINE MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECLINE in the US, which was at the mercy of the bond market during the
quarterly refunding, left the world's stock markets 0.6 per cent lower in
local currency terms last week, according to the FT-Actuaries World Indices.
Most markets, however, were little changed. The main exceptions were the now
familiar outperformers of Mexico and New Zealand, joined last week by
Norway.
The Norwegian market, which has lagged behind most European bourses this
year, jumped 8.5 per cent in local currency terms. Daily turnover grew from
a level of NKr302m at the start of the week to NKr820m on Friday.
Mr Per Jacobsen of Baring Securities says the triggers for this renewed
interest included rising optimism about the economy and company results,
falling interest rates, the market's relative cheapness, and decreasing
pessimism over the tax reforms.
Good first-quarter figures in early May, particularly from Saga Petroleum
and Hafslund Nycomed, the pharmaceutical group, have banished investors'
earlier doubts. Baring now expects weighted earnings growth of 11 per cent
this year, after a fall of 28 per cent in 1990.
The proposed tax reforms have also become less of a concern. 'People have
had time to consider the reforms and are less alarmed by them, and there are
indications that they are being watered down,' says Mr Jacobsen.
He even believes the proposed tax changes could have some positive effects.
From 1992, capital gains on shares held for more than three years will no
longer be tax free. However, the cost price of these shares will be set by
taking the average share price between November 1 and December 31 this year,
which means that shareholders will want to see high prices during that
period, and so reduce their capital gains and the tax payable. 'If the rules
come through in their present form, a year-end rally seems likely,' he
predicts.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Money Markets: London rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES WERE little changed on the London money market yesterday, with
three-month sterling interbank continuing to discount a cut of  1/2 point in
bank base rates, despite last Friday's strong warning from the Bank of
England against an early move.
The authorities reinforced this view yesterday by not supplying enough
assistance to take out the full underlying shortage on the money market,
leaving overnight funds tight at around 12 1/2 per cent.
Three-month interbank was quoted at 11 9/16 -11 1/2 per cent, compared with
11 9/16 -11 7/16 previously, and 12-month money was unchanged at 11 1/8 -11
per cent.
Short sterling futures traded in a narrow range of 88.81 to 88.87 for June
delivery on Liffe. The contract opened lower at 88.85 and closed at the
day's low of 88.81, compared with 88.88 on Friday.
Day-to-day credit was in more comfortable supply than of late on the cash
market. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 500m,
but revised this to Pounds 450m at noon, and to Pounds 400m in the
afternoon. Total help of Pounds 201m was provided.
The authorities did not operate in the market before lunch, but in the
afternoon bought Pounds 121m bills outright, by way of Pounds 1m Treasury
bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 120m bank bills in band 1 at
11 7/8 per cent. Late assistance of around Pounds 80m was also provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 849m, with the unwinding of repurchase
agreements on bills absorbing Pounds 322m, and bank balances below target
Pounds 5m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 50m to
liquidity and a fall in the note circulation of Pounds 650m.
In Madrid the Bank of Spain left its money market rate unchanged at 13.5 per
cent at yesterday's thrice-monthly repurchase tender for central bank
certificates. This is the main instrument of Spanish credit policy and was
last changed on March 15.
In Brussels the Belgian National Bank left its seven day advances rate, the
main instrument of monetary policy, unchanged at 8.75 per cent at a tender
for credits against government paper and commercial bills.
In Frankfurt call money rose to 8.85 from 8.80 per cent as payments for a
government bond drained about DM7bn from the money market.

<TEXT>
TWO BRAZILIAN mineral groups have just clinched a deal to mine an estimated
720,000 tonnes of zinc and 180,000 tonnes of lead in a mine near Lima, Peru.
Companhia Paraibuna Met-ais, the second largest zinc producer in Brazil, has
entered in-to a joint venture with Brazilian-based Construtora Norberto
Odebrecht, Peruvian-based Mineracao Barra Ventura, and Minero Peru, the
state-owned mineral group of Peru.
The groups will have shares in the project of 45 per cent, 15 per cent, 15
per cent, and 25 per cent respectively.
Mr Ronaldo Salerno, president of Paraibuna, said the company signed the deal
to guarantee a zinc supply for its Brazilian refineries. 'Control over the
mine will also guarantee quality,' added Mr Salerno. Brazil has few known
zinc reserves.
Salerno also announced that the group was exploring reserves in Bolivia,
with an eye to opening up zinc mines in that country.
The Peruvian joint venture will require a Dollars 50m investment over the
next four years. By 1996, Mr Salerno expects the mine to be in full
production.
Mr Salerno cautioned that, although the joint venture has been agreed, the
group will not put any money into the project until it has confirmed Peru's
estimates of zinc deposits in the area.

issues rush
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL bond market was awash with new issues yesterday as
borrowers launched deals delayed last week by public holidays in Europe and
the Treasury refunding operations in the US.
Against the background of Citicorp's global asset-backed deal, the sterling
sector of the mortgage-backed market was tested by a Pounds 200m
twin-tranche issue from Mortgage Funding Corporation No. 4, a
special-purpose vehicle of Eagle Star.
Lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston, the deal offers paper with an
average life of 1.5 and five years.
Every deal in the sector this year has pushed back the limits of terms which
are acceptable to investors.
For example, the longer-dated tranche of yesterday's issue pays a discounted
margin of 62.5 basis points over the three-month London interbank offered
rate.
This is identical to the discounted margin offered on the tranche of the
recent issue by CMS No 9, which had an average life of 3.6 years.
Recent deals have abandoned the earlier practice of offering investors a
step-up in margin from next year if banks are forced by the regulators to
put aside more capital against holdings of mortgage-backed paper. As
sentiment has improved, non-bank investors have started to buy
mortgage-backed bonds again, making the market less vulnerable to the
proposed regulatory change.
The UK government bond market was weak throughout the day, but this did not
prevent Tokyo Electric Power from becoming the latest Japanese borrower to
issue sterling-denominated bonds.
The borrower issued Pounds 150m of 10-year bonds priced to yield 52 basis
points over the 10 per cent gilt maturing 2001. The yield spread is wider
than on other recent deals by Japanese names. For example, Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone launched its Pounds 100m deal at a spread of 50 basis points
over gilts and has now tightened to 45 basis points. However, Tokyo Electric
Power is less well known in the international bond market.
Despite negative sentiment in the market, lead manager Credit Suisse First
Boston opted to press ahead with the deal. Having been reoffered to
investors at a fixed price of 99.70, the bonds traded down to 99.40 as gilts
weakened. However, the yield spread remained at around 52 basis points.
Credit Lyonnais became the first bank to issue longer-dated Eurodollar bonds
for some months, launching a Dollars 300m seven-year deal. The deal,
increased from Dollars 250m, offers paper priced at a yield spread of 74
basis points over US government bonds.
Participants said the yield spread was generous enough to tempt investors
looking to lengthen the duration of their portfolio exposure to the US
currency.
The lead manager, Credit Lyonnais, reported strong buying from continental
European investors. The paper traded at around the fixed re-offer price of
99.40.
The Republic of Ireland yesterday raised Pta10bn with an issue of seven-year
bonds in the Spanish market. The deal maintained international interest in
peseta-denominated bonds, which was given further impetus by the cut in
Italian interest rates over the weekend.

The financing, which complements a Dollars 2.5bn bankers' acceptance

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE securities companies, under pressure to allow banks into their
industry, have reaffirmed their opposition to banks entering stockbroking,
the most lucrative part of their business.
However, they are prepared to see banks compete in the underwriting market,
according to a draft report to the Ministry of Finance made public over the
weekend.
The concessions are unlikely to satisfy banks or end a prolonged debate over
the reform of Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Law - Japan's
version of the Glass-Steagall Act in the US.
The draft report, prepared by a study panel of the Securities and Exchange
Council, an advisory body to the ministry, recommends allowing banks to
lead-manage publicly-placed bonds through subsidiaries, and to issue
privately-placed bonds.
However, it says banks should, 'for the time being,' be banned from broking,
the backbone of the securities companies' profits. The Securities and
Exchange Council, organised by the Finance Ministry's securities bureau,
represents the views of the securities industry.
A parallel report, representing the views of banks, is expected to be
published soon. It will probably call for banks to be granted more
comprehensive access to the securities market, including early entry into
broking.
The reports are part of a review of the barriers separating banks and
securities companies under Article 65. The ministry wants to implement
reforms by 1993. Officials are having to balance the demands of banks for
change with calls from the securities industry, particularly small and
medium-sized companies, for preserving the status quo.
A ministry official said the final reports of the securities and the banking
industries are expected to be presented to the ministry at the end of May,
or some time in June.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Shielding investors from
predators - The role of contingent value rights in a bull market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any revival of mergers and acquisitions activity in the US could renew
interest in a family of financial instruments headed by CVRs - contingent
value rights - which offer investors protection against a poorly performing
stock price.
While just a handful of contingent financial instruments were issued in the
bull market of the late 1980s, interest could be stronger this time around
the economic cycle.
The company issuing the CVR targets a future share price and promises to pay
the holder the difference between the target price and the actual share
price at the exercise date, subject to an upper limit.
Hence the company may face a substantial liability if its shares do not
reach the target price.
Alternatively, if the shares perform well, the CVRs expire worthless.
In the US, CVRs were originally issued following the mergers which formed
the pharmaceutical groups Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Marion Merrell Dow in
1989.
For example, Dow Chemical will pay the holders of its CVRs the difference
between Dollars 45.77 and the price of Marion Merrell Dow shares in
September this year - up to a maximum payment of Dollars 15.77 or Dollars
1.5bn in total.
Last week Marion Merrell Dow shares were trading at Dollars 34 per share,
implying a Dollars 11-per-CVR, or Dollars 1bn, liability.
However, Dow Chemical has the option of extending the deadline by one year,
in which case the target share price rises to Dollars 50.23 and the maximum
payment Dollars 20.23.
The acquiring companies view the CVR liability as something akin to a
deferred consideration, which is revealed in a note to the annual report and
accounts.
'From the predators' perspective, these are instruments which offer a kind
of earn-out to stockholders in the company which is being taken over,' said
Mr Ben Krause, head of the capital markets group at the American Stock
Exchange in New York, on which both the Dow and Rhone-Poulenc CVRs are
listed.
This type of profits participation role was even more obvious in an earlier
issue of contingent payment rights for Eli Lilly. These instruments gave
holders the right to profits participation following the Dollars 350m
acquisition of Hybritech in 1986.
In part, CVR issues were driven by an accounting loophole, which allowed the
dominant partners in the merger - Rhone-Poulenc and Dow Chemical - to keep
goodwill resulting from the transaction off the merged entities' balance
sheet. This is particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry, where
valuations of companies are well in excess of asset value, reflecting the
future value of drugs still in the research and development phase.
The amortisation of goodwill arising from mergers would severely depress the
profits of the merged entity.
The US accounting loophole has now been closed, but CVRs have not
disappeared from the corporate finance scene.
Contingent participation rights - whether based on profits performance or
share price performance - could be used as a defence against takeover by
guaranteeing holders a minimum return on investment.
NCR, the US computer manufacturer, reportedly considered issuing CVRs as a
defence against AT&amp;T's hostile bid. Consolidated Goldfields also considered
making a CVR issue as a defence against Minorco.
There certainly seems to be an appetite among international investors for
instruments which offer some form of protection against a poorly performing
share price.
For example, Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, decided to issue
unusual 'bull spread' warrants rather than ordinary equity warrants in a
Dollars 1bn issue in April.
Just like CVRs, the 'bull spread' warrant structure offers protection
against a collapse in the share price over the next three years - but at the
cost of limiting annual returns.
The warrants were issued when Roche shares were trading at around SFr7,500.
On the exercise date in May 1994, holders of the warrants can either take
one Roche share, a cash payment of SFr7,000, or, at the companies
discretion, a cash payment of SFr10,000.
There certainly seems to be a future for contingent financial instruments in
one form or other. However, the permutations are many and the risks to the
issuing company could be significant. Corporate financiers make two points:
The promise to compensate for poor share price growth, and therefore
presumably for poor earnings growth, is only credible if the issuer is a
strong company. Roche, Dow Chemical, Rhone-Poulenc and Eli Lilley are all
solid blue-chip stocks. However, the roster of potential issuers is limited
to larger corporations able to weather a downturn in performance.
Only a brave company would target its share price in the current uncertain
economic climate. The experience of convertible bonds incorporating a put
option - which allows the holder to cash in the bonds early - may have been
chastening.

SA BREWING Holdings, the diversified Adelaide-based brewing and
manufacturing group, yesterday said it had more than doubled its share of
the US water heater market through the USDollars 31.65m acquisition of
Mor-Flo Industries.
SA Brewing said the acquisition would give it 30 per cent of the US market
for mains pressure water heaters, which accounts for around 7.6m units a
year.
The group entered the US water heaters market in 1989 thorough the purchase
of Bradford-White Corporation of Michigan, which claimed around 12 per cent
of the market.
Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing managing director, said the acquisition of
Mor-Flo, which has annual sales of around USDollars 200m, was in line with
the group's long-term strategy of increasing its US presence. Mr Wilson said
SA Brewing would rationalise the manufacturing operations of Mor-Flo and
Bradford-White.
The deal, which is subject to US regulatory approval, is expected to be
concluded in August.

Excluding the special item, consolidated profit dipped 3 cents a share, due

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEMOTEC Data of Montreal says a proxy fight to remove three of its directors
is a thinly-disguised effort by telecommunications conglomerate BCE to gain
control over Canada's overseas telephone monopoly.
Mr William McKenzie, Memotec's chief executive, took full-page
advertisements in Canadian newspapers yesterday, accusing BCE of seeking to
undermine the 'independent direction' of its wholly-owned telephone
subsidiary, Teleglobe Canada.
'This is not an issue about Memotec management,' Mr McKenzie said. 'The
issue is control of Teleglobe.'
Memotec announced yesterday that it earned CDollars 1.1m (USDollars
950,000m) in the first quarter, compared with a CDollars 4.1m loss a year
earlier. Revenues rose by 9 per cent to CDollars 99.9m. The company ascribed
the improvement mainly to better operating results from its
telecommunications businesses and the restructuring of computer
subsidiaries.
BCE controls Bell Canada, the country's biggest domestic telephone company,
and is also the controlling shareholder of telephone equipment maker
Northern Telecom.
BCE has a 31 per cent stake in Memotec, and has expressed its displeasure in
the past over the company's management.
However, the proxy fight was launched last week by Gordon Capital, a Toronto
securities firm. BCE will have to abstain in the proxy vote, which is due to
be taken at the annual meeting in Montreal this Thursday. BCE has an
agreement with Memotec to vote only for its own nominees to the Memotec
board.
Gordon said last week that it owns no shares in Memotec. If its proxy fight
is successful, however, its three nominees plus four directors representing
BCE could outvote the rest of the board.
Memotec's other large shareholders have not yet said how they will vote.
They include the Caisse de Depot, the Quebec public-sector pension plan, and
the Ontario municipal employees' pension fund.
In its proxy solicitation, Gordon criticised Memotec for expanding into
high-technology businesses by using cash mainly from Teleglobe.
Mr McKenzie called Gordon's move an 'ambush' which gives inadequate time for
shareholders or management to consider their positions. Memotec has hinted
it might seek to postpone Thursday's meeting as part of its defensive
tactics.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MGM-PATHE, the embattled Hollywood studio acquired by Mr Giancarlo
Parretti's Pathe Communications for Dollars 1.3bn last year, has won a brief
respite in its fight for survival.
The company has reached an out-of-court settlement with a group of creditors
who had filed a suit to force the studio into involuntary Chapter 7
liquidation.
The studio has agreed to pay Dollars 15m of claims in full, and the
creditors will join in a motion to dismiss the case. A hearing has been
scheduled in a federal bankruptcy court for Thursday.
The settlement with creditors was crucial to MGM-Pathe's survival. Credit
Lyonnais, the French bank, had made a Dollars 145m loan contingent on the
suit's dismissal.
Credit Lyonnais, an important backer in several of Mr Parretti's
acquisitions, has already provided at least Dollars 250m in loans to
MGM-Pathe.
The promised Dollars 145m loan should be sufficient to allow MGM-Pathe to
release several films which have been delayed because of the studio's severe
cash-flow problems.
MGM-Pathe's future, however, is far from certain. About Dollars 70m of the
Dollars 145m loan is already spoken for in undisputed claims which the
company said it would pay as soon as the creditor petition is dismissed. And
the company, which has sold its valuable film library, is in desperate need
of a large hit film.
Credit Lyonnais, which has been facing growing criticism at home over its
dealings with Mr Parretti, has become more aggressively active in the
studio's management. Pressure from the bank is believed to be behind the
ousting of Mr Parretti from the helm of Pathe Communications last month.
In addition, MGM-Pathe must reduce its obligations to Credit Lyonnais to
Dollars 125m by the end of November or the bank will gain voting control of
Pathe and will be allowed to sell 51 per cent of MGM-Pathe or Pathe
Communications.
As part of its plan to repay Credit Lyonnais, a 40 per cent stake in
MGM-Pathe has been essentially put on the block.

privatised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN government expects to proceed in mid-June with the first phase
of privatising Petro-Canada, the country's biggest domestically-owned oil
company.
The PetroCan privatisation is the biggest so far in the programme started
seven years ago by the government of Mr Brian Mulroney.
Based on a preliminary prospectus filed late last week, analysts predict
that the public offering of a 15 per cent stake in PetroCan will raise close
to CDollars 500m (USDollars 434m).
Foreigners can subscribe for up to 25 per cent of the issue, but no
shareholder will be permitted to own more than a 10 per cent stake.
Investors will be required to buy at least 50 shares. Small investors who
apply before June 14 for between 50 and 250 shares will be given priority.
RBC Dominion Securities is the lead underwriter.
Analysts expect that, if only for political reasons, the issue will be
priced attractively, about CDollars 15 a share, well below the company's net
asset value.
The preliminary prospectus was accompanied by an announcement that PetroCan
suffered a CDollars 52m first-quarter loss, compared with profits of
CDollars 40m a year earlier. The loss was blamed mainly on low refining
margins and a CDollars 14m restructuring charge.
PetroCan was created in 1975 to give Ottawa a window on the energy industry.
Much of its growth came from the acquisition of Canadian assets from foreign
oil companies, including Atlantic Richfield, Petrofina and BP. Assets were
CDollars 7.3bn at the end of last year.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Bankers Trust sheds 200 jobs in
restructuring move

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE slump in corporate finance activity in the US claimed more victims
yesterday when Bankers Trust, the New York banking group, announced the
restructuring of its corporate finance department at the cost of 200 jobs.
The job losses are a result of Bankers Trust's decision to merge the three
units which covered worldwide lending and financing activities into a single
Global Corporate Finance department which will provide commercial and
investment banking services to the group's US and international clients.
Although the redundancies will be spread throughout the group's offices
across the world, the bulk will come from Bankers Trust's New York
headquarters.
The costs of compensating the 200 dismissed staff has already been accounted
for by the severance pay expense reported in the first quarter.
So far this year, the group has shed 600 of its 13,000 staff, and more
redundancies are expected as part of a general cost-cutting programme.
The lay-offs at Bankers Trust are a result of the worldwide downturn in
corporate finance business, primarily caused by the slowdown in economic
growth worldwide and the credit crunch in the US and Japan.
Lower interest rates in the US have so far failed to spur any significant
increases in bank lending to companies. Moreover, big mergers and
acquisitions are still a rarity, and junk-bond financing remains in the
doldrums. The result has been a sharp drop in income from corporate finance
activity, an area of traditional strength for Bankers Trust.
Although it has avoided some of the other problems afflicting US banks (it
is considerably less burdened by bad real estate loans), Bankers Trust has
not been immune to the corporate finance slump.
Fees earned by the group from corporate finance business fell 23 per cent in
the first quarter of this year, and in the whole of 1990 corporate finance
fees were down by 27 per cent.
As part of the restructuring, Bankers Trust has set up several new units,
including those to cover the real estate and energy business.
An integrated European merchant banking unit based in London that will
tackle eastern European corporate finance has also been established.
Mr Ralph McDonald, formerly head of corporate finance for North American and
Europe, and Mr George Vojta, who was in charge of financing in emerging
markets in less-developed countries, will be joint heads of the new global
finance department, which will also handle lease and project finance and
asset-backed lending.

company suffered a fall in net profits to DM28m last year from DM35.9m in
1989. Operating profits were DM67.7m, against DM90.9m. Earnings per share
fell from DM62 to DM51. The company is holding its dividend at DM20 per
share and DM21.50 per preference share.
Hugo Boss said its earnings potential remained strong this year, but it was
too early in the year to make a profit forecast because of the uncertain
outlook for the German economy and the dollar.
Mr Gunther Strothe, management board member for finance, said Hugo Boss's
profit had fallen, largely due to DM30m in extraordinary depreciation on US
activities.
'Disregarding the effect from the extraordinary depreciation on the parent
company, its operating profit would have been DM88.9m - just under 14 per
cent of sales - or DM7.8m more than the previous year,' Mr Strothe said.
In the first four months of this year, parent company sales had risen by
more than 10 per cent, he said, adding the company did not expect to take
any extraordinary depreciations this year.
Majority control of Hugo Boss was sold in December 1989 to Leyton House, a
privately-owned Japanese group specialising in sports and leisure wear.
Leyton is controlled by Mr Akira Akagi.
Hugo Boss floated 20 per cent of its equity capital on the German market in
March 1989. The shares were sold by the company's two founding brothers, Uwe
and Holy Boss.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Astra jumps 45% before tax

<TEXT>
ASTRA, the Swedish pharma-ceutical company, yesterday exceeded market
expectations by posting a 45 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to SKr757m
(Dollars 122.4m) for the first quarter of 1991 as sales of its stomach ulcer
drug Losec doubled.
Analysts had predicted a 35 per cent growth in earnings for Astra, which was
the best performer on the Stockholm bourse last year. The company, headed by
Mr Hakan Mogren, had revised upward its forecast for the year, saying
profits would climb by 30 per cent to SKr3.3bn. Its previous forecast had
estimated growth at 25 per cent.
Operating profits increased by 22 per cent to SKr598m. Improved net interest
income from Astra's large cash reserves, which totalled SKr5bn at the end of
March, and favourable exchange rates for income from its foreign
subsidiaries contributed to the buoyant pre-tax earnings.
Sales during the period increased by 27 per cent to SKr2.74bn, with turnover
from Losec, Astra's largest-selling product, increasing to SKr577m from
SKr284m a year ago.
Marketing of Losec by licensees, primarily Merck in the US, raised the
drug's total sales to SKr880m from SKr360m.
Losec suffered a setback in the US in January when the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) refused to approve the drug for first-line treatment of
all ulcers. Astra said yesterday that it is holding talks with the FDA on
widening its approval of Losec usage and it predicted that the FDA will make
a decision in the near future.
Losec was also introduced last month in Japan, potentially the biggest
national market for the drug after the US.
Drugs for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, dominated by Losec,
had total sales of SKr626m, a 88 per cent increase. Drugs for respiratory
diseases, however, remain Astra's largest product group, with sales climbing
to SKr643m, a 26 per cent rise.
The Turbohaler, an inhaler which delivers medication for asthma patients,
has boosted sales for two asthma drugs. Sales of the new asthma agent
Pulmicort increased by 57 per cent to SKr264m, while sales for the older
bronchial drug Bricanyl rose by 19 per cent to SKr182m.

Strong and Fisher said it was selling its shares in New Zealand Light
Leathers because it wanted to focus on its UK operations. The remaining 18
per cent is still listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange.
The shares were bought by Strong and Fisher in 1988 and have a market value
of about NZDollars 6.8m based on the last traded price of NZDollars 1.40. In
1988, the shares were selling at about 70 cents.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: CRA increases offer for Cail to
ADollars 8.50 a share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining group, yesterday attempted a knockout blow in its
hostile takeover bid for Coal and Allied Industries (Cail) by raising its
offer from ADollars 7.85 to ADollars 8.50 a share, valuing the company at
ADollars 472m (USDollars 370m).
CRA, a 49 per cent subsidiary of RTZ of the UK, holds around 13 per cent of
Cail. The acquisition would probably allow it to overtake the Broken Hill
Proprietary Company as Australia's biggest coal exporter by the middle of
the decade.
The group also declared its bid unconditional, and said it was confident of
receiving acceptances for more than 50 per cent of Cail shares before the
offer closes on Monday.
However, Mr Neil Currie, Cail chairman, told shareholders in a letter that
they should continue to reject the offer, which is pitched 10 cents below
last night's closing price of ADollars 8.60 on the Australian Stock
Exchange.
The revised offer is also substantially lower than a valuation of between
ADollars 10.70 and ADollars 11.20 put on Cail last week by Grant Samuel and
Associates in a report commissioned by Cail.
The report said the CRA offer failed to reflect the strategic value of the
low-cost mines operated by Cail, Australia's second largest coal producer.
CRA said the revised offer represented a premium of 33 per cent on the
average market price for Cail during the current year, and warned it would
not be increased.
Analysts said it was unclear whether the offer would tempt sufficient
shareholders to give CRA victory. However, National Mutual and BT Funds
Management, which each hold around 7 per cent of Cail, said they would
consider the offer.
CRA has been cautious in its pursuit of Cail because of losses on its
ADollars 300m purchase of most of British Petroleum's Australian coal assets
in 1989, for which analysts say it paid too much.
In a separate development yesterday, CRA said Novacoal, a 60 per cent
subsidiary, had sacked 278 employees following a walkout at its Howick coal
mine in the Hunter Valley, the premier coal-producing region of New South
Wales.
The walkout followed the sacking of three employees for refusing to comply
with changes in work practices implemented to reduce losses running at
ADollars 9.5m a year.
The dispute is expected to go before an arbitration commission tomorrow but
CRA said it would not continue to operate the mine at a loss. The mine, 40
per cent owned by Mitsubishi of Japan, produced 3m tonnes of steaming and
coking coal last year.

SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest insurer, has announced a co-operation
agreement with the Lucky Insurance Company of South Korea, a part of the
industrial and commercial conglomerate, Lucky Goldstar.
Lucky is one of the largest non-life companies in Korea with total assets of
over Pounds 290m.
Sun Alliance will establish a representative office in Seoul, reinsure a
portion of Lucky's local business and insure some of its overseas
subsidiaries.
The two companies will also exchange technical and market information. Sun
Alliance is interested in the long-term prospects of sales in the rapidly
growing South Korean life insurance market.
Contact with Lucky was made via Wm McGee, a US underwriting agency, owned by
Sun Alliance, which handles Lucky's US business.
The deal is the third announced by Sun Alliance in the Far east in the last
six months. Last December it established a new general insurance subsidiary
in Indonesia in association with leading local business interests. In
January it increased its share of the New Zealand market by buying a local
subsidiary of the Guardian Royal Exchange.
Sun Alliance also has a co-operation agreement with the Japanese company,
Taisho.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: The hidden timebomb in the convertible
package / Explore issuing companies' varying approaches to dealing with the
put option problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMED a good idea at the time. In the bull market of 1987 a number of
companies issued convertible Eurobonds.
They took advantage of rising share prices to set conversion prices at well
above their then share prices.
Further, they shaved the interest payments on the bonds by offering
investors the right to redeem them, usually after five years, at a premium
to the issue price.
This would guarantee the bondholders a return roughly in line with interest
rates at the time.
But, the issuers thought, these put options were never going to be
exercised. By the time they were due, the share price would have risen, the
bonds would have been converted.
The companies would have issued equity, and they hoped, the holders of the
new shares would have been drawn from the pool of international investors
who buy Eurobonds, thus widening the shareholder base.
Now it is all too obvious that there was a flaw in this logic.
The stockmarket crash of October 1987 meant that the share prices of many
companies fell well below the conversion prices. Suddenly the put option,
which had seemed unimportant, loomed as a potential liability.
As 1992 approached, the year when many of these options become payable,
companies realised they had problems. Unfortunately many of them also fell
on difficult times.
The prospect of a large liability worsened the outlook for companies already
facing poor trading conditions, or reaping the whirlwinds of ill-judged
expansions.
Certainly it was not the instrument itself which was at fault, but the
mistakes of the issuers.
The existence of a convertible with a put option became enough, in some
cases, to trigger a bear raid on the company's shares.
In the case of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, with its Pounds
176.5m convertible Europreference shares due to be redeemed for Pounds 211m
in July 1993, the liability would have been sufficient to put the company
into receivership.
Now most of issuers have found an answer, if not a solution, to the problem.
These answers range from conversion as planned, to a complete refinancing of
the company.
The essence of any such answer is to give the issuer the ability to meet any
likely redemption without straining its balance sheet.
THE WHAT PROBLEM
SOLUTION
Last year Tesco, the food retailer, was able to force its convertible
holders to convert to shares because the group's share price had risen well
above the conversion price.
This is the ideal answer, since it was the outcome intended when the bonds
were first issued. The company has in effect borrowed cheaply for three
years - Tesco's convertible paid interest at 4 per cent - and has increased
its share capital at a price higher than it was at the time of issue.
THE GRIN AND
BEAR IT ANSWER
Many issuers have decided there is nothing for it but to pay up if or when
the put is exercised.
Most are providing for the extra interest which would be due, adding to
their interest charges, with the provision usually accumulating in creditors
in the balance sheet.
Thus, if a put option is exercised, there should not be a sudden charge to
profits, although the cash will have to be found and the bond refinanced.
Providing is not an answer on its own, issuers must also find the cash for
redemption.
One side effect of making the provision is that, as Tesco discovered, having
set supplemental interest against its profits, it could only bring the
provision back into reserves, not profits, in its latest balance sheet.
THE BUY-BACK
With many of the convertible bonds trading well below their issue prices,
companies have been able to buy some of them back, cutting their liability
on exercise of the put. Storehouse and Next, the retailers, have both tried
this route. Not surprisingly, bonds which have been languishing suddenly
spring to life when a company announces a buy-back programme, so issuers
cannot always retrieve much of the issue.
Storehouse was able to buy Pounds 40.5m of its Pounds 69m convertible issue
last autumn. It even made a Pounds 400,000 profit on the transaction. That
leaves only Pounds 28.5m of the issue outstanding, which will cost the
company Pounds 36.8m in April 1992 if the put is exercised, much less than
the original liability of Pounds 89m.
Next has two issues outstanding, and has bought some of each, with purchases
of its larger 5 3/4 per cent bond made recently. It now has Pounds 78.6m of
that issue outstanding, and Pounds 43.3m of its 6 3/4 per cent issue. That
would present liabilities of Pounds 57.8m in January 1992 and Pounds 104.8m
in October 1992.
THE SALE OF ASSETS
WAY OUT
Companies which could not put off the liability, could at least prepare for
it by raising cash. Storehouse has reformed its balance sheet through asset
sales, and should have minimal net debt when its March 31 accounts are
published. It should not have a problem in meeting the put in April 1992.
Next's sale of Grattan, its mail-order subsidiary, for Pounds 168m will give
it net cash until the October 1992 payment is made, and it now has agreed
facilities from its banks.
THE ROLLING PUT WHEEZE
Corporate financiers who had helped companies get into a mess by issuing the
bonds originally, tried to help them out by inventing the 'rolling put'.
This idea was to put off the evil day by offering bondholders an attractive
incentive to stay with their investments. When the first put date arrived,
they would be offered another put perhaps five years later at a new interest
rate.
At first this seemed to excuse companies from providing for extra interest,
since it once again reduced the likelihood of the put being exercised. But
now many expect the first puts to be exercised. Burton, Hillsdown and Asda
each have rolling puts, but of these only Asda is now not providing
supplemental interest. Each expects to have no financial difficulty meeting
the redemption.
THE RIGHTS ISSUE
REPLACEMENT
If the bond is not to turn into shares, then a rights issue is another
answer. That was London International Group's idea when it launched a Pounds
61.6m rights in January. That not only provides the cash to repay its Pounds
50m convertible in March 1992, it also increases the group's equity.
Meanwhile LIG is providing for the extra interest.
THE TOTAL REFINANCING
DESPERATION MEASURE
Saatchi's problems were so severe that the only way out was to refinance the
group. Its Europreference shareholders were offered ordinary shares instead.
Such was the bargaining power of these holders that they now have 64 per
cent of the enlarged share capital.
It is all too easy to blame the bonds themselves or the corporate financiers
who dreamed them up for the problems which have arisen. But it is not their
fault if the money raised was used to finance dubious expansion, or if the
recession has shown up weaknesses in balance sheets. Companies in stable
sectors, such as food retailers, were better able to cope with the possible
liability than those in more cyclical businesses.
Nor should it be forgotten that even those issuers which are forced by
investors to redeem at a premium, have tapped a cheap source of funds
meanwhile.
Many of the redemption yields were set at between 8 1/2 and 10 per cent  -
and the cost of money has generally exceeded those levels throughout the
last five years.

<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS BY several shareholders of EFG, which has interests in forestry and
home and leisure products, to remove Mr Alan Joynes as chief executive was
defeated for the second time at an EGM last week, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
Management and certain shareholders of EFG have been locked in a battle over
the company's future since directors announced their intention to dispose of
the core forestry business and concentrate instead on garden leisure
products.
EFG also warned that difficult trading conditions and high interest costs,
together with exceptional and extraordinary charges and provisions, were
expected to result in a loss of some Pounds 2.2m for the first half.
It added, however, that a reduction in borrowings and costs had placed it in
a better financial position to withstand the recession.
In the year to September 30, EFG reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 84,000,
compared with a profit of Pounds 2.01m previously, as high interest charges
on borrowings of over Pounds 9m took their toll. The final dividend was
passed.
A second resolution seeking to declare the payment of a dividend was, by
consensus, not put to the meeting.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Butler Cox recommends Pounds 14m bid from
US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUTLER COX, the London-based management consulting company specialising in
information technology, is to be sold to Computer Sciences Corporation of
the US in a cash deal worth Pounds 14.3m.
CSC, a large computer systems integration company with an international
reputation for large industrial and government projects, said yesterday that
it had agreed to pay 245p per share for the entire share capital of Butler
Cox.
Following the statement shares in Butler Cox virtually doubled from 131p to
230p. The company was floated on the London stock market in May 1989 at
175p. Butler Cox directors, who between them hold 36.7 per cent of the
capital, are unanimously recommending acceptance of the offer.
Mr George Cox, managing director, said yesterday that 'the price reflects
the potential of the business.'
He said the downturn in the UK economy had hit both the level of
profitability and the share price which had made it impossible for Butler
Cox to make acquisitions using its own paper.
However, he pointed out that the company remained profitable, had grown in
cash and had avoided compulsory redundancies.
In its last financial Butler Cox experienced a 42 per cent fall in taxable
profits to Pounds 760,425 (Pounds 1.32m) on turnover up nearly 15 per cent
to Pounds 10.73m. CSC, with headquarters in Los Angeles, had net income last
year of Dollars 65m (Pounds 38m) on turnover of Dollars 1.7bn.
The two companies said that Butler Cox's presence in Europe would complement
CSC's strength in North America.
Butler Cox is unique in its sector in that its conventional consultancy
activities are underpinned by a syndicated research foundation.
Members of the Butler Cox Foundation include many of the most prestigious
companies in the UK and mainland Europe, brought together by a common
concern to make the best use of information technology.
Last year Butler Cox added an education arm through the purchase of
Cranfield Information Technology Institute.
CSC announced two years ago that it intended to grow the commercial side of
its business through acquisition and had set aside a war chest of Dollars
500m for purchases world-wide.
It already owns Index, a consultancy with offices in Boston, Los Angeles,
New York and London with strong links to Harvard and to Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
The US company said its intention was to bring together Butler Cox and Index
to form a global consulting group. The two companies have a total of some
800 companies worldwide subscribing to their research programmes.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Discontinued activities behind loss at
Cronite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES arising from discontinued businesses, two of which were placed into
administrative receivership, resulted in Cronite Group, the Birmingham-based
industrial holding company, plunging into loss at the interim stage.
For the six months to March 31, the group posted a loss before tax of Pounds
2.21m compared with a previous profit of Pounds 781,000. The deficit stemmed
from a trading loss of Pounds 1.88m at four businesses which the group has
discontinued.
Cronite Alloys, which recycles stainless steel, and Abtex, which makes fire
extinguishers, were placed into administrative receivership at the request
of the company.
The move came after it emerged that Alloys had a shortfall in expected
income of about Pounds 400,000 while the value of certain of its stocks had
been overstated in management accounts. The group also decided that Abtex,
where it discovered thefts approaching Pounds 1m, could not be returned to
profitability without greater financial resources than it had envisaged.
Mr Jim Butler, chairman, said efforts were being concentrated on a capital
reconstruction programme for which the group hoped to come up with proposals
by the year end.
The other businesses being discontinued were Hy Tech Machining and North
American Cronite.
Trading profits of the businesses being continued, which include Cronite
Castings and Atkinson, a manufacturer of fabrications, fell to Pounds
327,000 (Pounds 1.48m) with the group being hit by difficult conditions in
the UK and the high value of sterling which hindered exports.
Turnover amounting to Pounds 22.57m comprised Pounds 11.94m from continued
businesses and Pounds 10.64m from discontinued operations.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Offshoot's receivership threatens West -
Svenska's action puts capital reorganisation in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPOINTMENT of receivers at a subsidiary of West Industries, the heavily
indebted engineering and construction group, not only threatens the group's
attempt to return to financial health, it also jeopardises its ability to
survive as an independent entity.
Svenska Handelsbanken, the Swedish bank, appointed administrative receivers
at Audit &amp; General, after it failed to clear a Pounds 5.8m overdraft. West
acquired A&amp;G, an engineering, nursing homes and property group, and five
subsidiary businesses in March.
The move by Svenska was a blow to West, which was in the final stages of
negotiations with its principal bankers, with a view to converting
approximately Pounds 3m of debt into redeemable preference shares. This swap
would have allowed a rights issue to raise about Pounds 3m to proceed.
More seriously, several other of West's businesses were used as collateral
against the Svenska debt. Unless West's banks agree to take on this debt,
calling in the outstanding collateral could have a domino effect on the
other businesses.
The decision by Svenska, which had been privy to West's refinancing
discussions, has prompted West to file a complaint with the Bank of England.
Mr Chris Charlton, chairman of West, said: 'We are highly displeased with
the actions of the bank, which were inappropriate and precipitous. It
breaches the clearing rules recently laid down by the Bank of England
recommending that banks give due time to any company with restructuring or
refinancing plans to allow those plans to go ahead.'
Had Svenska been willing to wait a week or even a day, the situation could
have been cleared, he added. Instead Svenska, which is fully secured against
its loans, chose to lay its claims on A&amp;G's assets.
Svenska's relationship with A&amp;G had been rocky for some time. Part of the
debt was to be repaid through the disposal of the nursing home businesses.
The sale was, however, blocked by Svenska, presumably on the grounds that
the net assets were worth more than the Pounds 3.9m being paid.
For its part, A&amp;G had not always been helpful in providing the bank with
financial information and interest payments had been late from time to time.
The demise of its subsidiary is the latest in a series of upsets that has
befallen West in recent years. Since it was bought in 1987 in a reverse
takeover by Celtic Haven, an engineer and building contractor, its history
has involved numerous twists and turns.
It began as a pest control and machinery testing business but was
transformed after major management changes in 1988, into an assortment of
businesses with a growing leaning towards leisure. Throughout 1989-1990, the
company embarked on a less-than-successful acquisition spree, buying into
restaurants in London and the US in its attempt to build up its leisure
side.
However, by the time it acquired A&amp;G, the group was already reviewing its
leisure operations. The purchase was part of a restructuring programme aimed
at bringing the group's focus back to light engineering.
During this time its share price plunged from a high of 79 1/2 p on March 27
1987, just after it was floated, to 2p at yesterday's close. In the year to
June 30, the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.79m, against profits
of Pounds 1.32m. Group borrowings of approximately Pounds 18.5m compare with
net assets of about Pounds 9m.
A&amp;G's history is no less colourful. It was bought by Humberside Electronic
Controls in 1988 in a reverse takeover, and embarked on a buying binge
throughout 1989 which left it with several engineering companies, nursing
homes and properties.
A&amp;G's last reported results showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 646,000 in the
year to the end of June. Borrowings totalled Pounds 7.74m at the year-end,
against net assets of Pounds 5.56m.
Nevertheless, there are some grounds for hope at West. Mr Charlton
emphasised that the group's other banks were fully supportive. The
receivership relieved the company of considerable debt owed by A&amp;G, and
'there are precedents for rescue operations that actually achieved better
results for a company in this kind of situation,' said Mr Piers Harford at
Albert E Sharp, West's financial advisers.
There was a possibility, for example, that West could re-acquire two of the
businesses from the receivers, for no increase in its gearing, he said.
Mr Piers admitted that there had not been many successful examples of such
'Texas cavalry rescues' and there was no knowing whether West and its
financial advisers could achieve success in the present banking environment.
'Even in 1974 there was nothing like this mass walking away of banks,' he
said.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: County NatWest in Pounds 25.7m hotels
buy-in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
County NatWest, the merchant banking arm of National Westminster Bank, has
completed a Pounds 25.7m management buy-in of a group of eight hotels.
The company is to be known as Lyric Hotels and the transaction involved the
simultaneous acquisition of the hotels from four vendors.
Lyric has been formed by Mr Alan Goodenough, who will be managing director,
and Mr Norman Jones, finance director. Both worked in the Character Hotels
division of Pleasurama, subsequently taken over by Mecca Leisure.
Mr Nat Solomon, a former chairman of Pleasurama, will join the Lyric board
as non-executive chairman.
Equity of Pounds 11.1m was arranged by County NatWest Ventures and was
invested in the form of ordinary shares, subordinated loan notes and deep
discount loan stock.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Sanderson Electronics dips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SANDERSON Electronics, the computing services group which graduated from the
USM to a full listing in January, experienced a profits fall of Pounds
280,000 to Pounds 1.5m pre-tax for the half year ended March 31.
The associates' contribution fell to Pounds 337,000 (Pounds 649,000) while
interest charges accounted for Pounds 118,000 more at Pounds 264,000. The 16
per cent profits downturn was struck from a turnover Pounds 4.16m higher at
Pounds 10.61m.
Earnings per share declined by 3p to 11p.
The company now pays two interim dividends and a second payment of 3.3p
makes an 8.7p total for the 1990-91 year. For the 1989-90 year an interim of
3p was paid but there was no final.
However, the first interim for the period under review was paid on the day
the final would have been paid.
Mr Paul Thompson, chairman, said that comparing the amounts paid in the
calendar years, 8.7p is being paid in 1991 against 8.4p in 1990.
Looking ahead, Mr Thompson said immediate progress in the UK continued to
depend on the effects of the recession.
He pointed out, however, that the group was well positioned with its
associates to continue to expand its activities on an international basis as
opportunities arose.
The shares closed 13p higher at 138p.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Doctus to sell marketing arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCTUS, the management and personnel consultancy, is negotiating the sale of
Wallace Group, its marketing subsidiary. Discussions are at an early stage,
but if the deal comes off, it could more than wipe out Doctus' Pounds 25m
debt, writes Jane Fuller.
Wallace came into Doctus in June 1989 through the Pounds 26m merger with
Prospective, formerly the Pineapple Group. The all-share deal brought in a
considerable amount of debt.
Prospective had acquired Wallace, a US-based group, in 1988 and the merger
with Doctus had saved it paying up to Pounds 43.75m in shares as a deferred
consideration.
Mr Brian Blake, chairman of Doctus, said at the time of the Prospective deal
that he wanted to build up a diversified business services group. Marketing
accounted for 60 per cent of operating profit last year.
Last month Doctus issued a profit warning for the six months to March 31 and
announced that it had decided to focus on management consultancy and 'human
resources', a technical staff agency, career counselling and training -
hence the question-mark over the marketing side.
A shake-up of management also saw Mr Blake shed the chief executive's role.
Doctus' share price has fallen from 138p to 33p since last May. It gained 1p
yesterday.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: IMI warns of profit fall in 1991 first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMI, the international engineering group, yesterday warned shareholders that
pre-tax profits for the first half would be lower than in 1990, and that
full year results were unlikely to match those of last year. The shares
closed 3p lower at 233p, following a 6p fall on Friday
Sir Eric Pountain, the chairman, told the annual meeting in Birmingham that
it was difficult to predict the results with any degree of precision. Much
would depend on the timing of an upturn in the US and UK economies.
'Personally I do not expect to see any recovery in IMI's trading before the
final quarter at the very earliest,' he said.
His gloomy view of the immediate trading prospects echoed those made last
week by Mr David Lees, chairman of GKN, who noted the falling away of demand
in the first quarter of 1991, continuing the trend of the latter months of
1990. Since then, Mr Lees said, there had been few signs of improvement, and
first half results would be down on the second half of 1990.
These two views emphasised the gulf between engineering industry leaders and
the UK Government on the state of the economy. Government predictions of an
upturn in the middle of the year were not seen as having a strong foundation
basis by those active in the marketplace.
Both GKN and IMI had been engaged in cost reduction exercises. Mr Gary
Allen, chief executive at IMI, said this year the group would spend Pounds
50m on new equipment to increase productivity. Both, too, have cut the size
of their payrolls.
Mr Lees announced that in the first four months of this year GKN had cut
1,100 jobs. This reduced the number employees worldwide to 31,200 from the
end-1990 total, and followed a reduction of 3,600 jobs in 1990. Of the 1,100
jobs, 850 were in the UK.
IMI, with a total payroll of nearly 20,000, had announced or was planning
job losses of 1,000 this year.
In 1990, IMI made pre-tax profits of Pounds 115.1m and GKN produced Pounds
172m.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: RMC strengthens stake in German housing
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RMC GROUP is strengthening its position in the growing German aerated
concrete market.
Its 63.6 per cent owned German subsidiary, Readymix Aktiengesellschaft fur
Beteiligungen (RMA), is paying Pounds 33.7m and merging its Durox aerated
concrete company with Ytong AG, one of Europe's biggest aerated concrete
products groups. This lifts RMA's stake in Ytong from 29.8 per cent to 82
per cent.
In a separate move an RMC associate, Readymix Berlin, has paid about DM25m
(Pounds 8.4m) for Laussig, which operates a factory in Leipzig in eastern
Germany producing about 300,000 cubic metres of aerated concrete annually.
Ytong, which will help manage the Leipzig plant, produced 1.85m cubic metres
of concrete last year from seven plants in Germany and one each in Austria,
France and Portugal.
Durox operates three factories in Holland and one in Belgium producing about
700,000 cubic metres of aerated concrete, which is used to produce
lightweight blocks used widely in housebuilding.
Germany is one of the few European housing markets expected to grow during
the next 12 months with residential development forecast to rise by about 6
per cent this year.
An important factor behind the increased demand has been the flow of
immigrants into the western part of the country from the former East
Germany.
In 1990 Ytong made pre-tax profits of DM31.3m (Pounds 10.5m) on sales of
DM450m (Pounds 152m). Mr Derek Jenkins, finance director of RMC, said the
purchase of an increased stake in Ytong would make a positive contribution
to the group's earnings this year.

Difficult trading, almost doubled interest charges and provisions for bad
debts and reorganisation costs have pushed USM-quoted Westminster
Scaffolding into a loss of Pounds 82,000 for the year ended October 31 1990,
against a profit previously of Pounds 1.47m.
With losses per share of 1p (earnings 9.4p) the final dividend is omitted,
leaving the year's payment at 2p (3p).
Because of the situation in the property market the directors have decided
to sell certain properties for Pounds 5.87m, of which Pounds 2.83m in cash
is payable immediately, and to strengthen the capital base by raising Pounds
3.54m net through a 3-for-2 rights issue at 25p each.
Mr Tom Greenham, chairman, has undertaken to subscribe for 3.2m shares - 21
per cent of the issue.
The shares closed 5p down at 33p.

TILBURY GROUP, the construction and property combine, is selling two large
developments to a new joint venture, Tilbury Phoenix, to be owned with
Philipp Holzmann, the German contractor, and Girozentrale Bank of Vienna.
Holzmann already owns 29 per cent of Tilbury. Advanta, a German investment
group, holds a further 14 per cent. Holzmann and Girozentrale will take a 33
per cent stake in the venture.
The sale price of the two adjacent properties, The Phoenix Development and
St James' Business Park in Glasgow, is understood to be about Pounds 27m.
The sites comprise 300 acres for which planning permission has been granted
for a mixture of business, retail and industrial parks as well as for fast
food and hotel facilities.
Tilbury will retain a 67 per cent interest in the venture which will be
included as a subsidiary in its group accounts.
Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive of Tilbury, said: 'The joint venture
strengthens our partnership with Holzmann. As well as being our largest
shareholder, Holzmann has indicated their support in a number of projects we
are considering - including the Novosur property joint venture in Madrid.'

businesses.
The shares fell 1p to 1 1/2 p.

Holmes, which had extended the closing date for the deal by 90 days for
Alert to find financing, hoped to realise Dollars 17.5m-Dollars 18.5m from

The group had planned to use the proceeds to repay part of its Dollars 61m

Last month the group's accounts were qualified by its auditors subject to
the company's ability to continue as a going concern.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: GKN plans French joint venture in AFV
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATIONALISATION of the European armoured fighting vehicles market
accelerated yesterday as GKN Defence, the UK-based defence subsidiary of
GKN, and Giat Industries of France announced a possible joint-venture in the
medium armoured vehicle market.
The two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the
feasibility of common solutions for the French and British markets. The
agreement, if successful, could secure GKN's future as a manufacturer of
armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs).
'With manufacturers as diverse as GKN, VSEL, USH's Alvis, Royal Ordnance and
Vickers, the British AFV market is grossly oversupplied,' explains Mr Sash
Tusa, a defence analyst at Robert Fleming. 'But in the long term, this deal
could open up the continental market to GKN and provide economies of scale
for joint Franco-British manufacture.'
The move follows encouragement from Mr Alan Clark, the defence procurement
minister, for increased co-operation in acquiring defence equipment between
France and the UK. The two countries have similar requirements for equipment
which can be used outside the Nato area and which is suitable for export.
The policy's aim is to reduce procurement costs.
Giat's decision to forge links with GKN follows a nine-month flurry of
alliances and expansion since it was made an independent group by the French
government last year.
In recent months, the group has reshaped the French AFV sector by signing
joint development and manufacturing accords with the other French AFV
companies, Creusot-Loire - an engineering subsidiary of Usinor-Sacilor, the
steelmaker - and Renault Vehicules Industriels, the truck-making unit of
Renault.
Mr Pierre Chiquet, Giat's chairman, said yesterday that the accord was in
keeping with the 'pattern of Europeanising armament land programmes and
companies'.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Deadline for Chelsea FC draws closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEADLINE for Chelsea Football Club to decide whether to buy its Stamford
Bridge ground or leave it came closer to definition yesterday with the
appointment of an independent valuer.
The 11.7-acre site in Fulham Road is owned by Cabra Estates, which has been
in dispute with Chelsea's chairman Mr Ken Bates virtually since it acquired
the ground from Marler Estates in April 1989.
Mr William Wells, a partner in Chesterton, the London firm of surveyors, has
the job of determining the value of the ground in August 1988, when Chelsea
exercised an option giving it the right to buy at a price adjudicated by a
surveyor.
Mr Wells is expected to take four to six weeks to produce the valuation,
which is supposed to be binding on both parties. In March 1988 Savills,
another London firm, placed a figure of Pounds 40,000 on it, taking into
account Chelsea's tenancy (which expired in August 1989) and planning
consent for predominantly residential redevelopment. It has since been
revalued at Pounds 30m.
After Mr Wells has reached a decision, Chelsea will be given a reasonable
period - which Cabra reckons to be three months - to come up with the money.
This could, however, take the process into the next football season and Mr
John Duggan, chairman of Cabra, has indicated that he probably would not
evict the club in mid-season.
He said yesterday that he hoped the valuation would 'quickly resolve the
uncertainty that has hung over the site.'
Mr Bates was unavailable for comment.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Greenall Whitley edges up to Pounds 24.1m -
Change of name is intended to reflect change of identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENALL WHITLEY, which intends to change its name to Greenalls Group to
reflect its switch from regional brewer to national pubs and hotels
operator, yesterday reported interim pre-tax profits marginally higher at
Pounds 24.14m, against Pounds 23.74m.
Trading profit for the six months ended March 29 1991 increased by 10 per
cent to Pounds 21.25m (Pounds 19.32m) on turnover down by 7.4 per cent to
Pounds 225.5m (Pounds 243.46m).
Fully diluted earnings per share were unchanged at 12.6p but the interim
dividend is raised to 4.4p (4p).
With full provision made in last year's accounts for the brewery closures,
operating profits on pubs and brewing of Pounds 19.2m were not strictly
comparable with last year's Pounds 16.42m.
Mr Christopher Hatton, chairman, said he expected benefits from the closures
to result in a 'modest increase' over the full year.
'Trading performance in our pubs has been sustained despite the most
difficult economic conditions we have experienced in recent years,' he
added. Talks were being held with both national and regional brewers with a
view to extending and upgrading the pub estate, which was offering a wider
choice of beers to customers.
Mr Andrew Thomas, managing director, said yesterday that Pounds 25m-Pounds
30m was earmarked for this upgrading.
Operating profit on catering inns and restaurants of Pounds 2.18m (Pounds
1.9m) was adversely affected by a reduced level of activity in the
accommodation market; but the group's off-licences weathered the economic
difficulties well, raising their profit contribution to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds
1.29m).
The Gulf War and recession depressed the group's hotel trade in both the UK
and US. Operating profits were down from Pounds 8.35m in last year's buoyant
first half to Pounds 5.88m. A 5 per cent increase in room rates helped
compensate for a 6 per cent fall in occupancy.
Profit at the pre-tax level was hit by a fall in the level of property
disposals from Pounds 4.42m to Pounds 2.89m, but it benefited from a Pounds
1m reduction in interest charges on lower borrowings.
COMMENT
The trading performance of Greenall's pub estate over the half year is
flattered by the treatment of the costs of closing its breweries; but the
group appears to be getting off to a fair start on its chosen path as a pubs
and hotels operator. Management is focused on upgrading the pub estate.
Customers are already getting wider choice and margins are improving.
Despite continuing economic difficulties, improvement is also expected on
the hotels side from a combination of cost controls and sustained marketing.
Analysts do not seem inclined to quarrel with the group's claims to have
established a firm base for further progress. Full year pre-tax profits are
expected to be slightly above last year's Pounds 62.23m, with earnings per
share marginally down from 34.8p to 33.5p, putting the company on a
prospective p/e of 10.2.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Waiting for the eagle to strike again: Anheuser casts a
cautious eye on growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For more than a decade, Anheuser-Busch of the US, the world's biggest
brewer, has been expected to impose its bulky presence on the international
beer market.
Its intentions have been a constant source of speculation - most recently as
a possible bidder for Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group.
Yet, although the St Louis-based brewer produces more than 100m hectolitres
of Budweiser, Busch, and Michelob beers a year - 40m hls more than the
entire UK beer production - it exports only 3 per cent of its output.
'Our current strategy is more cautious than bold,' Mr August Busch, the
chairman, admitted in the company's recent annual report. But he added:
'Longer term, the international beer mar-ket will become a more important
source of volume and profits.' For the next few years, however, Anheuser
will concentrate on the US domestic beer market where its potential growth
is still huge. It has led the US beer industry since 1957. Last year, it
increased its share of the total US market by two points to 43.7 per cent,
with net sales worth Dollars 7.3bn (Pounds 4bn).
Anheuser now sells twice as much beer as its nearest rival, Miller Brewing,
owned by Philip Morris, the US foods and tobacco group.
The concentration of the US industry is continuing. Anheuser, Miller, and
third-ranked Adolph Coors, account for 75 per cent of the market.
In the next five years, the three groups will control 85 per cent, Mr Jerry
Ritter, Anheuser's chief financial and administrative officer, confidently
predicts.
'Anheuser is well on track to achieve its goal of a 50 per cent market share
by the mid-1990s,' he says.
Its progress towards that priority target appears relentless. First-quarter
sales this year suggest that Anheuser has taken a doubling of excise tax on
beer in its stride, just as it coped with last year's price discounting by
competitors.
Its interests in theme parks, food products, can manufacturing and baseball
 -the company owns the St Louis Cardinals - do not distract from its
commitment to brewing.
Its brand marketing is aggressive, sustained and richly funded. Last year,
it spent Dollars 613m on advertising. It has a dedicated nationwide
distribution system.
Budweiser brands account for one in every three beers sold in the US. More
than half the country's 80m beer drinkers aged between 21 and 27 years are
Bud consumers.
Anheuser has also not been afraid to innovate. Bud Dry Draft, a beer with
less sugar and no aftertaste was launched nationally last year and sold 3m
barrels. The beer was judged one of the most successful new product
introductions in the industry's history, even though some of its sales were
gained from other Budweiser brands. This year, Anheuser is test marketing
two new Michelob brands. 'We are developing new products to meet new tastes
and segmenting the market further,' says Mr Ritter.
With US brewers such as Stroh and Heileman losing share and the beer market
still growing, if slowly, Mr Ritter calculates that there will be up to 5m
barrels a year of new business to be won up to the middle of the decade.
Against that background, he says: 'There is no great sense of urgency about
plunging into high-risk areas overseas.' For the moment, at least, there is
no inclination to change tactics by striking boldly to capture a brewer such
as Allied-Lyons.
'We are quite willing to make investments in brewing assets abroad,' says Mr
Ritter, 'so long as we can maintain our pattern of seeking a fair return on
capital for shareholders.'
The 'outrageous' prices paid over recent years for UK and European breweries
would make that impossible.
'There will be opportunities later to buy assets, if necessary, at
reasonable prices,' he suggests.
Anheuser's international progress so far has been made mainly through
licensing agreements with national brewers. These include Suntory in Japan,
its largest export market, GrandMet in the UK, Guinness in Ireland, Labatt
in Canada, Carlsberg in Denmark, and Oriental Brewing in South Korea.
Such agreements have generally worked well. Budweiser is the leading
international brand in Japan with 60 per cent of the category.
In Canada, it has captured 4 per cent of the beer market. Sales in Ireland
grew 52 per cent last year; and in the UK, which accounts for 80 per cent of
its European sales of 657,000 hls annually, Budweiser is one of the fastest
growing premium lagers.
The licensed brewers take a large share of the profits, however, and the
uncertainties of such agreements was illustrated by the acquisition of Grand
Metropolitan's breweries this year by Courage, the UK's second-largest
brewer. Mr Ritter confesses that this deal, which put Anheuser's Budweiser
in the same portfolio as its US rival's Miller Lite, has caused 'very great
concern'.
Anheuser is discussing the situation with Courage and seems to have decided
that, because of Miller's different positioning as a standard lager, it may
be able to live with the arrangement.
Courage, however, will have to provide some guarantees. 'The key factor,'
says Mr Ritter, 'is the amount of attention that our brand will get. We have
to ensure that it does not come to be seen as just one in a herd of premium
lagers.'
Anheuser sees 'great opportunities' for the future in the UK and continental
Europe as the brewing industry restructures, trade barriers come down, and
former communist states move to market-based economies.
It is optimistic about resolving its long-standing trademark dispute with
Czechoslovakia's Budweiser brewery and perhaps developing some form of joint
venture.
To strengthen its position in Europe generally, Anheuser established its own
sales, distribution, and marketing organisation covering 17 countries last
year.
European sales volumes promptly rose 20 per cent. Budweiser is now listed by
all the UK's leading brewers, and the foundations for future growth have
been reinforced by its introduction into Greece, Sweden and Belgium.
'By moving slowly, we have gained knowledge of, and experience in, foreign
markets without tying up significant capital,' says Mr Ritter.
'We feel confident that we now know the market inside out,' he adds. Bullish
words, perhaps, but competitors may well detect an ominous note.

almost three months to take over its US competitor, Square D, following a
12.5 per cent improvement to Dollars 2.23bn (Pounds 1.29bn) in the value of
its bid.
The French company said yesterday that it had reached agreement with Square
D on an offer of Dollars 88 a share. This compares with Schneider's initial
offer of Dollars 78 a share, and represents an increase of Dollars 250m in
the overall value of the deal.
Square D's management has fought bitterly against the Schneider bid since it
was launched in February, but it was forced to negotiate after the US
Department of Justice announced last Friday that it had no anti-trust
objections to the deal.
The government's decision was believed to be an indication that Square D
would lose its legal battle against the merger. It was pressing an
anti-trust lawsuit in a US District Court in New York, which has now been
withdrawn.
Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, Schneider's chairman, immediately flew to New
York with his bankers, Lazard Freres, to meet Mr Jerre Stead, chairman of
Square D, and his advisers, Goldman Sachs.
Square D will now drop its lawsuits against Schneider, which will withdraw
the list of candidates it had put up against the current board.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne said yesterday that the deal would create one of the
world's leading groups in the production of low- and medium-tension
electrical distribution equipment, and would also considerably strengthen
his group's position in the field of industrial robots.
He said that the additional Dollars 10 a share was justified by the
successful conclusion of a friendly agreement, as well as by the improvement
in economic conditions in the US.
'At Dollars 88, the price works out at 19.2 times 1990 earnings per share,
where the market values the sector at an average of 18.9 times. On book
value, we are paying 2.8 times book, compared with a sector average of 2.6.
In other words, we are buying the company in dollars at the market price,
without a control premium,' he said.
The cost of the takeover will be funded half from money provided by
Schneider and by its subsidiaries Merlin Gerin and Telemecanique, and half
by a bank loan provided by Societe Generale and Paribas.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Berlin's back against the wall: The struggle to create a
European aviation centre and an east-west gateway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pigeons still fly and nest in the large aircraft hangar at the run-down
airport of Schoenefeld in what used to be East Berlin.
Although Lufthansa has spent DM20m (Pounds 6.7m) modernising the old hangar
to turn it into a maintenance base for Boeing 737 jets, the airline has so
far failed to remove all the pigeons. The investment reflects both the
ambitions and difficulties of Lufthansa, which, in the words of its chairman
Mr Heinz Ruhnau, wants to transform Berlin into 'a new centre of European
aviation and a gateway between east and west', following the unification of
the two Germanys.
Lufthansa returned to Berlin last October after a 45-year absence. It was an
emotional moment. The airline was founded in Berlin in 1926. After the
second world war, it was shut out from its home base with only the allied
airlines, including British Airways, Air France and Pan American, allowed to
use the three air corridors between Berlin and what was West Germany.
The German flag carrier has wasted little time in re-establishing itself in
Berlin. 'From zero, we now operate 286 weekly flights into Berlin,' said Mr
Ruhnau, whose successor as Lufthansa chairman is expected to be announced
tomorrow. But the euphoria has been tempered by the practical difficulties
of the reunification process and, in the case of Lufthansa, of recreating a
base in the city.
Schoenefeld is just one example. 'The hangar was in a dreadful state,' said
Mr Karl-Friedrich Rausch, Lufthansa's manager for aircraft maintenance in
Berlin. He was walking around the maintenance plant which, until this year,
was used by Interflug, the former East German airline which has just stopped
its scheduled flights. 'We called in the Rentokil people but there are still
some pigeons left,' he added.
But the pigeons are the least of Lufthansa's worries in trying to expand its
operations. The airline was planning to use Schoenefeld to launch new
international services from Berlin because there was no room for expansion
at the congested airport of Tegel in the former western part of the city.
'We started a service to New York this year but were forced to drop it. No
one wanted to fly from Schoenefeld because of the state of the airport,'
explained a Lufthansa official. Plans to improve and modernise Schoenefeld
are in limbo. Mr Ruhnau is now campaigning for the construction of an
airport 30 miles south of Berlin on the site of the present Soviet military
air base of Sperenberg. This would provide the necessary infrastructure to
meet the expected growth in air travel demand in the Berlin area. Even if he
succeeds in persuading the authorities, it will take years to build the
airport.
Berlin's problem is acute. At present Tegel handles nearly 7m passengers a
year, while Schoenefeld serves about 3m passengers largely with flights
operated by east European carriers. 'By the year 2005, we expect demand in
Berlin to rise to about 30m,' Mr Ruhnau said. 'Tegel could be enlarged but
because it is in the middle of the city it cannot be expanded to handle more
than 7m passengers a year. Schoenefeld could be expanded to serve 12m to 13m
passengers a year but faces big problems. Berlin basically needs a new
airport.'
But it is not only the lack of adequate new airport capacity which risks
clipping Lufthansa's ambitions. The current state of disarray of the Soviet
and east European economies is expected to delay the development of
east-west air travel.
As the national flag carrier, Lufthansa faces the additional political
pressure of helping to provide employment and new economic opportunities for
former East Germans. 'The wall has come down but a new economic poverty wall
has been erected between the rich west and the poor eastern side,' said a
member of the Berlin Senate.
Mr Ruhnau originally proposed to acquire a 26 per cent stake in Interflug
and to absorb it gradually into the Lufthansa family. But the Treuhand, the
body charged with selling or closing east German companies, as well as the
German cartel office were opposed to the deal because they feared it would
give Lufthansa a monopoly in Berlin.
British Airways also showed an interest in buying a large stake in Interflug
to help preserve its position in the Berlin market after unification. But BA
was never able to see the Interflug accounts to help it decide whether to
make such an investment. Instead BA, now facing intense competition from
Lufthansa on internal German airline services, plans to form a new
German-based airline with German banks and other financial institutions.
Lufthansa was not prepared to wait for the Treuhand to change its mind and
allow it to buy a stake in Interflug. It decided to develop its new Berlin
hub alone. It bought for Dollars 150m the internal German services of Pan
Am, the US carrier desperate for cash; negotiated a new agreement with Air
France to take over the management of the joint Euro-Berlin airline
subsidiary set up three years ago under French control to offer flights out
of Berlin; and launched a series of services to Germany and other
international destinations.
The airline has hired almost 1,000 former Interflug employees, including 450
at its Schoenefeld maintenance facility, to staff its Berlin operations.
'I'm not responsible for Interflug but we have always tried to help the
people of Interflug,' Mr Ruhnau said. But with the demise of the former East
German airline, Lufthansa is being pressed to hire more Interflug employees.
Interflug was heavily over-staffed like other East German enterprises. ' All
East German companies had two chains of employment. One was the management,
the other the party,' said Mr Ruhnau. 'At Interflug there were four chains:
a secret service chain and an army chain as well.'
More than 6,000 people were employed by Interflug. There are still about
2,800 who have yet to find new jobs. This includes 215 pilots. 'I don't know
how it will be possible to retrain these pilots to fly western aircraft,' Mr
Ruhnau said. However, Lufthansa has just set up a company to help retrain
Interflug employees with the backing and funding of Germany's national
employment organisation.
'The company will make an offer to all employees still with Interflug to get
new qualifications to give them a better chance of finding a job in the
airline or service-related industries. If air traffic in Berlin picks up and
we have a demand for additional people, newly qualified Interflug employees
will get priority,' Mr Ruhnau explained.
Despite the enormous economic uncertainties facing the fledgling eastern
democracies, and the current turmoil in the airline industry, Mr Ruhnau is
convinced Lufthansa's strategy of expanding in both east and west Europe
will ultimately pay off. He expects the east-west European airline market to
show higher than average growth over the next 20 years, of 10.4 per cent a
year, compared with about 5-6 per cent for the industry as a whole.
'We are already the market leader and we will strengthen our position
because all these countries are our neighbours and Germany already offers
the majority of airline seats to east Europe,' he said. Lufthansa is now
discussing close co-operation with LOT, the Polish airline, and an agreement
is expected this summer.
Mr Ruhnau has a long-term vision. 'The old expression of eastern and western
Europe will disappear in a few years,' he said. 'Before the war we had a
continental Europe or rather a middle Europe which was a source of great
wealth. This will appear again and Berlin will be in the middle of it.'
'Look,' he added, 'Czechoslovakia once had the highest living standard in
Europe. This will come again. History and tradition are much more important
than some short-term thinking. All this opens new opportunities for
Lufthansa.'
Most of his own senior managers are more cautious. At present, 90 per cent
of Berlin traffic is domestic German traffic, explained Mr Klaus Nittinger,
the head of Lufthansa's passenger services. The international network out of
Berlin remains weak. 'The growth of this network will be gradual. The west
Berlin population is only 2m and cannot generate enough traffic to create a
big market. The surrounding market is still pretty weak because the money is
not there,' he added.
But Mr Ruhnau believes he will confound the sceptics once more. At his
company's annual meeting in Berlin in 1984, he was ridiculed for saying:
'The day will come when Lufthansa will again fly to an undivided Berlin.'
Even if his latest prediction proves correct, Mr Ruhnau, who will be
retiring next year, will leave a formidable task for his successor.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: The enterprise culture in Paraguay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTONIO ESPINOZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is so seldom that Paraguay gets press coverage in Britain, that it
is disappointing that your correspondent Christina Lamb gives your readers a
rather distorted view of my country in her article, 'Paraguay finds old
habits die hard', (May 9).
Street vendors do hawk French perfumes and Japanese electronics, but should
one presume they are contraband? Smuggling had been endemic during the
Stroessner regime, and one of the first measures of the new government of
president Rodriguez was to cut the tariffs on these and most other consumer
luxuries to 7 per cent - removing the incentive to smuggle, and practically
ending the illegal import of these goods.
The high tariff barriers of our neighbours do, naturally, make shopping in
Paraguay very attractive, generating an important regional tourist trade.
This has helped to sustain our growth rate in spite of the major adjustments
that have had to be made as state subsidies and other forms of government
intervention are removed from the economy.
In fact, the World Bank estimates our gross domestic product growth for 1990
at 5.1 per cent, not the zero growth stated in your article.
Of course the after-effects of 35 years of autocratic rule cannot be wished
away, and the struggle to perfect our democratic institutions, our human
rights record and the liberal-isation of the economy continues. Gigantic
strides in this direction have already been made, and we shall persist.
My government remains as committed as ever to supporting the creative forces
of free enterprise in a truly democratic environment.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: No car, but a better pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From B F BERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte analysis of the alternative ways of
funding cars for employees (Management, May 10) appears to have overlooked
one significant cost in the case of an increased salary. This salary would
almost certainly be pensionable and so would require contributions in the
order of 15 per cent. If the pension scheme were contributory, some cost
would fall on the employee, for which tax relief would be available.
However, the bulk of the cost, upwards of 10 per cent of salary, would fall
on the employer, considerably reducing the alleged net gain to the employer
as shown. To the employee, the substitution of a car by a salary increase
must be an added attraction if it also enhances the pension.

   From Mr BRUCE SCOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to Observer's comments about the government decision to
move the Department of Employment's key policy unit for small firms to
Sheffield ('Faraway Faceless', May 3), his obvious bias against the north
does him no credit.
The decision to move any government department out of the over-crowded and
over-rated south is to be welcomed. Here in the north-west, our only regret
is that the decision did not involve Stockport or Preston or Chester or
Blackburn. Despite emotive words such as 'exile' the lifestyle north of
Watford can only be described as excellent.
On his implied concern about the potential communication difficulties
between government departments and ministers, distance has never struck me
as a problem. The 'Sir Humphrey' syndrome seems more apposite and that
happens whatever the distance.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: Stabilisation in new democracies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms STEPHANY GRIFFITH-JONES and Mr JOHN TOYE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf's article, 'Poland's struggle for stability', (May 9)
raises many interesting issues for stabilisation policy. But his claim that
the success of stabilisation and authoritarian regimes are causally linked
is highly dubious.
It runs counter not only to the views of the World Bank and the ESRD, but
also to the results of academic social science. Haggard and Kauffman at
Harvard found established democracies to be no less prudent in
macro-management than authoritarian regimes. One of us has just participated
in a nine-country study which rejected authoritarianism as a necessary
condition for good structural adjustment (Aid and Power, Routledge, 1991).
A good example of a new democracy managing stabilisation well is Chile. The
Aylwin government's inflation forecast for 1991 of 15 per cent seems to us
realistic - and it is well below the 25 per cent prevailing during the last
years of the Pinochet government.
Martin Wolf's economic analysis is good enough to need no support from
half-baked political science.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: Sacred Symphony - Sadler's Wells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oliver Hindle is the newest choreographer to emerge
from the Royal Ballet. A young dancer with the Birmingham troupe, he has
made some workshop essays, and on Friday night we saw the premiere of his
first professional work, Sacred Symphony. His musical text is Andrzej
Panufnik's Sinfonia sacra, a score whose clear musical voice hymns the
millennium of Polish Christianity and statehood. Hindle's concern seems with
the survival of faith in
prayer, set against imagery expressive of national
identity forged through suffering.
He begins well, with four male soloists whose leaps echo the trumpet
fanfares of Panufnik's first movement, and then brings on a group of
grieving and contemplative women. So far, so brave in vision. The language
is serious, classically direct, somewhat reminiscent of Massine's symphonic
style. Jan Blake's restrained
design of two pendant banners, with the dancers
in autumnal, earthy colours, is handsome.
But the score, and the rather static inspiration behind the ballet, do not
allow much further choreographic development, and the later sections of the
piece rely too much on those ecstatic lifts and communings which MacMillan
uses so powerfully (because so intimately
allied to the language of the Mass) in Requiem. Yet Mr Hindle, speaks with
his own voice, and poetically, and
I want to see his next
works. He is well served by his cast.
The other novelty of the evening was Paul Taylor's Airs. It is good to our
national ballet essaying mainstream American dance, and Airs, with its
springy steps and evident delight in its Handel score, is an apt choice. On
Friday it was rather reverentially done - with Taylor's troupe it looks so
fresh as to be almost improvisatory - but let BRB's interpreters relax their
attitudes to it (and their torsos) and it will gain that sense of joyous
spontaneity that makes it such a delight. Marion Tait, in her solos, has the
right physical grace and happily natural air.
And to close this programme - well worth seeing - Ashton's Valses nobles and
Facade. I suppose Valses nobles should really only be given by dancers in
their late 'teens, the bloom of innocence quite as necessary to it as the
bloom of Ashton style. It is a tiny, quiet marvel, and I love watching it,
and the current cast is adept at suggesting the sudden joys (and the
evanescent shadows) of this party where the moment is very sweet. Facade
looked a bit boisterous on Friday: it needs to be treated with more dead-pan
humour and driest wit.
And for the Dago, someone as wickedly funny as Robert Helpmann must be
found, to destroy the audience with a raised eye-brow and too many diamond
rings.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: The Greek Passion - Opera Du Rhin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mulhouse, a quiet town in southern Alsace where the Opera du Rhin has just
been presenting Martinu's The Greek Passion, is far from the madding cry of
international opera. The theatre, a perfectly-scaled building tucked down a
little street off the town centre, was built in 1887 and lovingly restored
for its centenary. The town has its own part-time orchestra, and
performances tend to be as unpretentious as the audiences. But over the
years in this same small theatre, I've heard Alain Vainzo as a stylish
Werther, a noble Fidelio with Klaus Konig as Florestan, and the only modern
production of Massenet's Griselidis.
The fact that Martinu can be successfully played in this French provincial
backwater says something not just about local taste and the way it has been
educated by the Strasbourg-based Opera du Rhin, but also about the impact of
last year's Martinu centenary: surely no composer in the past 15 or 20 years
has benefited so much from anniversary exposure. The Greek Passion does not
exactly play itself onto the stage, but it has the simple advantage of
sincerity and conviction, qualities amply reflected in this staging. It also
has just about the most bizarre stylistic mix of any modern opera -
bitonality and polyphony, warm lyrical colours juxtaposed with harsh-toned
declamation, and a rambling, tumultuous palette of instrumental and choral
voices, unpredictably interspersed with solo accordion, piano and church
bells. Judging by reactions to last year's concert performance at the
Edinburgh Festival, the work needs the stage to make dramatic sense of these
incongruities.
Rene Terrasson's touring production, conducted with a sure, confident touch
by Robert Satanowski, was built on a versatile platform of sun-blenched
steps and rocks, designed by Isabel Echarri and Diego Etcheverry. The
costumes evoked a contemporary Greek atmosphere, while the ragged appearance
of the refugee intruders could not help but bring to mind the current plight
of the Kurds and the moral dilemmas they have provoked. And that is surely
one of Martinu's prime purposes in this village drama-cum-Easter oratorio:
to ask timeless, universal questions about public and personal morality,
probing the gap between our earthly and spiritual selves.
Tibere Raffalli, as the shepherd Manolios who pays for his goodness with his
life, sang with dignity and a warm Mediterranean timbre. Jean-Marie Fremeau,
a commanding figure with an equally commanding bass-baritone voice, made a
convincing Grigoris, the hypocritical village priest. Chantal Dubarry was a
wholly sympathetic Katerina, and Remy Corazza acted the part of the pedlar
Yannakos with appealing simplicity. The chorus sounded unexpectedly
well-schooled, and Michel Ancey's French translation sang easily. The only
quirk of the evening was a brief spoken introduction and epilogue on tape,
which - far from detracting from Martinu's original - further illuminated
its meaning.

That bugbear of mankind, religious doctrine, is rearing its ugly head again
in India, a country where competing fantasies about the supernatural have
proved just as murderously dangerous as in Ireland or the Middle East.
Voting in the Indian elections begins next week and the anti-Moslem BJP is
expected to make the biggest gains. It wants to turn India into a Hindu
rather than a secular state and the country's 160 million Moslems are
alarmed. Brian Barron reports for Assignment (7.45 BBC2).
As with postage stamps and the industrial revolution, England led the rest
of Europe when it came to replacing the divine right of kings with socialist
ideals: the Diggers and Levellers of the mid 17th century would have had
little to learn from Lenin or the French egalitarians. The fourth of C4's
Civil War series concentrates on the radical ideas of the period. A new six
part drama series with Brenda Blethyn is a pleasant thought. In All Good
Things (9.30) she plays a mother with two teenage sons whose life changes
with the arrival of an unplanned baby. That is followed (10.20) by a profile
of the Romanian dictator, Ceausescu - Behind The Myth, from journalist
Edward Behr.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: The Black Rider - Berlin Theatre Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To kill your wife in a shooting accident is one thing; to turn the episode
into a musical would seem, gall aside, to invite theatrical fiasco in the
worst of taste. Add lyrics that slide between German and English, a set that
crosses von Sternberg with a western, rock music with fairground honky-tonk,
and disaster looks assured.
So it is with reluctant but moonstruck admiration that I report The Black
Rider (text: William Burroughs) as the star of the Berlin Theatre Festival
(to May 20) and one of the most delightful, inventive, profound and
originally musical musicals composed; a fitting - self-consciously so -
successor to those other mythical English-German concoctions, The Threepenny
Opera and Cabaret.
The Black Rider overlays the modern legend of Burroughs, the Beatnik junkie
who shot his wife, with the old tale of the village clerk who has to pass
muster as marksman before he can marry the gamekeeper's daughter. He makes a
pact in 'silver bullets' with the devil but on his wedding day Satan betrays
him and he shoots dead not the targetted white dove but his wife. This was
the story, converted to a happy ending, of Weber's Der Freischutz. Now
Burroughs, the Texan director and stage designer Robert Wilson, and rock
composer Tom Waits, have reworked the original into a contemporary version.
Other myths get woven in. Wilson's devil is a sleek Master of ceremonies in
whiplash tails who croons the Cabaret welcome 'So come on in/it ain't no
sin/take off your skin/and dance around in your bones'. He introduces the
cast, his 'devil's band', as they step one by one out of a black felt
sentry-box.
For three hours of graceful, cold artifice, they look, act and sound like
figures from the silent movies: movements abrupt, irregular, too fast, too
slow, as if wound up by a shaky hand projector; chalk-white, bony faces,
blackened eye sockets, lips thickened into permanent red pouts. Every image
is ice-hard: hair pulled back crisp or standing up in spikes, clothes
exagerating bodies with jagged collars, razor pleats, square and rectangular
dresses.
The set continues the theme; Wilson turns children's drawings into
three-dimensional monstrosities. Crooked chairs, two metres high, dangle at
odd angles along with a huge frame whose broken glass juts into the flesh of
its 'living' picture, the gamekeeper's ancestor (Heinz Fossbrink). Pine
trees are scissor cut-outs which collapse and grow again like cartoons,
illuminated sugar pink and lime green against a black forest. Large or small
scale, Wilson is a master of spectacle: the clerk William and his Katchen
floating above the stage for a duet as the great neon sign of a gun descends
before them; the white stockinged leg in red stiletto that appears out of a
slit in the black sentrybox, image of naivety, severity, brittle romance.
Best of all, the whole, the sustained dramatic unity of the vision, is
greater than the sum of its parts. Tom Waits' sarcastic ballads, full of
folk and blues and rock, call back the scarred idealism and mock simplicity
of Kurt Weill, while Burroughs' monosyllabic banality has here found the
setting which makes it seem perfect.
Nursery rhyme humour marries English with German, while Hollywood kitsch
rolls into Teutonic romanticism. Wilson's cast bop and strut and beat out
the mesmeric rhythms in husky tempting voices. The devil (Dominique Horwitz)
has the best tunes, and mocks us for loving them. In 'Last Rose of Summer'
he picks a flower from the floor, affects a tear, disappears into his box
and, inside it, hovers up to the roof of the stage.
Annette Paulmann and Stefan Kurt, as Katchen and William, screech like
vultures and sing like angels. She plays an imaginary piano and draws
patterns in the air as she sings the breathless lyric 'I'll shoot the moon
right out of the sky for you, baby'; he dances a ballet of despair, shock
and loss breaking through his wax face, before rallying with 'I'll be back
on some lucky day'. This production returns to Hamburg's Thalia Theatre
after Berlin, with a stop in Amsterdam on May 14-16. So far plans for a
London visit have not materialised, but this is a show worth a plane ticket.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The wrong price on an invoice is the most common cause of delayed payments,
according to a survey of 400 companies carried out by Resource Evaluation
(REL), a specialist consultancy. Incorrect pricing accounted for 30 per cent
of delayed payments by value.
The other main reasons for delayed payments - some of which are used
deliberately by customers to conserve their own cash flow - were requests
for copies of documents (16 per cent by value); administrative errors (15
per cent); requests for proof of delivery (14 per cent) and shortages of the
items required (6 per cent).
Companies make insufficient use of measurement techniques to assess how good
they are at collecting their money, REL says.
At least one company surveyed produced one credit note for every seven
invoices, a figure which indicated that it had to replace or rework a
significant amount of goods supplied and that it was probably already in
serious trouble.
REL surveyed companies with outstanding sales ledger balances of between
Pounds 2m and Pounds 302m. The average outstanding sum owed to the companies
surveyed was Pounds 14.6m, of which on average 35 per cent was subject to

FT  14 MAY 91 / Management: Self-help takes off from the flat-lands - The
application of community bonds in Saskatchewan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any effort to lure new industry to rural Saskatchewan runs the risk of
ending up as more of a repellent than a magnet.
Far away from North America's main markets, the farming towns which dot the
Canadian prairies are best known for their pancake-flat scenery and numbing
winters.
But in their quest for diversification, these remote communities have hit on
a novel way to tempt small and mid-sized businesses into setting up or
expanding on their doorstep.
Their bargaining chip is a scheme of government-sponsored 'community bonds'.
Launched last year, the bonds are designed to mobilise equity for local
enterprises, using the sizeable amounts of money which frugal prairie
townsfolk and farmers have up to now squirrelled away in low-risk bank
deposits and blue-chip shares.
Several businesses have already taken the bait. Trinitral International, a
small maker of telephone sets, expects to open a 17-person assembly and
packaging facility next month in the south-east Saskatchewan town of
Melville (population 5,000).
Melville's Community Bond Corporation raised CDollars 250,000 from local
residents late last year, giving it a 25 per cent stake in Trinitral. Other
shareholders are a provincial government agency, the company's managers and
Dorart Industries, a Singapore company which will supply kits and know-how
to Trinitral.
In the town of Kindersley, near the Saskatchewan-Alberta border, a newly
formed community bond corporation hopes to rake in CDollars 500,000 over the
next month or two. The money will be invested in Rotary Airforce, which is
developing a slow-moving type of helicopter suitable for crowd control and
pipeline inspections.
Rotary's existing R&amp;D operation is currently occupying aircraft hangars near
Edmonton, in neighbouring Alberta. The infusion of equity from community
bonds has led the company to set up its manufacturing facility in
Kindersley.
Over 60 towns have registered community bond corporations in the past year.
Three financings have been completed, while ten other bond offerings are
currently under way. Other project companies include a maker of combine
harvester attachments and a pea-chip processing plant.
Some communities plan to use the corporations like mutual funds, first
raising money and then searching for one or more businesses which they would
like to have in town.
The key to the scheme is a guarantee provided by the provincial government
on the principal amount of the bonds. In other words, local investors stand
to lose no more than the interest, dividends or capital gains which might
have accrued elsewhere.
Even with this safeguard, however, the community bond scheme is fraught with
risks. At least some of the businesses will almost certainly fail, which
could leave the government with sizeable financial obligations, and local
communities with the political and economic scars of a serious misadventure.
Some community bond corporations, designed as vehicles for 'people's
capitalism', may have difficulty functioning as sophisticated shareholders.
Many of the directors are neophytes in economic development. The 12-member
Kindersley corporation, for instance, includes a local dentist and a farmer.
Each board must also appoint a 'youth director' under the age of 18.
There is a nagging suspicion in some quarters that the provincial
government, facing an election later this year, has launched the scheme with
an eye on popular appeal rather than sound commercial practice. One observer
notes that 'there is quite a lot of nervousness among those close to the
process, compared with the euphoria of the politicians who are touting it'.
Despite these potential stumbling blocks, Dale Botting, regional manager for
the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, thinks the scheme is worth
a try. He expects that the government's total liability to holders of
community bonds will turn out to be far lower than the millions of dollars
which it has poured into extravagant projects over the years.
'The real value of this may be to shore up the equity of businesses already
in the community and to encourage an entrepreneurial culture,' Botting says.
For instance, Trinitral was able to get sufficient bank financing for its
telephone set business only after it came up with the extra equity provided
by community bonds.
Among other spin-offs, residents who volunteer to sell community bonds
receive a short training course in the basics of investing in a small
business. Students at the Saskatch-ewan College of Commerce can obtain
course credits by helping with administrative work in the corporations.
Rick Dillabaugh, Kindersley's economic development officer, acknowledges
that many of the bond-financed ventures will fail. But he contends that 'if
you don't go out and try, you won't get the good ones either. This puts the
destiny of the community into its own hands. They can choose what direction
they want to take.'
The proceeds of bond sales are normally invested in a company's preferred
shares, convertible into common stock after three to five years. In that
way, holders can benefit from increased dividends and capital gains, if
there are any. Bond corporations have a right to nominate directors to the
boards of project companies proportionate to their equity stakes.
The province is well aware of the risk that the scheme could degenerate into
a gravy train for dubious ventures. Community bond corporations are
encouraged to hire a reputable accountant or lawyer to help them sift
through project proposals. Every investment must also be approved by a
six-member provincial review committee, comprising two business lawyers, a
former head of the provincial finance department, and three economic
development experts.
Graham Parsons, a government economist who claims credit for devising the
scheme and is now in charge of implementing it, reckons that the best
safeguard is the board of directors of the bond corporations themselves.
'These people will be in the community for the next 10-20 years,' Parsons
says. 'They have a significant responsibility to be fair and reasonable to
others in the community.'

FT  14 MAY 91 / Management: Controversy over Canada's loans policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada is searching for ways to breathe vigour into a popular federal
loan-guarantee programme for budding entrepreneurs which makes use of the
extensive resources of the country's financial institutions.
Over CDollars 7.7bn has been disbursed to about 285,000 businesses since the
inception of the Small Business Loans Act (SBLA) programme 30 years ago. In
the year to March 1990, 13,800 loans were made with a value of CDollars
539m.
(The British government, meanwhile, has commissioned a review of the UK's
equivalent Loan Guarantee Scheme. This programme, which provides a 70 per
cent guarantee, has backed 27,900 loans worth Pounds 890m since 1981.)
The SBLA's greatest strength, but one which is also turning out to be a
serious weakness, is the role of financial institutions in administering the
scheme. The loans are advanced by banks, trust companies and credit unions -
institutions that have branch networks and credit assessment skills which
the government could not hope to match.
Ottawa's role is to provide a guarantee on up to 85 per cent of the loan,
with the financial institution taking the risk on the remaining 15 per cent.
All loans must be secured, either by business or personal assets.
The loans can be used to finance up to 90 per cent of land and premises
costs, and 80 per cent of equipment costs, up to a CDollars 100,000 limit.
Only companies with annual sales of less than CDollars 2m are eligible.
Banks are obliged to charge an interest rate equal to one percentage point
over bank prime rate, currently at 10 per cent in Canada. This compares with
a typical rate for commercial loans of two or three points above prime.
The scheme appears to have made a sizeable contribution in spawning new
enterprises. Almost 40 per cent of the SBLA loans made last year were for
start-ups, while 60 per cent were for businesses less than three years old.
A study commissioned by the Canadian Bankers Association says that about 15
per cent of small-business loans are covered by an SBLA guarantee.
But the volume of loans has slowed markedly in the past few years. Last
year's total number of 13,800 was 22 per cent down on 1989. One reason is
the recession. But the banks, more concerned than ever with their lending
margins, also object to being forced to make loans at the set rate of prime
plus 1 per cent.
The banks have come to see SBLA loans as something of a loss leader; they
consider the chief benefit to be the other business they may generate from
the borrowing company, its owners or its employees.
Michael Hanly, director of small business loans in the Department of
Industry, Science and Technology, says that banks are increasingly taking
loans onto their own books which might in the past have been channelled
through the SBLA. 'We've got to make it more attractive for the banks,' he
says.
Among the changes now under consideration are a more flexible interest-rate
structure (including perhaps, a service fee for the banks), and a higher
loan ceiling.
The 88,000-member Canadian Federation for Independent Business is pressing
for other adjustments, too. It suggests that the guarantee and interest-rate
formula could be tailored for specific groups of entrepreneurs, such as
women or disadvantaged minority groups.
In return for market-related interest charges, the CFIB wants the banks to
cut back their personal security requirements. 'Our experience is that, even
on conventional loans, the banks over-demand on collateral,' says Brian
Gray, the CFIB's senior vice-president. The chances of the banks agreeing to
that however, are small.

FT  14 MAY 91 / FT Law Report: Japanese formulae do not disclose patent
method
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RE ASAHI KASEI KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA House of Lords (Lord Keith of Kinkel,
Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, Lord Ackner, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton and Lord
Jauncey of Tullichettle): May 9 1991
A GENETIC engineering patent claim is not deprived of novelty at its
priority date by an earlier application on another patent published before
or after that date disclosing the formulae by which the relevant chemical
compounds are created, if the earlier application makes no enabling
disclosure in that it fails to disclose the method by which the formulae are
to be applied in producing the compounds.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by Asahi Kasei Kogyo
Kabushiki Kaisha, from a Court of Appeal decision upholding a determination
of the comptroller of patents that a patent application by Asahi lacked
novelty at its priority date.
Section 2 of the Patents Act 1977 provides: '(1) An invention shall be taken
to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art.
(2) The state of the art in the case of an invention shall be taken to
comprise all matter . . . which has at any time before the priority date of
that invention been made available to the public.
(3) The state of the art in the case of an invention . . . shall be taken
also to comprise matter contained in an application for another patent which
was published on or after the priority date of that invention, if . . . (a)
that matter was contained in the application for that other patent . . . and
(b) the priority date of that matter is earlier than that of the invention'.
LORD OLIVER said that the appeal arose from competing applications for
patents for chemical inventions in the field of genetic engineering.
A Japanese company, Dainippon, filed application JP 617 in Japan on March 6
1984. On April 6 1984 Asahi filed an application in the US. On February 26
1985 Dainippon filed application EP 549 in the European Patents Office
claiming priority from JP 617. Asahi filed UK 864 on April 4 1985 claiming
priority from the US application of April 6 1984. For the purposes of the
appeal it was assumed that the subject matter of claims 2 and 3 of UK 864
was matter disclosed in EP 549, and that EP 549 adequately described a
method of preparing the products of those claims.
It was also assumed that the earliest EP 549 priority document (ie, JP 617)
disclosed the products of claims 2 and 3 of UK 864, but did not describe any
preparation methods.
The question, on those assumptions, was whether, having regard to the JP 617
disclosure, the subject matter of claims 2 and 3 of UK 864 formed part of
the state of the art under section 2 of the Patents Act 1977 at the UK 864
priority date, so as to deprive those claims of novelty.
The question arose between Asahi and the comptroller of patents on
examination of the application in suit, the UK 864 application.
On February 16 1988 the superintending examiner determined that EP 549
formed part of the state of the art at the UK 864 priority date and thus
anticipated claims 2 and 3.
EP 549 was not published until September 1985, after the UK 864 priority
date, so the examiner's decision was based on section 2(3) of the act and JP
617 priority.
Asahi argued that for disclosure in an application to form part of the state
of the art under section 2(3), it had to disclose the method of working the
invention, ie, it had to be an 'enabling disclosure'. It said mere
disclosure of a formula for a compound claimed was not sufficient.
That argument was rejected by the superintending examiner. Mr Justice
Falconer dismissed Asahi's appeal. The Court of Appeal upheld that
dismissal. Asahi now appealed.
The first question was, what material in EP 549 was entitled to the priority
date of JP 617? The second question was whether that material anticipated
the claims of the application in suit, having regard to the provisions of
section 2.
Section 5(2)(a) of the act provided that if an invention to which an
application related was 'supported by matter disclosed' in an earlier
application, the invention priority date should be the date of filing the
earlier application. By section 5(2)(b) the priority date of 'any matter
contained in the application in suit' was to be the date of filing the
earlier application in which 'that matter was disclosed'.
The act did not contain any definition of 'supported', but some assistance
could be obtained from section 14(5) which required the claim in an
application to be 'supported' by the description.
That must involve the conclusion that if the specification description did
not enable the claim to be established, it could not be said to 'support'
it, for the act could hardly have contemplated a complete application for a
patent lacking some of the material necessary to sustain the claims made.
It followed that a description in an earlier application which contained no
enabling disclosure would not 'support' the invention so as to enable it to
claim priority from the date of that application under section 5(2)(a),
although the description would be entitled to a priority as 'matter
contained' in the application in suit under section 5(2)(b).
What was claimed was a chemical compound formula produced in accordance
with, and identified by reference to, the formula disclosed.
The invention was not the formula itself but the thing identified and
described in terms of chemical building blocks by reference to the formula
of its compositions.
There might of course be cases where the means of producing the thing would
be self-evident to the man skilled in the art from the mere recital of the
formula or its composition, but it was not suggested that this was such a
case.
It had, therefore, to be assumed for present purposes that the man skilled
in the art, if he was to produce the invention claimed, would need to know,
not simply the formula, but a method by which it could be produced in
accordance with that formula. The invention, as a patentable concept,
involved the combination of formula and means.
It followed, Asahi argued, that EP 549 could not claim under section 5(2)(a)
priority from JP 617 for the totality of the invention claimed, but it could
claim priority from that application under section 5(2)(b) for the formulae
disclosed. So far as the means of making the invention was concerned, it
could claim priority only from the date of its own filing under section
5(1).
The logic of that argument seemed unassailable.
None of the relevant material had at priority date been published. The
critical provision was section 2(3).
In Genentech (1989) RPC 613 Mr Justice Falconer concluded that to constitute
anticipation to a claim to a new chemical compound, disclosure in a prior
document must be an enabling disclosure. In reaching that conclusion he
necessarily disapproved a contrary decision in GKI (1958) RPC 51.
For an anticipation under section 2(2) Genentech was to be preferred to GKI.
Asahi contended that the test was the same for section 2(3).
Section 2(3) deemed to be part of the state of the art nothing more than
matter entitled to priority under section 5.
Thus, the formula disclosed in JP 617 was deemed to be part of the state of
the art, but it did not follow that the invention claimed in that
application, ie, the compound produced by application of the formula, was
part of the state of the art so as to anticipate the claims made in UK 864.
The only 'matter' disclosed was the bare claim that a compound could be
prepared of the specified composition.
The appeal was allowed. The application was remitted to the Patent Office.
Their lordships agreed. Lord Jauncey gave a concurring judgment.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Technology (Technically Speaking):  Gallium arsenide comes
of age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The soul of Convex Computer's new family of supercomputers is made of
gallium arsenide (GaAs), a semiconductor compound touted as a successor to
silicon as the building material for future generations of computer chips.
Since the late 1960s semiconductor experts have debated the merits of
gallium arsenide. In theory, the material offers inherent speed and power
advantages. GaAs transistors are faster and consume less power than silicon
transistors.
Making GaAs chips has, however, proven to be far more difficult and
expensive than expected. Only a handful of the two dozen or so start-up chip
companies created in the early 1980s to exploit GaAs technology have
survived. Just last week, three of the most promising US GaAs chip makers
agreed to merge.
For Gazelle Microcircuits, Gigabit Logic and Triquint Semiconductor, the
merger represents an opportunity to form an economically viable unit
combining the best of three attempts to exploit GaAs chip technology.
Currently, GaAs devices are used primarily in military applications, where
their high speed and tolerance of high temperatures is valuable, as well as
in high-frequency communications systems.
In the far bigger market for computer chips, however, silicon reigns
supreme. The worldwide market for GaAs chips was about Dollars 260m last
year, up from Dollars 200m in 1989, according to Integrated Circuit
Engineering, a US market research firm.
Nevertheless, Convex's adoption of GaAs has provided proponents with new
hope that the technology will become pervasive.
Also spurring new interest is the need for high-speed peripheral chips to
keep up with ever-faster silicon microprocessors that are used to power PCs
and workstations.
ICE projects that the GaAs chip market will grow at an annual rate of 36 per
cent to reach Dollars 1.2bn by 1995. Today, military, aerospace and
telecommunications applications account for almost 80 per cent of GaAs chip
sales, but by the middle of the decade computer applications will be close
to half of the GaAs chip market, the market researchers predict.
If GaAs does become a commercial success then it will be in part due to the
dogged support provided by the US Defence Department. The Pentagon has been
a major source of funding for GaAs semiconductor research and development
over the past few years.
Three years ago the Defence Advance Research Projects Agency (Darpa) began
funding a research programme called Mimic (Microwave and Millimetre Wave
Monolithic Integrated Circuits) to spur development of GaAs devices for
military uses.
In a controversial move, Darpa last year provided Dollars 4m in research and
development funds to Gazelle Microcircuits, to stave off sale of the
company's technology to a foreign investor.
Established semiconductor companies, several of which participated in the
Mimic programme, are now expanding their production of GaAs devices in
anticipation of a broader market. Motorola recently announced plans to build
a Dollars 100m GaAs chip plant in Arizona, scheduled to begin production
next year of chips for commercial and military applications.
The prospects for GaAs microprocessors and memory chips remain uncertain and
the chances are that silicon will remain the pervasive semiconductor
material for these devices.
None the less, Convex's decision to 'go GaAs' marks the entry of this
technology into the 'mainstream' of the chip market. After decades of
promises, GaAs looks like a technology whose time has finally come.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Technology: Kodak's digital double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A photocopier used to be just a photocopier: but not for much longer.
The industry's largest manufacturers are about to reveal machines which act
as computer printers, scanners and even facsimile machines, as well as
perform the traditional role of copying sheets of text. The move is based on
the concept that whether you print, scan or photocopy, you are simply
replicating a series of little black squiggles between paper and computer.
Leading the field are US-parented companies such as Xerox and Kodak. Today
Kodak, which specialises in large photocopiers, will launch a copier which
replicates images digitally, rather than optically. This, the company
believes, will form the base technology around which a variety of office
applications can be built.
'At the moment we are using the machine just to copy,' says Mike Mansell,
manager of commercial and information marketing for Kodak and head of its
copy products division. 'But the interesting thing is what we do in the
future.'
Because the machine scans the document and digitises the information before
printing out the text and pictures, that digital information could, in
future, be sent over the phone.
This could lead, Mansell believes, to large photocopiers being used for an
even wider variety of tasks. While most of the bigger machines are used
today for large print runs, in future they could handle a mixture of jobs.
Further ahead they could be used in conjunction with personal computers for
manipulating text and images within a document - a computer graphic, a photo
and a piece of text could be incorporated in the same document.
Eventually Mansell envisages a situation where the Kodak machine launched
today, called the 1570, forms the hub of a company's reprographics
facilities. From there it could instruct local printer/copier units, in
different places around the country, or the world, to print documents.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LEON Brittan, the senior UK commissioner, yesterday urged the UK
government to drop its proposal for a 'hard Ecu' in favour of improving the
existing Ecu basket unit.
He did not link this with the overture by Mr Jacques Delors that Britain be
offered a let-out in the emu treaty.
The hard Ecu had proved 'politically valuable', Sir Leon said, showing that
the UK government was taking part in the Emu debate constructively. But, for
economic reasons, it had drawn little support from UK partners.
Sir Leon derided Britons who regarded the let-out on Emu as a trap or a form
of blackmail. There was no underhand deceit in the proposal, nor could be it
be considered blackmail for Britain's partners to try to make Emu such a
success that the UK would feel impelled to join.

INDUSTRY training organ-isations (ITOs), recognised by governments as the

Mr Robert Jackson, a junior employment minister, made the appeal in his
endorsement of an action plan which was the result of a study of 10 ITOs by
Manpower Research on behalf of the Department of Employment and the National
Council of Industry Training Organisations.
The study showed how ITOs could improve their effectiveness, particularly
through links with employers. It also said ITOs should set out their roles;
identify their sectors' changing skill needs; and demonstrate that 'training
pays'.
The study was part of a wider review of ITOs, the results of which will be
available in mid-1991. There are more than 100 ITOs, varying in size,
resources, membership and activity.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): TGWU drives for equal pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT TOOK 18 years and two strikes for a group of female sewing machinists at
Ford to win what they saw as a battle for equal pay with male workers. A
further seven years of battling by other female workers has failed to
eradicate what unions see as widespread sex discrimination on pay in the
motor industry.
Yesterday the TGWU general workers' union, the biggest union in car
manufacturing, launched an equal-pay drive which it said could lead to rises
of up to Pounds 1,000 for some of its 4,000 female workers in the motor
industry.
The union is backing equal-value claims for 380 women sewing machinists at
Jaguar, Vauxhall and Aston Martin. Ms Margaret Prosser, TGWU national
women's officer, said the union was actively seeking out equal-value claims
on behalf of other groups of undervalued women car workers.
She added that the average weekly pay of women in the motor industry was
Pounds 207, about 78 per cent of the rate for men. Wherever possible, the
union would try to win rises for women through job evaluation and
grade-structure reorganisations.
The dispute at Ford began in 1966 when a job evaluation scheme left sewing
machinists, mainly female, on less pay than pattern cutters, most of whom
were men. A strike that year and subsequent tribunal decisions failed to win
them higher pay. The women finally won rises in 1985 after another strike
and the setting up of an independent tribunal. Ford, however, saw it as a
grading dispute, rather than one over equal pay.
Earlier this year an independent expert was asked by a tribunal to
investigate the case of sewing machinists at Vauxhall. The claimants are
being backed by the AEU engineering union.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Few union deals at new plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS appear to have found it increasingly difficult in the past three
years to gain recognition agreements from inward investors and British
companies setting up new plants, a senior TUC official said yesterday.
Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, said only 10 deals had been
notified to the TUC since October 1988 under a procedure to regulate
inter-union conflict of the kind which led to the expulsion of the EETPU
electricians' union.
Under the prior-notification procedure, which was made permanent in June
last year after an extended trial period, unions should tell the TUC about
any single-union deal they are about to sign.
Mr Monks told a conference in London that the number of deals was 'very
small' compared with the rush of agreements signed in the mid-1980s.
This led to conflict when unions competed in 'beauty contests' for
recognition.
He said that was one reason why TUC unions supported the idea of a statutory
recognition procedure under a Labour government.
That would allow a 'step-by-step' approach to rights depending on union
membership.
Mr Monks said the TUC might switch support to establishing the size of union
membership in a company by a workforce ballot rather than by a petition
drawn up by a union.
He said that it might be 'politically advisable' to assess membership size
through a ballot in order to gain public support for the TUC's proposals.
Mr Monks said the prior-notification procedure had worked well. The final
proposals are to be approved by the TUC general council in June.

A CASH squeeze at WSK Mielec, one of Poland's biggest aircraft factories,
and one of 200 Polish plants dependent on sales to the Soviet Union, means
14,500 workers may not be paid their April wages due today, Christopher
Bobinski reports from Warsaw.
Polish officials were in Moscow yesterday for talks on finding ways of
securing payments. Poland meanwhile is paying for its purchases of Soviet
oil and gas.
The factory has in effect ceased to pay for deliveries of components from
domestic producers since Comecon countries switched to hard currency pricing
on January 1. Management has said it will no longer take delivery of them.
WSK Mielec makes AN 28 and AN 2 aircraft for the Soviet market. Last year,
it laid off 4,800 workers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEGISLATION introduced in the US House of Representatives yesterday would
require an executive block on foreign investment if it threatens to harm the
US economy.
US law partly requires the administration to block investment only if it
imperils the US national security interest. Forces in Congress are insisting
on expanding the definition of national security to include economic, not
just military, interests.
The bill sponsored by Mr Mel Levine, a California Democrat, and Mr Frank
Wolf, a Virginia Republican, reflects concern about US high-technology
companies being sold to foreign interests.
It would force the administration to include new factors before approving
sales. These involve the concentration of foreign direct investment in the
industry in question, the effect on critical technologies, and whether the
firm to be acquired has received US government funds.
The Congressmen released a report criticising the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the US (CFIUS), the inter-agency committee which vets foreign
investments. The study, by the Economic Strategy Institute, says CFIUS
reviewed only 12 of 400 critical foreign acquisitions in the past
two-and-a-half years, including 95 computer companies, 35 semiconductor
groups, 30 semiconductor equipment-makers, and 15 aerospace companies.
The legislation's backers hope to use experiences in the Gulf war to attract
support. One of the Congressmen said: 'In the Gulf conflict, without
Japanese parts for their radars, our F-16 pilots couldn't find their
targets. Imports of Japanese machine-tools have become so crucial that the
M1 Abrams Tank could not be built without them'.
The proposed legislation would transfer control of CFIUS from the US
Treasury to the commerce department. The Congressmen claimed a conflict of
interests in the Treasury's dual mission of encouraging foreign purchases of
Treasury bills and filtering out acquisitions that could harm US national
security.

JAMAICA'S economy grew 3.8 per cent last year, lifted by expansion in
agriculture, mining and manufacturing, writes Canute James in Kingston.
Mr Percival Patterson, finance minister, said the growth was achieved
despite 'adverse external shocks'. The island's economy grew 4.6 per cent in
1989. He said the agriculture sector expanded by 11.8 per cent in 1990, with
mining up 17.6 per cent and manufacturing up 4.1 per cent.
The island's trading position improved; the Dollars 724m (Pounds 420)
merchandise trade deficit was Dollars 98m less than the year-earlier
shortfall. Imports grew 1.7 per cent and exports 14.2 per cent.
Mr Patterson said public debt was Dollars 4.15bn at the end of 1990, Dollars
114m less than a year earlier.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Trade News: ECGD pressed to boost export cover for
Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) is facing mounting
pressure from industry to restore medium-term cover on export credits to
Iran, following the liberation of Kuwait and the release of Mr Roger Cooper,
the businessman held hostage in Tehran for more than five years.
Businessmen say they are concerned that without fresh cover, the UK could
lose market share in Iran to other industrial countries such as France,
Germany and Italy whose exports have been growing much faster than those of
the UK as Tehran opened up to the west. Italy has, for example, agreed to
provide Iran with Dollars 1bn (Pounds 592m) in credits for building two
power stations and other industrial projects, the Iranian News Agency IRNA
reported last week.
Even Japan, which made large losses on loans to Iraq originally extended
during the boom years of the 1970s, is now considering resuming the issue of
medium-term credit guarantees. The trading house Nissho Iwai has applied for
cover from Tokyo's Ministry of International Trade and Industry for its
share in a Dollars 450m petrochemical plant ordered earlier this year from a
consortium led by Technip of France.
ECGD, which has been under fire for its restrictive attitude on
developing-country risk, would say yesterday only that the question of cover
for Iran was 'under review'. An official could not say how long the review
would take.
Businessmen think the UK is reluctant to offer fresh cover for Iran until
British citizens held hostage in Lebanon are freed. Despite the UK embassy
re-opening in Tehran, this problem is thought to have delayed exchange of
ambassadors. On a separate issue, ECGD yesterday denied reports it was
insisting all short-term credit insurance to Kuwait be backed by irrevocable
letters of credit.
It said it had done some business on open account since liberation. This did
not involve irrevocable letters of credit, but overall volume of business
remains small, with sales treated case-by-case. Businessmen said it would be
normal for ECGD to require irrevocable letters of credit on most business
where the Kuwaiti importer was a private-sector company. It was to be
expected some importers would find it hard to establish letters of credit,
as the records of local bankers might have been lost during the Iraqi
occupation.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Estonia tightens rules for Moscow trade /
Examine the new bureaucratic problems of Baltic commerce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ENRIQUE TESSIERI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACK IN the centrally planned days when Moscow had enough muscle and
merchandise, it dictated all terms of trade with its compliant Soviet
republics.
Local companies got their orders from their ministries, which in turn
received strict guidelines from Gosplan, the state planning ministry, on
where, how much and the value of the merchandise they were going to trade.
But now some republics, such as Estonia, are trying to break out from under
the constraining wings of Moscow. Estonia is attempting to exercise its own
control through the use of a licensing bureau monitoring which, and at what
level, exports can leave its economic border.
Other republics and smaller-scale districts are following the same pattern,
such that one Bank of Estonia official described the USSR as being engulfed
internally by a vast and complex amount of trade barriers: 'The USSR is
becoming a country made up of many Albanias.'
Estonia's year-old Licence Department, backed by the muscle of its customs
officials, is an attempt to eliminate the danger of chronic shortages of
commodities, as well as an expression of its desire to mark out greater
political and economic autonomy from Moscow.
Shortages of basic goods in Estonia have arisen, thanks to extreme
differences in relative prices between the different republics of the Soviet
Union. Thus it has become a profitable trade to buy in bulk from one
republic at a relatively cheap price, and sell dear in a neighbouring
republic.
Items in greatest demand from Estonia include meat, sweets and other
foodstuffs. In Latvia it is electronic equipment and vans, while in
Lithuania it is refrigerators and television sets, according to Mr Rein
Voog, an official with the Bank of Estonia.
'A person can become rich very fast if he trades in the USSR. For example,
if you can buy meat in Estonia and take it to Leningrad you can make a lot
of money since meat in Leningrad is twice as expensive. This is why
(Estonia) must keep a certain degree of control over what leaves the
country,' said Mr Voog.
To make sure no-one empties a market at the - by western and black-market
standards - ridiculously low regulated prices, republics like Estonia have
issued their inhabitants with a purchasing card. A Latvian cannot, for
example, buy meat at an Estonian market.
Mr Voog admits that trade with the west is much easier than within the
Soviet Union, since the rules are clear and simple to follow. Estimpex,
which has lost its monopoly as the sole Estonian export organisation, still
functions.
The Bank of Estonia official felt that for some companies it may be easier
to do business with Estimpex, which is known in some business circles in the
west. It may also be easier to get an export licence through Estimpex. Since
Gosplan has been undermined by the unstable economic situation in the USSR
and by inefficient price controls, Soviet republics such as Estonia have
established barter committees, state-run bodies, to carry out trade with
other republics. The export quotas of the Estonian barter committee are
regulated by the Licence Department.
Mr Mati Jurgens, general-director of the Estonian Licence Department, says
it granted 1,700 export licences last year, and will double that in 1991.
Most of the licences are for furniture and building materials. About 60 per
cent went to Russia, the rest to the Ukraine, Latvia and Lithuania.
Each barter deal between the Estonian and other Soviet republic barter
committees is done on a case-by-case basis. There are no standard ratios or
values which the Estonian barter committee uses or agreements on which value
a certain commodity will have. These factors are determined by forces of
'demand' and 'what is in great shortage', according to Mr Jurgens. If a
company's export papers are in order, getting an export licence should take
no longer than 15 days.
'A recent barter deal we approved with Russia involved an Estonian furniture
company, which purchased the steel to build the chairs. These chairs were
sold back to Russia for 70 roubles a piece,' explained Mr Jurgens.
Other examples of trade can involve cash roubles. An Estonian state,
collective or co-operative farm may need to buy a tractor. According to Mr
Jurgens, the seller of the tractor may ask as much as 30,000 roubles for
such a vehicle or two tons of meat in payment.
Arguing over the price of the meat, they may agree on 10 roubles a kilo,
which would add up to 20,000 roubles' worth of meat. The remaining 10,000
roubles could be paid in cash.
Mr Jurgens says there are still staffing problems in effectively controlling
Estonia's economic borders. A great deal of merchandise is getting out
without official permission; the Estonian-Latvian customs checkpoint at the
small town of Moisakula has one local policeman on patrol, who has
permission to use a revolver. One can cross the Estonian-Latvian border on
the smaller roads without being stopped by any customs officials.

<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S most important organised labour group, the Confederation of
Venezuelan Workers (CTV), has attacked a government decree ordering a 15 per
cent wage rise. It warned of 'grave consequences' if the decree was
implemented.
In a public letter to President Carlos Andres Perez at the weekend, the CTV
expressed its 'deep disgust and rejection' of the administration's decree.
Earlier this year the group demanded a 45 per cent nationwide wage increase,
which was rejected by the government as inflationary. But last week the
administration decreed a 15 per cent wage rise for private-sector employees
not covered by collective labour contracts, and ordered a 50 per cent rise
in the urban minimum wage, to Dollars 109 (Pounds 63) a month.
The CTV has strongly opposed most of the government's economic reform
programme since it was announced in early 1989. Ironically, its leadership
is dominated by members of Democratic Action, Mr Perez's own political
party.
The group's head, Mr Antonio Rios, and other officials are currently under
investigation for alleged corruption. In some sectors, labour's militant
demands for wage increases are seen as an attempt to divert attention from
the allegations.
At the same time the government has warned that if 'price speculation'
continued on basic items it would reinstate limited price controls.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Recession-hit US states consider tax increases: Spending
cuts target education and health programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE US states are being forced to consider tax increases, across-the-board
spending cuts and staff redundancies and lay-offs as a result of shortfalls
in tax receipts caused by the recession.
The Centre for the Study of the States, a think-tank based in Albany, New
York, has calculated that tax receipts in the 50 states during the first
three months of this year averaged just 0.9 per cent higher than a year
earlier. Had many states not imposed tax increases, revenue would have
declined 1.3 per cent. In real, inflation-adjusted, terms receipts dropped 6
per cent.
In California revenue dropped 5.7 per cent in the period as a result of
lower personal, corporate and sales taxes. There were also declines in
Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Only
states which have enacted tax increases - such as New Jersey, Oklahoma,
Kentucky and Arizona - saw revenue rise appreciably.
Individual states, rather than the federal government, have to fund a wider
range of social and community services than local authorities do in Britain
and much of Europe.
For instance, the federal government finances only 6 per cent of education
spending, with the rest coming from state or local city and county taxes.
States are particularly vulnerable as they rely heavily on sales taxes,
which have been affected by sluggish consumer spending. Costs of programmes
such as health care for the poor and elderly, prisons and law and order are
rising rapidly, in some instances outstripping inflation. The cost of
Medicaid, half of which is borne by the states, rose 25 per cent last year.
Moreover, most states are legally required to balance their budgets and
cannot run deficits on their current spending. During the 1980s, thanks to
inflation and rapid growth, many states built up cash surpluses, but their
balances are down to Dollars 5.9bn (Pounds 3.4bn), or 2 per cent of total
expenditures, the lowest level since 1983.
Consequently, according to the National Governors Association, 29 states
have cut a total of more than Dollars 8bn from their budgets and 26 states
are raising taxes by a record Dollars 10.3bn for the current 1991 fiscal
year, with Dollars 6.7bn already planned for the next fiscal year.
This presents considerable political problems, in view of voters' resistance
to tax increases; their aversion was largely responsible for the defeat of
several incumbent governors in last November's elections and there are fears
that current problems could spark further taxpayer revolts.
The main spending cuts have been in mental health programmes, higher
education and, in some cases, aid to local schools. State employees have
been laid off or given days off without pay as state governments shut down
on selected days.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government is likely to get a much needed boost this week
from Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures showing inflation has moved onto a
downward path.
Analysts are forecasting a rise of around 0.4 per cent in the March-quarter
CPI, due on Thursday, which would reduce the annual rate of inflation from
6.9 per cent to 5.5 per cent. This would represent a significant improvement
over the 2.7 per cent increase in the December quarter, and would put
Australia on course for annualised inflation of less than 5 per cent by the
end of the year.
It would also allow Mr Paul Keating, the treasurer (finance minister), to
claim a measure of success in controlling inflation, which has been the
government's top priority since the economy slipped into recession last
year.
However, critics say the March figures will be heavily influenced by one-off
factors, including a 15.6 per cent reduction in petrol prices and lower
mortgage interest rates.
The improved longer-term outlook is largely a result of the weakness of the
economy, which grew by only 0.6 per cent in the December quarter, following
six months of negative growth, and is expected to contract again in the
March quarter.
The government is facing political problems caused by a continuing increase
in unemployment, which reached 9.9 per cent in April and is likely to exceed
the 10.3 per cent recorded in the trough of the last recession in 1983. The
high level of unemployment has increased pressure for an early cut in
official interest rates to stimulate growth, but economists say the
government may delay until next month, unless the inflation figures are
unexpectedly good.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Indian Elections: Hindu party's rise unsettles Moslem north
 -There is a tangible sense of fear in the towns of Uttar Pradesh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Around the white-washed village mosques of northern India and in the densely
populated Moslem areas of the main towns, there is a tangible sense of fear
as this election campaign enters its final phase.
Maulana Mannan Raza Khan, a Moslem cleric in Bareilly, a market town in
central Uttar Pradesh where 25 per cent of the population is Moslem, says
Moslems are beginning to ask themselves whether they should stay in the area
or leave for the duration of the election.
What seemed scarcely conceivable a few weeks ago has now become a distinct
possibility. The Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), campaigning
on a platform of establishing a Hindu state, has generated such a wave of
support that it could emerge as the single largest party in next week's
polls.
In Uttar Pradesh, the largest state of the union and the traditional
barometer of electoral swings, Mr Rajiv's Gandhi's Congress party seems
everywhere on the defensive.
By contrast, local BJP officials are triumphantly self- confident. 'There is
a wave sweeping in our favour,' says a party worker at Bara Banki, near
Lucknow, a constituency with no previous record of returning the Hindu
revivalist party.
A BJP-led government is still the less likely outcome to this election. But
the pace of the party's advance has caught Moslems off balance and for the
first time faced them with the prospect of a party coming to power on a
platform that they feel threatens their religious and cultural identity.
Moslems account for 12 per cent of India's population or more than 100m
people.
'If the BJP comes to power and implements the policies in its manifesto',
says Dr Kalbe Sadiq, the leader of the Shia community in Lucknow and a
senior Moslem known for his moderation, 'then we will have to protect our
identity and the basic fundamentals of Islam.'
A central plank of the manifesto is the BJP's pledge to push ahead with the
construction of a Hindu temple at Ayodhya on the site of a former mosque.
The building of the temple has become a symbol of confrontation with Islam.
Another commitment is the introduction of a uniform civil code which would
replace Islamic personal law. Other Moslem clerics are far more belligerent.
'Moslems cannot live in a Hindu rashtra (state),' says Maulana Raza Khan.
'We would have to fight - to issue a fatwa (decree) for a crusade.'
This election is witnessing a greater polarisation between Hindus and
Moslems than any previous campaign. As Hindu votes in the north gravitate
towards the BJP, Moslem votes are swinging to what seems the party best
placed in any one constituency to defeat it. The Congress party had hoped to
benefit from a consolidation of the Moslem vote against the BJP. But in many
constituencies the Janata Dal or the Communists are the main challengers.
The Moslem vote is thus divided - with the BJP reaping the benefit.
Moslems hope that if the BJP did come to power, reason would prevail, and
that a repetition of the Hindu-Moslem violence that has cost more than 2,000
lives in the past year can be avoided.
'We feel no hate for Hindus,' say Moslem villagers at Bhojpuri, near
Bareilly. They point to the Brahmin families in the village who in the past
have protected them at times of communal tension.
Many orthodox, middle-class Hindus, who for the first time are backing the
BJP because of their disillusionment with the other parties, have also
convinced themselves that the BJP in power would not implement the
controversial parts of its programme. Nonetheless this campaign is sowing
seeds of religious hatred that will be difficult to remove.
In the shade of a mango orchard on the edge of Bhojpuri, a local leader of
the Hindu extremist RSS movement - the parent organisation of the BJP -
blames Moslems for the secessionist movements in Kashmir, Assam and Punjab.
'Why is it,' he asks his audience, 'that wherever there are Moslems there is
a demand for a separate state?'
Some Moslems concede that the Moslem community itself must bear much of the
blame for Hindu resentment and anger. Hindus feel that Moslems are dragging
down the country's economic growth by higher rates of illiteracy and
population growth.
Dr Kalbe says that Islamic doctrine permits certain types of family
planning. But most Moslem clerics in India are adamantly opposed to it.
Even if the BJP emerges with the most seats, Moslems hope that other parties
will ally to prevent it coming to power. But they feel a reprieve may be
only temporary.

ISRAEL is expected today to ask Brussels to extend the anti-Arab-boycott
legislation that already exists in two EC states to Community level.
The expected request by Mr David Levy, the Israeli foreign minister, to a
formal EC-Israel meeting here coincides with growing interest in the
Community, as well as the US, in at least an easing of the Arab boycott of
companies trading with Israel as a confidence-building measure to boost
Middle East peace efforts.
On Saturday, several EC foreign ministers urged the six Gulf Co-operation
Council members to use their influence within the Arab League for an easing
of the boycott. The latter said this was only conceivable in the context of
an Arab-Israeli peace deal.
France and the Netherlands have national laws forbidding their companies to
give the Arab Boycott Office formal undertakings they will not trade with
Israel.
The Israeli government wants such legislation adopted by the EC as a whole,
arguing, among other points, that general Arab incitement creates commercial
distortion.
Germany and Denmark now sympathise with the Israeli view, but most other EC
states want to wait and see how Israel responds to peace overtures and
prefer to exert quiet political pressure on the Arabs.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Saudis to take up Dollars 4.5bn loan: First fund-raising
from banks for at least 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Euromarkets Correspondent

<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA is close to calling upon a Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.66bn) loan
from international banks, having negotiated an increase in the loan's size
and a reduction in the interest margin charged, bankers said yesterday.
They said a loan agreement had been signed by the Saudi government and 20
international banks this month in Paris. The loan, arranged by JP Morgan of
New York, should be drawn down shortly.
The financing, the first fund-raising by the government from international
banks for at least 20 years, was first negotiated in February, before the
ground assault on Kuwait had been launched by the US-led coalition. Then,
the three-year loan was for Dollars 3.5bn and the interest margin over
London interbank offered rates, the floating benchmark used in the
international loans market, set at  1/2 percentage point.
Bankers said at the time that the loan carried a war risk premium. The
Saudis used the swift ending of the war to negotiate a reduction in the
interest margin to  3/8 point over Libor. Morgan also brought in new banks
to increase the size of the transaction.
Difficulties over the loan documentation apparently delayed the signing. The
purpose of the loan is general, although it is possible that at least some
of it will be used to pay the Saudi contribution to the coalition war
effort. It pledged Dollars 13.5bn to the US.
The Saudi government has tried to to keep the fund-raising quiet, as it is
seen as a source of embarrassment inside the country because of the Islamic
proscription against usury. However, there are expectations that it will
have to raise more soon. Although benefiting from higher oil prices and
increased oil production resulting from the Gulf crisis, the Saudis insist
they have lost out because of the cost of the war.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Bank of Japan urges review on foreign workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan has called for an immediate review of Japan's virtual ban
on the employment of foreign workers, in a rare public comment on a
highly-sensitive political problem.
In a report on the country's labour shortage published this month, the
central bank says that 'the employment of foreign workers is an urgent issue
which requires examination from every angle'.
The fear that labour shortages increase the risk of inflation has played a
central part in the bank's decision to push up interest rates over the past
two years. It will remain a key factor in future management of the economy,
says the report.
'It is a grave concern that a growing scarcity in labour supply,
particularly in the younger age brackets, might cause serious labour
shortages in future.'
The recent shortages have been caused not only by a cyclical surge in
economic growth but also by long-term changes in the economy, including a
shift to greater demand for labour-intensive services. At the same time,
with the ageing of society, the growth of the workforce has slowed, says the
report. The central bank says that in 1996 the working population will start
to decline.
The decline is being alleviated by increases in the employment of women,
investment in labour-saving equipment, growth in the import of
labour-intensive manufactured goods and the transfer of factories overseas.
'In order to achieve non-inflationary economic growth under limited supply
of labour, these changes in the economy must continue steadily.'
Japan also has to carry out measures which will allow for the employment of
more women and more older people, says the central bank. It also has to
press on with deregulation and rationalisation in the distribution system to
release more labour. Companies need to adjust management plans. Meanwhile,
as for macro-economic policy, priorities should be 'maintaining price
stability and avoiding a vicious spiral of wages and price increases'.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Carey's 'assault on poverty'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR GEORGE CAREY, who was enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury and head of
the international Anglican communion last month, yesterday made a 'fresh
assault on poverty' a priority of his time in office, Alan Pike, Social
Affairs Correspondent, writes.
'When I travel abroad, beginning with my trip to Papua New Guinea this
summer, I shall make it my business to visit poor communities and learn how
best we can be alongside them in their struggles,' he said.
All Britons, said Dr Carey, should use the opportunities of democracy to
'encourage the government of the day as it plays its part in the fight
against world poverty'.
While welcoming recent pledges by the UK government - including a commitment
to increase the aid budget to the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of
gross domestic product as soon as possible - he made it clear that he
believes international aid must receive a higher priority.
He said UK government efforts to ease third world debt burdens should be
encouraged. 'We in the richer countries received in debt repayments last
year the equivalent of Pounds 17 for each man, woman and child in countries
most affected by poverty.'

FT  14 MAY 91 / Baker puts on brave face as Mideast mission wavers
</HEADLINE>

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, takes his Middle East peace
mission to Jordan and Israel today with little sign of any tangible progress
in his efforts to convene a regional peace conference.
After talks yesterday in Cairo with his Soviet counterpart, Mr Alexander
Bessmertnykh, Mr Baker told reporters that there were 'significant
differences' between Israel and Syria on a UN role at a proposed conference,
and on the exact nature of the gathering.
Damascus is pressing for a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East
dispute on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which
require Israel to withdraw from land occupied in the 1967 war, including
Syria's Golan Heights. But Israeli leaders discount UN participation, saying
the world body is biased.
Israel is also against a regional conference that has any status beyond that
of a ceremonial 'opening' to direct talks with its neighbours. Syria wants a
regional gathering to have a role in overseeing peace moves.
With the Baker mission hung up on these procedural issues, other knotty
questions are tending to be overlooked at this stage, such as the perennial
problem of who might represent the Palestinians. Mr Baker is pressing for a
joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to overcome Israel's objection to
sitting down with representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
which it describes as a 'terrorist gang'.
Officials close to Mr Baker have warned that if by the end of the week there
is little sign of progress, the US secretary of state will abandon his
latest round of peace-making and return to Washington.
Mr Baker is seeking to put the best public face on a very unpromising
situation, but in private US officials have sounded pessimistic. A rash of
statements from Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's premier, in the past few days
insisting that there would be no territorial compromise have cast a
deepening shadow over the Baker mission.
Mr Bessmertnykh tried to sound a faint note of optimism after his meeting
with Mr Baker, telling reporters that 'our talks on the Middle East have
reached a large plateau.' Problems were fewer than before which gave 'ground
for hope', he added.
Mr Bessmertnykh was due to meet Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, in Geneva
today. 'They are meeting here on Tuesday but that's all I can say at this
stage,' said a PLO official in Geneva.

IRAN pressed ahead with its commitment to the private sector by announcing
yesterday the sell-off of IR100bn worth of shares in state-owned companies
this year. The sale is equivalent to about Pounds 44m at the floating
exchange rate.
Mr Mohammed Reza Nematzadeh, industry minister, made the announcement in
Tehran. Around 70 per cent of industry is in government hands. President
Hashemi Rafsanjani's government is committed to the sale of state-owned
assets, many nationalised after the 1979 revolution. Strategic heavy
industries will remain in the public sector.
Transfer of most mines to private sector and co-operatives has been

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED bickering between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat
party and its sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), could
delay the signing of an important friendship treaty between Germany and
Poland.
The conservative CSU's routine complaint about lack of influence in the Bonn
coalition has reached a new pitch since the Christian Democrat defeat in the
Rhineland-Palatinate state election. Despite Mr Kohl's initially disdainful
response to CSU attacks, he has now decided to concede to the Bavarians a
round of consultation on the Poland treaty, to take place today.
The treaty, which was to be initialled today and is due to be signed
formally on June 17, spells out the minority rights for ethnic Germans in
Poland. Polish President Lech Walesa is expected to visit Germany after it
is ratified.
Although it has been welcomed by most German politicians, including many in
the CSU, the treaty was negotiated almost single-handed by the Free Democrat
foreign minister, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whom conservatives accuse of
monopolising German foreign policy.
This is particularly irritating for the CSU, which considers itself, along
with conservative Christian Democrats, the champion of ethnic Germans
throughout eastern Europe. At today's meeting the CSU is likely to call for
closer monitoring of the treaty rights for ethnic Germans and clarification
over the issue of dual citizenship.
The centre-right coalition also faces a further dispute over the need to
merge east Germany's liberal abortion laws with the more restrictive laws in
west Germany. The Free Democrats support an extension to west Germany of the
old east German law allowing abortion on demand in the first three months of
pregnancy to be qualified only by compulsory counselling. This has been
attacked by the CSU and many Christian Democrats as too liberal.
Mr Heinrich Franke, president of Germany's Federal Labour Office, said
yesterday that between 10,000 and 20,000 east Germans were still moving to
west Germany every month.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Hungary takes the lead on foreign investment / A look at who
is really getting down to business after the post-communist euphoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment in eastern Europe is beginning cautiously to take off
after a false start during the brief post-communist euphoria. It has gone
farthest in Hungary, traditional testbed for the region's economic
experiments, where liberal foreign investment laws appeared first more than
two years ago.
Central Budapest has lost some of the bustle of a year ago, when the flurry
of visiting western businessmen gave the impression of a town in the middle
of a gold rush. The Forum Hotel is no longer booked for months ahead and
consultants complain less of 'corporate tourists' besieging them.
But, shorn of the early grandiose hopes and the disappointment which dashed
them, investment in Hungary has quietly become substantial.
Half of all foreign investment in east Europe (excluding Germany) went to
Hungary in 1990, says Mr Bela Kadar, minister of international economic
relations. True, that reflects how little has flowed to the rest of the
region as much as it does Hungary's own success.
Foreign direct investment in the country last year amounted to something
between Dollars 750m and Dollars 1bn - either figure is but a fraction of
that enjoyed by the south European or south-east Asian countries which
compete with east Europe for investment.
Accumulated investment is also only 3.5 - 4 per cent of the Hungarian
company sector, so there is a long way to go to reach the government's 25
per cent medium-term target.
Nevertheless, it is early yet and the trend is sharply upwards. Companies'
financial reports showed Ft93.2bn (Dollars 1.53bn) of accumulated foreign
investment at the end of 1990, compared with Ft29.3bn a year earlier.
Officials expect another Dollars 1bn this year. In newspapers and
sugar-refining, foreign ownership has penetrated deep. Foreign media
companies now have dominant stakes in all Hungary's main national daily
newspapers.
Even more dramatically, the number of joint ventures registered jumped from
900 at the end of 1989 to about 7,500 at the end of March, according to
Central Statistical Office estimates. In addition, there are another 1,200
companies with foreign stakes.
Officials and economists caution that many Hungarian businesses have set up
joint ventures simply to avoid tax or customs. A better - albeit indirect -
indication of a surge in interest is the breakneck pace of expansion of
western accountancy and law firms in the past 18 months.
Even so, consultants are finding it difficult to keep up with a quickening
rhythm of large acquisitions and new investments. The conclusions of deals
worth more than Dollars 40m are running at more than one a month so far this
year. Moreover, many more transactions are in the offing as Hungary's
flagship First Privatisation Programme begins to take off.
Investors are attracted particularly to Hungary because of the official
welcome it gives to foreign capital. Western lawyers praise the foreign
investment and company acts for their western quality. Officials boast that
the country has the most liberal investment regime in the world, citing the
right to set up in the service sector, acquire majority control without
special permission and fully repatriate profits. The company law mimics the
German. Better, the laws have improved with use in the two years they have
been in effect.
So much for the principle. The practice has been frustrating, which makes
the growth in foreign investment all the more impressive.
The first problem, especially for deals involving real estate, is to find
someone with the authority to sell a property. Central and local authorities
and current occupiers and former owners make rival claims. A recent act
compensating the last group should help but it leaves questions unanswered.
Nor is approval from the State Property Agency, the central privatisation
authority, easily obtained. It sometimes treats well-known international
companies 'shabbily', says one senior consultant. The agency promises a
decision on whether to give the go-ahead to a serious proposal and then
delays it, again and again, without explanation.
Negotiations themselves are an endurance test. Foreign buyers, state company
managers, SPA officials, the enterprise council representing the workforce,
and various accountants, valuators and legal counsels - all participate.
Turnout at these unwieldy meetings in smoke-filled rooms can easily reach 25
and the whole group goes through agreements word by word, says Mr Theodore
Boone, a lawyer at Baker &amp; McKenzie.
'Hungarian managers are willing to bring up issues again which everybody
thought the book had been closed on.'
Price can be a particular stumbling block because valuations vary wildly. 'A
company's past record is meaningless and everything around it is in flux,'
says Mr Istvan Denes, managing director of the First Hungary Fund, an
investment fund. That can lead to big gaps between negotiating positions.
Even once the negotiations are over, the formalities of setting up a new
joint venture can hold things up. One of the tightest bottle-necks is the
company registration court whose 15 overworked judges can take three months
to handle an application.
Patience has been one of a potential investor's most valuable qualities. One
investment fund which has made it a particular virtue is John Govett's
Hungarian Investment Company.
'HIC avoided the mistakes others did by diligence and investing a lot of
time,' says Mr Adam Batthany, a prime ministerial adviser who doubles as a
board member.
Patience is also needed more generally. It takes time to implement essential
laws and rules; even longer for them to be worn in and for business culture
to change.
Hungary is at least showing that the delay, while frustrating, is not fatal
for investment in east Europe. Investment is taking off, and, says Mr Denes:
'It's getting easier by the day to get things done.'

BORBA, Yugoslavia's pro-government daily newspaper yesterday threw its
weight behind General Vejko Kadijevic, the defence minister who last week
said that a civil war had started in the country, writes Laura Silber.
Described by Borba as 'a soldier for a time of crisis', he is a member of Mr
Ante Markovic's federal government. But until recently he supported the
Communist Party - Movement for Yugoslavia, a revived party formed by retired
army officers and hardline Communists.
However, he has exercised a moderating influence on the army's leadership
following the outbreak of ethnic violence between Serbs and Croats two weeks
ago.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Monday Interview: M'learned friend's tough brief - Michael
Howard, UK employment secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In his short ministerial life, Mr Michael Howard has played many parts, all
to mixed reviews. He piloted the Financial Services Bill through the Commons
with great technical skill, but some think without much real feel for the
task in hand. He was responsible for the poll tax legislation, about which
no more need be said; and he ran water privatisation, eventually to acclaim,
although at one point it looked as if his own career might not prosper as a
result. Now, only eight years after becoming an MP, he is employment
secretary as unemployment has crashed through the 2m barrier for the second
time since the Tories took office in 1979.
It is difficult to ruffle Mr Howard. He spent the years between 1970, when
he failed for a second time to capture Liverpool Edge Hill, and 1983 when he
won the safe-ish seat of Folkestone and Hythe, building up his reputation at
the Bar. Once he has taken a brief, he does not easily yield; colleagues
report that following Mrs Thatcher's demise, he remained one of the
cabinet's staunchest poll tax diehards.
But people say Mr Howard is a briefcase carrier rather than a gut
politician; that he is clever but lacks conviction or passion and that he
has never had an original political thought in his life.
At the first charge, one detects a modest stirring of Welsh blood - the son
of a dress-shop owner, he went to Llanelli Grammar School. 'I care deeply
and passionately about people, about issues and about the future of this
country,' he says.
But to the second charge, he pleads guilty. 'I'm not sure you would find all
that many practising politicians who can lay claim to original ideas. I
think the art of politics is selecting the best of the ideas which
originally were thought of by those not active in politics and making an
assessment whether they will work and achieve the result you wish to
achieve.' Before the interview, his office said he had written no political
pamphlets; a fact which turns out not to be quite correct. He has in fact
co-authored two: one about the economy with his old friend Norman Lamont -
Howard was best man at the chancellor's wedding  - and the other,
improbably, with Mr Julian Critchley advancing the case of the East African
Asians. He is due to publish one solo this week but it is just a rehash of
Central Office nostrums.
It is not hard to identify the badge on Mr Howard's philosophical cap. He
pays homage to Iain Macleod; but above all, remains loyal to the founders of
Thatcherism. 'I think we have established the tramlines along which we
intend to travel; they were established during the last 12 years,' he says.
One aim of this interview is to find out whether the Thatcherite Mr Howard,
surrounded by his paintings of the Battle of Blenheim, envisages any change
in employment policy in the light of the change at Number 10.
His straight answer to this question is an uncompromising 'No. My agenda was
clearly set when I arrived here.'
At the top was and is training. He has had the task of implementing the
blueprint to create 82 employer-led and dominated Training and Enterprise
Councils across the land. 'I can speak for a very long time about this,' he
says menacingly, having already spoken for several minutes about this 'very
exciting initiative'.
It is indeed an important, if last-gasp attempt to smarten up Britain's
bedraggled training system, by handing the task to committees led on a
part-time basis by top local businessmen. He admits no doubt about the
sustainability of the approach, although he says he is frequently tested in
his determination to stick to the principle that the businessmen involved
must be of chief operating officer grade, rather than, say, personnel
directors. 'I remain of the view that it's right to stick to these demanding
criteria,' he says.
He is also not impressed with the other grumbles Tec chairman vent in
private. He thinks the Tecs are on target to deliver their guaranteed levels
of performance and that they should work through the current financial year
before he considers any further change to their freedom to shift funds from
one area of work to another. The Tecs, says Mr Howard, already have more
financial and operating flexibility than any comparable body, something
which has made them richly inventive.
On the future of trades union law, he is elusive. Having suggested early in
his term of office that the Thatcher decade had completed the job, he now
appears to be wavering. 'We keep it under review and we must always look to
see whether there's a need for further change in the law. Some recent
developments, such as the episode of the NUM (the Scargill financial
controversy), have clearly indicated that the law needs attention, but we
haven't reached any decisions yet on what the manifesto should say.' Among
the issues he has in mind are the powers of union certification officers,
the penalties for improper accounting and access by members to their unions'
financial affairs.
The government's biggest problem in the employment area, however, continues
to be excessive wage pressure during a period of disinflation. He is
scornful of suggestions that some move towards a national economic
assessment or co-ordinated pay bargaining might have a role, sticking to the
Thatcherite dictum: 'Locally devolved pay bargaining is likely to be the
most effective.' The creation of a pay review body for the teachers was, he
insists, a special case. 'I don't see that as a precursor for a profusion of
review bodies in other areas.'
Assuming that Mr Howard continues to speak for his party on these matters,
that suggests a potentially widening gap with a Labour party committed to a
minimum wage, upon which subject Mr Howard adopts his most practised silk's
scorn for a piece of bogus court-room evidence. He appears to harbour no
fear that the public mood is moving against him in this area. Nor, however,
does he have a convincing explanation as to why this attitude should not be
applied to wages councils, which set minimum wages for 2.5m workers in
certain sectors. 'We see no permanent place for wages councils in our
system,' he says, but declines to say when the fox will be shot.
He has been asked so often what it feels like to preside over another
outbreak of mass unemployment that the answers are cut and tucked into sound
bites; Britain still has below average unemployment in Europe etc. The
government's job, he says, is to persist with the right, firm financial
framework and to take the consequences. That is what he means, he says, when
he talks about the relentless, practical struggle over many years to apply
the chosen political philosophy.
It is only when we turn to Europe that there is a sign of the Majoresque
emollience. Mr Howard, like his former boss, enjoyed playing rough on
Europe, once accusing Ms Vasso Papandreou, the social affairs commissioner,
of bringing the Community into disrepute. On the day that Mrs Thatcher
resigned, officials in Mrs Papandreou's directorate were jubilant at the
thought that it might mean the end of Mr Howard.
Today, however, his tone is softer. He always used to say that one third of
the social charter was totally unacceptable, a third possibly negotiable and
a third, mainly that pertaining to health and safety, fine.
Now, he says, 'it looks as though a dozen out of 50 proposals are likely to
be unacceptable', although it remains unclear which of these will be
determined by qualified majority and therefore leave Britain out-voted. 'We
have done quite well so far, but there's no guarantee that we shall be able
to construct the necessary minority on all the proposals.'
The more mellow atmosphere, he says, stems partly from a deal he struck with
Ms Papandreou earlier this year, when she agreed that draft directives would
be shown to member governments before publication and when she agreed to
accept additional help to improve the so-called 'impact statements'
evaluating the costs and consequences of proposed measures.
He must, one imagines, be a formidable opponent in EC ministerial councils.
He does his homework, enjoys detail and displays no self-doubt about
fundamentals. He has missed only one such council, which took place at the
height of the leadership election, when he was doing his lonely best to
ensure that Mrs Thatcher fought on.
Now she has gone, he will not say whether he thinks the party's chances of
election victory have increased or diminished. Personal intimations of
mortality were delivered in the recent local council elections, when
Folkestone was lost to the Liberal Democrats.
Indeed, he makes little of the much discussed change of style at Number 10,
preferring instead to laud another of the new prime minister's qualities.
'It's determination that matters,' he says, 'battling.'

UP TO 1,830 vehicles in General Motors new Saturn line, intended to
demonstrate the US car company's competitiveness against its Japanese
rivals, are to be recalled.
GM's Saturn division, initiated in 1983, says 7 per cent of the vehicles it
has built since it began production last autumn, must be replaced because
they were filled with a faulty coolant which could damage the engine. The
coolant was supplied by a Texaco subsidiary.
This is the second recall of Saturn cars. The first, in February, involved
1,210 vehicles with a faulty seat mechanism, which the company also blamed
on a supplier.
The latest recall is believed to represent the first offer by a large motor
manufacturer to replace an entire vehicle for a problem of this type. It
demonstrates the importance GM attaches to creating an image of reliability
for Saturn.
Saturn, a small car made largely from plastics, is an attempt by GM to
compete with the quality and production standards of the small, imported
Japanese cars which have a big share of the US domestic market.
The project has involved ground-breaking agreements with unions, suppliers
and dealers. GM's investment amounts to about Dollars 4bn.

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Dresdner moves into private
banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRESDNER Bank is following the lead of its larger rival Deutsche Bank and
setting up a private banking house aimed at creating a more exclusive
service for increasingly wealthy and sophisticated German private investors.
Hardy &amp; Co Privatbankiers, opening at the beginning of July, will have the
characteristics of a private bank, while tapping the resources and
technology of the Dresdner Bank group.
While no minimum wealth criteria have been revealed, Dresdner suggested it
was targeting investors with a net worth of roughly DM5m (Dollars 2.9m) or
more.
Hardy &amp; Co, a private bank set up in Berlin in 1880, was merged into the
Deutsche Landerbank, a subsidiary of Dresdner 10 years ago. The latter sold
the Landerbank to Swiss Banking Corporation in 1985, but retained the name
of Hardy &amp; Co, which it is now using to set up the new bank.
Dresdner will own 100 per cent of the capital, but Hardy &amp; Co's private
banking identity will be underlined by two personally liable partners
running the business. Based in Frankfurt, it will start operations with a
staff of around 40.
Mr Utz Pfannschmidt, one of the two partners, stressed the bank would work
within, not in competition with, the rest of the Dresdner group, catering
for high net worth investors whose increasingly sophisticated requirements
could not be met as effectively in the existing structure.
The so-called inheritance generation in Germany is presenting the big banks
with a considerable challenge as to how to retain such clients. Deutsche
Bank has, for instance, bought a stake of more than 80 per cent in the old
private bank Grunelius.
Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, managing board member in charge of securities and
investment, estimated the operation would break even over a period of
between three and five years, in what he described as a 'growth market par
excellence'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAVALIN, the big Canadian engineering and manufacturing group, plans to
return to basics after a decade of heady expansion.
Most of its industrial holdings are being put up for sale.
The group, with annual revenues of more than USDollars 1bn, wants to
concentrate on its engineering and project management business, developed
internationally in the 1960s and 1970s.
Lavalin has built its reputation in energy, transportation, aluminium
smelting, pulp and paper and many other industrial sectors.
Mr Bernard Lamarre, chairman, is offering half Lavalin's 85 per cent
interest in UTDC, an Ontario rail equipment maker, and all of Kemtec, a
specialised petrochemical producer in Montreal.
Together, they have annual sales of about USDollars 500m, are losing money
and require injections of new capital.
Lavalin bought UTDC in 1986 from the Ontario government, which retains a 15
per cent interest. UTDC pioneered the Vancouver Skytrain people-mover, which
Lavalin has tried to sell worldwide.
Kemtec has taken a severe blow from declining petrochemical prices.

<TEXT>
PROBLEMS with tenants and subsidiaries are having a domino effect on some
credit ratings of the Reich-mann brothers' business empire.
Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its rating on the Reichmanns' 59 Maiden Lane in
New York, citing a tenant of the big office development and the parlous
state of the New York property market as problems.
A USDollars 200m issue of Euro-notes due 1995 secured on 59 Maiden Lane was
downgraded to A- from AA. However the agency said this did not affect
Olympia and York Developments, the Reichmanns' core holding company.
Moody's downgraded nearly USDollars 1bn of Gulf Canada Resources debt
because of the company's poor profit prospects and declining interest
coverage.
The Gulf Canada senior debentures were lowered to Baa-3 from Baa-1. About
USDollars 150m of short-term debt issued by a Reichmann property subsidiary
in Calgary, Alta, was also downgraded because a leading leaseholder is Gulf
Canada.
The Reichmanns have several big resource holdings, including Gulf Canada,
which operates in oil and gas developments in North America and south-east
Asia.

AEROSPATIALE of France and Italy's Alenia, which have agreed to buy de
Havilland of Canada, are asking the Canadian and Ontario governments to chip
in as much as CDollars 500m (USDollars 434.7m) towards the cost of
modernising the struggling aircraft maker's facilities, writes Bernard
Simon.
Executives of the two European companies, shareholders in the ATR
commuter-aircraft consortium, said the governments' contribution would be
about half the amount needed to maintain de Havilland's design and
production capacity at its plant in Toronto.
Mr Fausto Cereti, Alenia's chief executive, said ATR wanted to create the
world's leading manufacturer of commuter aircraft.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Making faces in the mirror
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market seems to be feeling like I do some mornings. The telephone rings;
perhaps if I go back to sleep it will go away. Despite thin trading, stock
prices go on behaving as if the institutions were flooded with cash. Reality
breaks through for a day, always with some utterly predictable bad news, and
then fades. The ostrich mood was perfectly expressed by a broker interviewed
by one of the wire services in London on Friday evening. Asked to comment on
the week's profit warnings, he was ready: 'I don't believe it's as bad as
they say.'
In a sense, it never is as bad as they say; once a board steels itself to
issuing a warning, it always tries to make sure that it will not have to
issue a second. There is no reason at all, though, to assume that boards are
shading their warnings more than they usually do. Costs are still rising,
sales are very weak, and interest rates are being held deliberately high;
the average company is bound to suffer.
The UK economy is not going through a normal cyclical downturn, but a savage
morning after. Every country which has joined the European monetary club as
a cure for structural inflation has suffered some years of acute discomfort.
Britain, by doing so after a period of financial excess, has ensured that
the adjustment will be more painful than many. The corporate escape from the
credit squeeze, at least, has been well mapped: the steady stream of rights
issues, each greeted with unaccountable shock.
Efficient market theorists will argue that all these uncomfortable facts are
discounted in present price levels, and some cite the high dividend yields
of UK equities in support of this idea. But the international yield gap is
normal, and the reactions to news which ought to have been expected suggests
that the news is not discounted. On the contrary, it suggests that the
market is indulging in the wishful thinking always found at bull market
climaxes - reading its picture of reality from its own price level. This is
as rational as raising morale by grinning at yourself in your shaving
mirror.
This used to be quite a habit on Wall Street. The official US leading
economic indicator formerly gave more weight to stock prices than it does
now. The result was that when the market had a good run, the leading
indicator rose, and this was taken as confirmation that high stock prices
were justified. The Street grew wiser after 1987, and so did the
statisticians. Stock prices have been de-emphasised, and the market takes
less notice of the leading indicator.
In other respects, the buoyancy of Wall Street is easier to justify than
that of London. The consensus forecast is for a recovery, and the Fed is
doing all it can to encourage one. Unfortunately, it remains a matter of jam
tomorrow; the current news continues to be, mainly, worse then expected.
Consumer spending, which is supposed to energise the recovery, remains
depressed, despite the reported rise in confidence - not perhaps as
surprising as it may look, since real disposable incomes in the US have
taken their sharpest fall in 15 years.
Investment is dropping, construction is still on its slow way down, and
exports are not dynamic. Only the weakness of imports makes the fall in
output relatively shallow.
Yet while expectations about the US economy are probably drifting into touch
with reality, equity prices still make inadequate allowance for debt
problems. Something like last Friday's crisis at First National, the
Californian life insurance company, should have been discounted.
It has been obvious all along that in a depressed economy some companies
which issue junk bonds would be in trouble, and so would some companies that
held the bonds. Junk bond yields show that the bond market has been
rational; but the 50-point fall in equities after the First National
announcement suggests that reality stops there.
The bond market, however, is being unrealistic in another way. Market
comments, with some notable exceptions, are full of dire warnings about
inflation - warnings which may in fact prevent the Fed from easing any
further for some time. In fact, though, the only sign of inflation is in the
level of bond yields; and this owes more to German (and Japanese) inflation
expectations than to those in the US. As long as the US Treasury has to
compete with the Germans for long bond funds, it must compete on yields.
In the real US world, producer prices have fallen for four of the last five
months, and the prices of inputs are still very soft; price expectations in
industry are as weak as for the best part of two decades, wage rates follow
their usual sluggish American course, and productivity has been rising as
companies adjust to a soft market.
It would take a much more vigorous recovery in demand than even the wildest
optimists are now predicting to stretch capacity to the point where margins
can be pushed up aggressively. Current estimates are that US output could
rise at a 3-4 per cent rate for two years or more before any constraints
began to appear, but that is still in the unknown future. In such a time
frame US long bonds would surely look highly attractive; but the
disappointing response to last week's auctions confirm that this is not yet
the market view.
The danger is that if the market does come to believe in the low-inflation
scenario, while bond yields are still held up by German problems, the yield
gap between bonds and equities can only be closed on the equity side. In
this sense, the US equity market is potentially more vulnerable to good news
than to bad, while the London market may well be more vulnerable to Wall
Street than to reality.
Finally, a footnote about insider trading. Mr Alistair Alcock, a former
director of corporate finance at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, now at the University
of Buckingham, has sent me a couple of spirited articles he has written on
the subject in the New Law Journal, which may not be on your normal reading
list. He suggests that the insider trading law should be renamed the
Protection of Market-Makers Act, which gives you the tone. Try reading law
for a change.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Brooke in crucial Belfast meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, will today try to rescue from
near collapse his plans for round-table talks on the province's future at
what could prove a 'make or break' meeting in Belfast.
Unionist and nationalist leaders are expected to be presented with
alternative suggestions for the venue of negotiations involving the Irish
government. If agreement cannot be reached, Mr Brooke will have to decide
whether it is worth continuing the talks.
Mr Brooke is believed to have discussed possible fall-back positions with Mr
Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, at a four-hour meeting in London on
Friday.
He has taken gambles before in his talks initiative; successfully bringing
Northern Ireland's constitutional parties together with a 'take it or leave
it' offer before Easter.
This time, the Northern Ireland Office appears to be hoping that, after a
weekend of reflection by the parties involved and the threat of an
embarrassingly early collapse of the talks, there will be sufficient
movement today for a compromise to be reached.
But Mr Brooke knows there will seem little point in continuing to debate a
logistical detail indefinitely. Failure to reach a compromise on this issue
suggests the goodwill believed to exist before talks started had been
exaggerated vastly. Already two weeks have passed, out of the 11 set aside
for round-table talks.
Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, leaders of the Unionist parties,
again insisted at the weekend that they would not hold talks with Dublin
ministers anywhere in Ireland while the Republic's territorial claim to
Northern Ireland remained.
The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party believes that meetings
should rotate between London, Dublin and Belfast.

bond market - a part of Britain's financial sector vital to the government's
ability to borrow funds from the investment community for public spending.
The vote of confidence in the gilt-edged securities market - which only last
year emerged from a period of sustained losses - comes in a report from the
Bank on the financial arrangements underpinning the operations of
marketmakers in the securities.
Gilt marketmakers encompass 18 financial groups which buy and sell bonds in
a secondary market for the securities, mainly on behalf of customers such as
pension funds.
The marketmakers - through their role in buying gilts from the government
and selling them to the international investment community - are likely to
be important in the large programme of gilt issues expected this financial
year. Up to Pounds 15bn of new gilts may be issued during the year, as the
government is in deficit after four years of surplus.
Details of the financial system helping the gilt market to work smoothly are
contained in a report published by the Bank, before its quarterly bulletin
on Thursday. It says the amount of outstanding lending on short-term
positions by marketmakers - an indication of the amount of liquidity in the
gilt market - rose nearly threefold between 1986 and last year, from Pounds
2bn to Pounds 5bn-Pounds 6bn.
The arrangements for channelling funds to and from the gilt market on a
short-term basis were altered at the time of financial deregulation in the
City in 1986, otherwise known as Big Bang. This introduced a greater element
of competition into the market and attracted a number of new overseas
entrants, causing a squeeze on margins and a run of losses which ended only
last year when the gilt business as a whole made a small profit.
The Bank says the new information about liquidity illustrates confidence by
the marketmakers in their ability to borrow. It shows too that the
specialist groups lending to the gilt market may be well placed to increase
their financing operations in other fields such as equities, underpinning
London's role as an international financial centre.
The report mainly covers the activities of the nine specialist
stock-exchange money brokers, which lend money and stock to gilt
marketmakers. The specialist groups are James Capel, Cazenove, Lazard
Brothers, Prudential-Bache, LM (Moneybrokers), Sheppards, King &amp; Shaxson,
Lehman Brothers and Rowe &amp; Pitman.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Tory peers concerned over ECGD sale: Protests on level of
export insurance support may force government concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR TORY peers, including a former trade minister, are seriously
concerned about the level of government support for insuring exports, as
ministers press ahead with the privatisation of part of the Export Credits
Guarantee Department.
Protests over aid for insurance on exports to politically sensitive
countries in particular could force the government to make concessions in
the House of Lords through fear of provoking a large-scale revolt.
The bill paving the way for privatising the short-term credit insurance
operations of the ECGD is expected to reach the Lords next month.
Conservative peers publicly voicing anxiety include Lord Trefgarne, a former
trade minister, and Lord Weir, a former president of the Federation of
British Electrotechnical and Allied Manufacturers' Associations.
Lord Prior, chairman of GEC, is believed to share their anxiety. Others
include Lord Tombs, chairman of Rolls-Royce, who sits as an independent
crossbencher.
At the DTI, Lord Trefgarne was responsible for much of the early preparation
for the sale - including negotiations with the Treasury.
The disquiet reflects the widespread concern among British industrialists
about the level of state aid for exporters compared with overseas rivals,
and adds to the difficulties the government faces on the ECGD sale.
Only three companies have responded to the government's invitation to tender
for ECGD's short-term insurance business. One tender, from Trade Indemnity,
was an offer to collaborate with no money on the table.
In the Commons, Tory rebels succeeded at the bill's committee stage in
inserting a new clause committing the government to continue insuring UK
sales to politically risky developing countries for three years after
privatisation. The clause was overturned by the government, but is expected
to be reintroduced in the Lords.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, sought to appease MPs and exporters with
an assurance that the need for a 'national interest facility' for political
risk reinsurance would be kept under review.
The government's intention was that the facility would continue as long as
it was considered 'essential to meet the reasonable needs of exporters', Mr
Sainsbury said.
However, Lord Trefgarne said: 'The assurances Mr Sainsbury gave, while
helpful, really didn't go far enough.' He also complained about recent
rises, in the face of substantial debts incurred, in the ECGD's premiums for
exports to more difficult markets.
'Ministers should follow the policy that I think previous ministers have
followed which is that British exporters should not be placed at any
disadvantage with their competitors . . . The truth of the matter is that
most of our competitors have lost even more and are prepared to go on doing
so,' said Lord Trefgarne.
Lord Weir said the government had to give 'strong, clear' assurances about
its support for export insurance in the event of the privatisation failing
to have the effect ministers predicted. 'Behind this, one really sees the
hands of the Treasury,' he said.
Lord Tombs said the DTI's stand on political risk insurance was 'indicative'
of its lack of commitment to supporting exporters. Manufacturers only wanted
the level of government support brought up to the same level as foreign
competitors.
'I think privatisation of the insurances is unlikely to improve the position
in the short term because of the government's refusal to take on what can
only be a government responsibility,' he said.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Criticism mounts over NHS reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the government over its health service reforms increased
yesterday when the Institute of Economic Affairs, a leading free market
think tank, joined mounting criticism of the way the changes are working.
The institute contributed ideas to the government review which led to the
introduction of the reforms and it does not question the need for
reorganising the National Health Service.
However, Dr David Green, director of the institute's health and welfare
unit, said yesterday that last month's changes in the hospital service and
forthcoming reforms of long-term care 'suffer from the same structural
flaw'. By rationing health care within cash limits 'arbitrarily set by
government' both reforms reduced consumer choice.
He said that the viability of London teaching hospitals such as Guy's -
which started the political uproar over the reforms by announcing about 600
job cuts last month - depended on attracting patients from outside the
capital.
While many patients would prefer to be treated in London teaching hospitals,
the reforms did not give them the choice. Allocation of money under the
reforms did not follow patients' wishes but went to 'where patients have
been assigned'.
The institute publishes a pamphlet today on the next stage of the reforms
contained in the National Health Service and Community Care Act  - changes
in provision for the long-term sick and elderly. Dr Green said these
reforms, coming into effect over the next few years, were retrograde and
would reduce elderly people's existing choice of care provision.
The institute would like individuals to be able to augment state spending on
the NHS through personal insurance arrangements - unlike the British Medical
Association, which is calling for increased public expenditure. While
proposed solutions vary, the current controversy over the health reforms has
made the adequacy of Britain's health care expenditure, which is low by
international standards, into a live political issue again.
The government is trying to shift the argument away from funding to the
outcome of health care. Later this month Mr William Waldegrave, health
secretary, will publish targets for monitoring and improving the nation's
health.
If the controversy over the reforms continues, however, there is a danger
for the government that the health targets exercise will become embroiled in
the heated argument over the adequacy of NHS funding.
The Association of Community Health Councils, which represents consumer
interests in the service, today joins criticism of the new general
practitioner fund-holding arrangements, under which some family doctors have
budgets and purchase hospital care for their patients.
For the first time, says the association, GPs will be subject to 'financial
risks' which may sometimes prevent them from providing the best care. In
other circumstances, fund holders might increase discrepancies in standards
by being able to negotiate favourable services for their patients.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: A long wait to journey's end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Friday night, May 3, just before I was due to spend the Bank Holiday
weekend with friends in Norman-dy I received a call from them warning me
that there were spasmodic strikes by the French engineers on the boats. On
checking with Sealink in Newhaven I was told that the 10.15am sailing next
day would probably go ahead as planned - information repeated at 7.30am the
following morning.
On arriving at Victoria in very good time for the 8.32am connection the
notice-board announced that the train had been cancelled, without any other
information whatever. On trekking across to the so-called international
information office, someone helpfully suggested that I take the evening
boat-train connection to Newhaven, but without any assurance that there
would be a sailing even then. It was a Sealink matter and British Rail could
not help.
The Sealink office in Victoria was of course firmly closed until at least
9am, by which time I would have missed several connections to the coast.
Fortunately a bomb scare led to the evacuation of the international
information office and of some platforms, thus delaying departures. I
happened to have in my pocket the telephone number of Sealink in Newhaven. I
was told initially that the sailing had been cancelled, only to be
interrupted by a further message that it was going ahead after all. That was
precious little use to me, as it was far too late to reach Newhaven by any
conceivable method. On persisting with this mild objection, I was told to
take the next train to Dover and that Sealink in Calais would provide
transport to Dieppe.
At Dover a Sealink hostess assured me that a message had been sent by radio
ahead and that I would be met in Calais, intelligence repeated by the ship's
purser. But of course there was no-one at Calais, where all the baggage was
sent on to the railway station on the assumption that every non-car
passenger was going on to Paris. I found one minor Sealink official who put
me back on an empty bus going back to the embarkation area, assuring me - I
fear correctly  - that no message of any kind had been sent.
I then had to wait until the Calais manager could be found, as he was
sorting out dockside problems. He was willing to arrange a taxi, so long as
the Dieppe manager accepted that the lapses had occurred on the
Newhaven-Dieppe stretch. There was another wait as the Dieppe man too was
'busy sorting out dockside problems'.
Normally I only drop names in the last few minutes when all else has failed.
But I was reduced to giving my profession, saying who my host was and that
we were having a business dinner and that an extremely prominent member of
the French cabinet, who lives in the neighbourhood, might drop in to join
us. But even if President Francois Mitterrand had been expected it would
probably not have helped. What mattered was to establish the responsibility
within Sealink. I even had to give a hypocritical defence of British Rail.
After I had cooled down over a cup of coffee a message came over the tannoy
that I was wanted downstairs and a proud Calais manager told me he had
persuaded Dieppe to pay for a taxi.
My journey back was 'normal.' This means that I had to queue for a long time
to get on and off the boat and carry my own luggage. And, despite '1992' and
having a British passport, I had to queue again on board for a landing
document.
What is the moral? Sealink was taken over last year by an international
concern, Stena Line, from Sea Containers. Somehow I think it would all have
been very different if there had been competition between different
companies to carry passengers on that particular crossing.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: An alibi for pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS STACEY.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, the apparent logic advanced for a few top businessmen's recent large
salary increases, as reported in the FT, has been (a) a bonus for the
previous year's good trading; (b) that non-executive (ie independent)
directors have determined and recommended the increase; (c) that a firm of
outside consultants (also independent) have recommended it.
Normally, the first of these reasons has much claim to merit as it is based
on performance. But it carries less weight in the present difficult times
when - as in the case of Prudential  - the rise was accompanied by a cut in
policyholders' bonus rates, by nine figure losses on forays into estate
agency and reduced profits.
The second and third reasons advanced cannot easily claim any such logic,
particularly if the companies whose boards have voted the increase have
suffered huge losses, as in the case of Midland Bank.
We live in a country of rising unemployment (with excessive wage
settlements), an increasing number of bankruptcies and a still unacceptably
high rate of inflation against which most people have little or no hedge.
Awarding company directors large salary increases seems particularly
unhelpful and insensitive in view of current economic conditions, even if
boards believe they have an alibi in the shape of outside consultants'
recommendations. In any event, the moral responsibility for the
implementation (or rejection) of such recommendations lies with the boards
which commissioned them.
The antennae of some company boards seem inadequately fine-tuned for
sensitivity. The disadvantages of living in an alibi society is that bad
judgments are too easily overlooked.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: Regulatory regime in need of direction - The
government must start to give its network of industry regulators a clearer
purpose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do contraceptives and salt have in common with domestic telephone
calls, the BBC television licence fee, commuter rail fares in the
south-east, gas and electricity charges?
The answer - after a decade of free-market reforms  - is that they all have
their prices controlled by regulatory authorities.
Regulation in the UK, as the diverse list of products and services suggests,
not only lacks coherence but is seldom free of controversy. Regulators have
sprung up in an ad hoc way, largely in response to political requirements,
as government has privatised industries and opened them up to competition.
The Broadcasting Act 1990 created no fewer than six regulators to oversee
the television industry, for instance.
All the regulators, from the Office of Fair Trading, the utilities - gas
(Ofgas), telecommunications (Oftel), electricity (Offer), water (Ofwat) -
aviation and television last week gathered for the first time to discuss
their role at a conference organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs.
Having created a patchwork of regulatory bodies the government is starting
to consider how to give them a clearer purpose. Mr Peter Lilley, the trade
and industry secretary is leading the way by addressing how his department's
regulatory responsibilities should be made more coherent.
To carry out a thoroughgoing review of the regulators' roles, particularly
where the privatised utilities are concerned, Mr Lilley's advisers will have
to tackle several questions:
What criteria should be used to assess whether a regulator is working
efficiently?
In telecommunications, for instance, there have been complaints that it has
taken Oftel far too long to determine the price and conditions under which
BT should make its network available to other operators. Comparisons with
regulation in other countries might be one way of judging British
regulators; more comparisons between the domestic regulators may be useful.
One possibility suggested at the conference by Mr Centro Veljnowski, an IEA
economist, was to set up a Whitehall audit unit to examine the costs and
benefits of regulation and deregulation.
Do regulators need to be more activist to represent consumer interests?
One of the regulators' main tasks is to protect consumers against utilities
with monopoly power. Yet according to Mr Maurice Healey, director of the
National Consumer Council, one of the main hindrances faced by regulators is
that they can only react to plans proposed by the companies they regulate;
they cannot suggest or stipulate what strategies the companies should
follow. When BT proposed charging for its directory inquiries service, Oftel
was not able to propose an alternative which consumers might have preferred.
It could only comment upon BT's plans, says Mr Healey.
What scope is there for the regulators to promote competition?
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of Oftel, recognises his task is
considerably eased by new technology which is opening up areas of
competition in telecommunications. Because of this he can challenge BT with
the prospect of entrants coming into the market with new technologies such
as mobile telephones or cable television.
At the other end of the spectrum is the water industry, where there are no
prospects of technology-driven competition. This has led Mr Ian Byatt, the
regulator, to adopt so-called 'yardstick competition'. After comparing the
performance and costs of different water companies, Mr Byatt will set prices
so that all companies have to match the standards set by the best in the
industry.
As other regulators run up against the realistic limits to competition in
their industries, they too may have to turn to 'yardstick competition' to
assess the efficiency of the companies they regulate.
What should be the responsibility of regulators in maintaining the social
aspects of services provided by utilities?
Take telecommunications. As a nationalised company BT ran a national
network, charging uniform prices, with revenues from more profitable
business services offsetting loss-making domestic and rural services.
Promoting access to the telephone was part of a social policy sanctioned by
governments of both parties.
As a privatised company, which faces growing competition, BT's services are
likely to become more tailored to different customer groups, which will be
charged different prices. There are concerns among Labour critics and trade
unions that less affluent, less profitable residential customers will be
overlooked in the new world of competition.
Oftel and the government will come under pressure to lay out a clear
framework for the relationship between the commercial and social aspects of
telecommunications markets and how these social obligations should be
financed. All the regulators will face this question of balancing social and
commercial demands once competition intensifies.
Should the regulators be more open in the way they reach decisions?
Agreements with the companies they regulate are often concluded in secrecy.
Although all the regulators conduct extensive research into their
industries, their conclusions are rarely published. Consumers cannot be sure
that the regulator has not been quietly 'captured' by the company it
regulates. This is one of the dangers of regulation: gradually the
regulators 'go native' and start promoting the interests of the industry
rather than those of the consumers.
In the US, regulation is much more open with hearings held at state and
federal level to inquire into company plans. The risk there is that this
quasi-judicial system, in which companies give evidence to public hearings,
makes the process adversarial and inflexible, says Mr Robert Osgood, a
specialist in US regulation with legal firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.
'There is another problem,' says Mr Osgood. 'Judges do not make a coherent
management team.'
Even if such a judicial system is rejected there is a case for requiring
greater openness from the regulators, perhaps modelled on select committee
inquiries. The regulators could hold bi-annual reviews of a company's
performance which would take evidence from interested parties. The
background to important decisions such as significant changes to price caps
should be made public.
Mr Byatt at Ofwat is leading the way in consulting consumers. His office
recently sent out 17m leaflets and held public meetings to seek consumer
views on plans to change the way people pay for water services.
Who should regulators be accountable to and how should they be held
accountable?
Regulators should serve consumers, yet their masters are really government
ministers. There is the additional danger that if the regulators evade the
influence of their companies, they may still be captured by politicians and
encouraged to bend to the demands of political expediency.
Yet, as the system of regulation is likely to remain a feature of these
industries for many years, it would make sense for the regulators to have a
power base independent of politicians. An alternative to appointment by
ministers would be for subscribers to utility services to elect regulators
on the basis of customer manifestos. Their power would then rest upon the
relationship with the consumers they serve rather than with ministers.
Should the regulators be brought together under one umbrella to create
greater coherence in their policies?
The idea of a regulator-in-chief has been proposed by the Labour party. It
sounds plausible but is probably unnecessary. All the utility regulators
rely on the support of the OFT and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Sir Bryan Carsberg says: 'The MMC's role as a backstop is very important to
underline our powers.'
In the gas industry, the MMC's inquiries in the industrial gas market were
one spur for Ofgas to take more radical action than it had planned. One
possibility would be for the MMC to be more active as an independent auditor
of the regulators' performance.
If the system has been successful with the privatised monopoly utilities,
could it be extended to other areas of monopoly which remain in the public
sector?
According to Mr Healey, the most important priority for consumers is that
responsibilities for owning a corporation and running a service should be
separated from those of regulating it. He says: 'This really opens up
significant new territory for consumers because it makes it much clearer
where responsibility lies for running a service and setting the standards it
should reach.'
A corporation with a monopoly in a service, which also sets the standards of
service it has to meet, is unlikely to set standards as exacting as those
set by an independent regulator.
British Rail and the Department of Transport between them own, run and
regulate the railways. Consumers regard BR and the department as the chief
culprits responsible for poor quality, only to find that these two
organisations are also judge and jury of consumer complaints.
Rather than wait for privatisation, why not establish Ofpost, for the Post
Office, Oftube, for the London Underground or Ofrail for British Rail to
give consumers a much clearer voice in decision making.
After all, this would be a return to the roots of regulation. The US
Interstate Commerce Commission, set up in 1887 as the first modern
regulatory agency, was modelled on the British Regulation of Railways Act of
1873, a regulatory scheme which the House of Commons soon after declared to
be a failure. For modern regulators to avoid such a fate they will need to
be ready to reform themselves as well as the industries they regulate.
The first article about Britain's regulators appeared on Wednesday March 13.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: Britain should heed Spain's proposal for Community
budget distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir MICHAEL FRANKLIN.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The British government might take the opportunity of Mr Felipe
Gonzalez's visit to London last week to think again about one aspect of its
European policy.
Spain has put high on its list of priorities for the current
intergovernmental conferences a change in the EC's financing arrangements to
ensure that the Community budget brings about adequate transfers from the
richer to the poorer member states. Such a concept has not endeared itself
to those in Britain who fear that it will only inflate EC spending still
further and that such transfers are unnecessary and wasteful.
No doubt much can and should be done to see that EC monies on regional and
social projects are properly used, but problems on this account do not
invalidate the argument for having a Community budget, whatever its size,
which is consciously redistributive. At present there are serious anomalies
with some of the richer EC member states being net beneficiaries.
If there was an override mechanism to make sure that the overall effect of
Community budget flows was as it ought to be - according to need and ability
to pay - there would be less need to distort the Community's individual
policies. In particular, countries both rich and poor which currently
benefit from the excessive expenditure on agricultural price support might
be less resistant to sensible reform of the Cap.
This in itself should commend the Spanish proposal to Britain. But there are
two other reasons. Since our GDP per head is around the EC average, we
should come out of a redistributive budget at least as well as under the
present arrangements. Second, since the present arrangements depend on a
special corrective mechanism negotiated with difficulty for Britain alone,
we should be much less exposed if they were replaced by something which was
really communautaire.

'At the beginning of my review, I stated that 1990 had been a difficult
year. For me, it was also a rewarding one.'
So says Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential Corporation, writing in
his annual report for 1990 - a year in which, it may be recalled, the Pru's
pre-tax profits rose 9 per cent and his salary rose 43 per cent.

Woody Allen, the American comedian, writer and film director, may not seem
the most obvious name to associate with the Italian Co-op, one of the
country's biggest retailers with almost L8,000bn (Pounds 3.6bn) in sales.
But shooting for a series of five 45-second TV commercials written and
directed by Allen is due to start soon.
It is not quite the first time Allen, best known for his films of New York
life, is making a commercial. An earlier project for the Campari drinks
group never got off the ground owing to problems over the script.
The scripts for the Co-op's new ads have already been delivered, although
executives at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in Italy, which has the Co-op account, are
sworn to secrecy as to their content.
However, word is that there is already some concern about the use of typical
Allen
characters drawn from the US east coast, such as the New York shrink, to
sell the fruits, vegetables and other foods promoted by the new ads.
Nevertheless, Italy's Co-op, which is both bigger and richer than most of
its European counterparts, is determined to go ahead, and may even try to
draw attention to its status-raising director by giving Allen an on-screen
credit at the end of each commercial.
The company is less keen to say how much he is being paid. Peter Falk, the
television detective 'Colombo', reportedly earned L700m for his Co-op ads
five years ago. Evidently, the company made the artistic Allen an offer he
couldn't refuse.

How easily great schemes can gang a-gley, especially when they're hatched by
the notoriously mother-tongue- bound British.
In discussions with the rest of Europe about economic and monetary union, UK
officials thought they'd hit on a wonderful idea for inching towards
agreement on a European central bank while keeping in British hands a goodly
portion of the country's gold and foreign currency reserves.
Under existing plans for union the UK's reserves would end up, along with
those of the other EC nations, in the coffers of the new central bank
instead of being locked away at the Bank of England.
Such a state of affairs would enrage Tory right-wingers, and make it harder
for the govern- ment to win parliament's backing for even a modest show of
UK support for Emu.
The officials' wheeze was to agree to the transfer of 'reserves' from
Britain to the new bank, but without specifying how much.
The plan foundered when the British side realised that the wording would
have to be translated into French - which insists on nouns having an
indefinite or definite article. Use of the prefix des, meaning 'some',
rather than the all-encompassing les, would have immediately given the game
away.

Tim Renton, Britain's arts minister and humble mortal, recently found
himself ushered into the presence of a God, blissfully unaware of the
protocol crisis which preceded the auspicious event.
One of Westminster's few true gentlemen and far better suited to being arts
supremo than Chief Whip, the Machiavellian assignment dumped on him by an
increasingly isolated Margaret Thatcher, Renton was heading for the Horniman
Museum to meet the Ooni of Ife, divine king of 15m Yoruba people in south
west Nigeria.
The legacy of a Victorian tea merchant, the Horniman collection embraces
artifacts and art from cultures and religious faiths around the world. Proud
owner of a stuffed walrus and its very own mummy, the museum has now added
an exhibition of Yoruba art, which Renton was invited to look over.
But the museum's big-wigs were unsure of the correct procedures to be
followed when a minister meets a god. After considerable anguish, it was
eventually decided that Renton need not kneel.
At the moment of their meeting, however, it was agreed that tom-toms would
sound - a salute considered sufficiently grand because the Ooni, it emerged,
is only a part-time god. Off-duty, the divinity is a commodities broker.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Observer: Viennese whirl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vienna may conjure up strains of Strauss and romantic images of nights at
the opera. But it seems self-respecting Saudis, used to only the most
luxurious of life-styles, regard a posting to the Austrian capital as a
positive hardship.
Hence the tough job faced by the Saudi delegation to the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in finding the right head for the cartel's
public relations department.
The lucky candidate is Mohammed Abdul-Aziz al-Sahlawi, who is reported to
have accepted only on condition that he also continues to draw his full
salary at home, where he is professor of economics at the King Fahd
University of Petroleum. Pecuniary wheeler-dealing apart, the appointment of
Sahlawi, a US-educated engineer, is a clear sign of Saudi Arabia's new
dominance within Opec.  This is the first time in 15 years that the world's
biggest oil exporter has put forward one of its own nationals for a senior
post inside the organisation.
The surprise decision also leaves a disgruntled Kemal Saiki, who has been
running the public relations side for the fractious oil producers for the
past year and had been promised the top job.
Alas, being Algerian, he's tarred by the Saudis with the same brush as
Opec's current president Sadek Boussena. Saudi Arabia is dissatisfied with
the way Boussena has managed Opec politics to meet his domestic agenda and
he will almost certainly be voted out of office in June.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Green hopes rise in a grey area: A new urgency in Brussels
to build an effective and coherent European Community environment policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, assembled the
chiefs of the EC's civil service in March to lambast them for lack of focus,
he alighted on the head of the environment directorate to make his point.
'I want an environment policy, not endless packages for migratory birds,' he
is quoted as saying by one of those on the receiving end of the
tongue-lashing.
Only weeks later he appears to have got one - a policy, moreover, which may
square two and a half of the three circles surrounding the Community's
environmental effort.
This has enabled Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, to
claim that 'we have reached a turning point in EC environmental policy . . .
a point where the environment and the single market are on an equal
footing'.
The claim seems large. Yet already there are signs of more streamlined
decision-making and greater effort to frame policies for all EC members.
Eventually, Brussels could have a much stronger hand in setting the 'green'
agenda. Controversially, it wants economic growth kept within bounds set by
what the environment can stand. As one example, the Commission would like a
'green tax' on all forms of non-renewable energy, to curb consumption.
Another concern for companies is the Commission's plan to get them to report
annually on their effect on the environment. Under current thinking these
'environmental audits' for industry would mostly be voluntary. But they
would be compulsory for larger companies in high 'eco-risk' sectors such as
chemicals and steel.
The edge of EC environmental policy is at present blunted by:
the normal requirement for unanimous approval of legislation by the EC
Council of Ministers, which tends to pull proposed standards down to the
lowest common denominator;
the consequential tendency of the richer, 'northern' member states to press
ahead unilaterally with stricter measures, which threaten to fragment the
single market;
the failure of the Community as a whole to match rhetoric - and even formal
policy - with action, classically instanced by member states' inability to
agree on a site for the European Environment Agency (EEA) which they voted
to set up a year ago.
Mr Ripa di Meana's optimism will be borne out only if the Commission's new
environmental offensive progresses on all three of these fronts. Brussels
has advertised this new determination by asking the member states to make
the Treaty of Rome 'greener'. It has asked the inter-governmental conference
on political union, which is revising the treaty, to change the rules so
that environmental legislation is decided by qualified majority vote in the
Council - as most single market directives already are. This form of voting,
instead of unanimity, requires a weighted majority, with the largest member
states commanding the most votes.
The Commission also wants the treaty to commit the EC to 'sustainable
growth', and to require environmental criteria to be integrated into other
Community policies. 'Never before has the Commission so clearly stated that
we have to get equal status between the environment and growth - without
which growth itself is put at risk,' the green bespectacled environment
commissioner enthuses.
If endorsed by the inter-governmental conference, the proposed changes in
voting requirements could raise standards significantly for legislation on
the environment. In strict procedural terms, the unanimity rule is waived
only when the Council decides unanimously it will vote by majority. 'I doubt
whether Jonathan Swift at his best could have thought of that particular
formula,' snorts Mr Ken Collins, the Labour MEP who heads the influential
environment committee of the European Parliament.
One Commission official says a change in voting rules will achieve a 'middle
common denominator', whereby environment provisions will be less quickly
'overtaken by time, events and technological developments'. He cited the
Commission's most glowing recent success: tight controls on car and lorry
emissions pushed through in the past 10 months. The parliament cajoled the
Commission into setting high standards and presenting them to Council as the
'harmonisation' of national regulations.
This device exploits a grey area in the treaty as amended by the Single
European Act. To use the device the Commission must prove that the
environmental measure it proposes is dealing with distortion of competition.
Four out of nine pieces of law examined by environment ministers in March
passed this test.
But despite this advance, member state challenges to majority voting are
becoming more frequent. The Commission's lawyers and the European Court of
Justice, moreover, monitor use of single market procedures for environmental
measures.
The UK, for example, may well challenge the Commission's choice of majority
voting for its proposals to standardise landfill operations for waste
disposal. This case poses the dilemma acutely. The Commission feels certain
it could not win unanimity for a worthwhile law. Yet under current provision
for majority voting, member states can ignore or go far beyond what is
agreed - creating the vision was designed to iron out.
But the success of the vehicle emissions legislation which emerged under
this procedure has yielded an interim, more richly-textured device, which
the Commission has adopted as its new policy framework. Its goal is to
prevent the richer and greener EC members with stricter rules from
contributing to a 'two-speed' Europe.
The new framework aims to bridge an EC north-south divide, reining back
states such as Germany and Netherlands, which have tougher standards, and to
lash forward countries such as Spain and Portugal which see less need for,
and can less easily affordsuch standards.
From now on, the Commission proposes a two-stage approach, modelled on the
vehicles emissions legislation: a first, compulsory package of laws,
followed by parallel, more stringent targets for the Community as a whole to
aim at, but which individual member states can progress towards at their own
speed. Fiscal incentives can be used to speed up the obligatory standards
and - only after these have been achieved EC-wide - to bring forward the
tougher norms.
The intention is to end the chaotic proliferation of national incentives
which are threatening to undermine Brussels competition policy. Germany, for
instance, has tried unilaterally to introduce vehicle emission standards
beyond current EC policy through tax concessions on cars incorporating
advanced catalytic converters. This would give such cars a price advantage,
and possibly constitute a barrier to imports of cars falling below these
standards.
Just as important, if some member states were to follow their own green
path, the credibility of a common environmental policy would be shredded.
This would undermine the Commission's ability to enforce viable measures on
the EC as a whole.
But the success of the automotive package, appears to be encouraging more
aggressive thinking inside the Commission on how to achieve a balance of
incentives and disincentives for environmental ends.
No one would accuse the ebullient Italian commissioner himself of thinking
small. His most ambitious project is undoubtedly for a mixed carbon and
energy tax, in line with the EC's commitment last October to stabilise
carbon dioxide emissions at their 1990 level by 2000.
When an embryonic plan for a straight 'CO tax' leaked two years ago it was
derided as lunatic. 'Then, I was just caressing it,' Mr Ripa di Meana
recalls fondly, 'but now, we have won the right to discuss it.'
In improbable alliance with Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the conservative
energy commissioner from Portugal, Mr Ripa di Meana has developed a more
rounded proposal which the European Council is to report on by July. His own
deadline for action is 'the other 1992' - next April's world climate
conference in Brazil, where a convention to combat global warming is
supposed to be signed.
The plan - which the Commission may still water down  - has been refined to
keep the 12 together, and to emphasise competitive advantage.
The core idea is that while a levy on fossil fuels according to their carbon
content would provide the greatest incentive to reduce emissions, it would
fall most heavily on coal, then oil, and last, gas, while not touching
nuclear energy. This would have an uneven effect across the EC, penalising,
say, Spain, while rewarding France's extensive nuclear capacity.
But a CO levy with a tax on non-renewable energy sources would even out the
effect, and could, the Commission believes, be introduced in a fiscally
neutral way by member states. The risk of the Community not acting jointly
is, once again, that Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands will go ahead with
their own, potentially market-distorting plans.
The second emphasis is therefore to sell throughout the EC the merits of a
so-called 'no regrets strategy'. This means it should have clear
shorter-term benefits, competitive and environmental, to compensate for the
scientific uncertainty about the long-term effects of global warming.
Mr Jos Delbeke, senior economist in the Commission's environment directive,
has listed the benefits for the Centre for European Policy Studies
think-tank. These included improved energy efficiency and security;
diminished acid rain; more efficient transport policy, and relief of traffic
congestion (which the single market will exacerbate); a catalyst to industry
to bring on line new capital goods and technology which uses less energy and
fewer raw materials. 'Japan has a comparative advantage in terms of
energy-efficient equipment . . . and that is the market of the future,' Mr
Delbeke underlines; a fillip for greater harmonisation of fiscal policy; and
greater macroeconomic convergence within the EC through common transport and
energy policies.
Nice balance would be needed, with offsets to ensure no loss of
competitiveness, Mr Delbeke stresses. 'It is not the idea to create
deserts.'
Balance of a different sort - the 'you-scratch-my-back' variety  - has
prevented the EC from agreeing on a location for the European Environment
Agency. France wants a deal on the location of the EEA (Copenhagen and
Madrid are front-runners) to be made conditional on confirmation of
Strasbourg as the permanent home of the European Parliament.
Mr Ripa di Meana's anger at France's de facto veto is matched only by his
scorn at her partners' refusal to dirty their hands in the dispute. Without
the EEA, many other of his legislative ambitions will be stalled.
The agency's core job will be to gather accurate statistics on the EC
environment. But it is also the key to a storehouse of measures, including:
'eco-labelling', a plan to institute an awards system for
environment-friendly products; and plans to introduce annual environmental
audits for industry. In the absence of these measures, national labels
following different standards, and voluntary audits without guidelines
allowing comparison, are proliferating. The EEA is also vital for regular
updating of existing directives, taking in technological advances member
states might otherwise incorporate on their own.
Mr Ripa di Meana says he will shortly be publishing a report on the EEA
fiasco deliberately intended to embarrass the member states. 'To have here
blackmail - and that is the word to be used  - is not acceptable,' he
vituperates. Harsh words, but the environment will not be seen to be on the
same priority level as the 1992 programme until battles such as those over
the siting of the EEA are won.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Rudolf Serkin - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rudolf Serkin died in Vermont on May 8, aged 88, and with his death the 20th
century has lost one of its greatest pianists. He was born in Bohemia in
1903 of Russian parents, studied in Vienna (where one of his composition
teachers was Schoenberg) and made his debut with the Vienna Symphony at the
age of 12.
It was a concert with the Busch Chamber Orchestra in Berlin in 1920, though,
that led to his enduring association with the Busch family. He became Adolf
Busch's recital partner in duos and trios, appeared regularly with the Busch
Quartet and married Adolf's daughter Irene in 1935; their son Peter, has
become a challenging pianist in his own right. In 1939 the Serkins emigrated
to the United States, where he was to become head of piano at the Curtis
Institute in Philadelphia, and in 1950 to start the Marlboro Music Festival
and School with Adolf and Hermann Busch.
While Serkin established his reputation as one of the most authoritative and
musically disciplined interpreters of the Viennese tradition, he was also
from his earliest days a superlative chamber musician, first within the
Busch dynasty but later with other distinguished groups such as the Budapest
Quartet.
He was never a flamboyant technician; his piano tone was always eloquent
rather than seductive. But he was a profound thinking musician who placed
his considerable powers strictly at the service of the music he respected so
deeply.
Though his programmes ranged into the dustier corners of the repertory,
including the piano works of Mendelssohn, Reger and Strauss, Serkin's art
was always centred upon the Viennese classics; his Mozart piano concertos
(he returned to them in his 80s for a last series of recordings with Abbado)
had limpid grace and lyrical strength, his Beethoven was searching, never
pedantic, his Schubert often starkly dramatic. Perhaps his accounts of the
Brahms concertos demonstrated his intellectual grasp most magnificently,
with their ability to encompass rhetorical grandeur and the most careful
introspection in a single dramatic sweep.
In his last years his performances were sometimes erratic, pared down to the
point of gruffness, but the dedication and self-effacing demeanour of his
playing remained. And at its best it could still sustain a tradition that
appears to us now as descended from a golden age, which had fashioned Serkin
into one of its peerless interpreters.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Off-Met opera, New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The New York conservatories provide some of the city's happiest operatic
adventures. At the Mannes School, we have had Gluck's Paride ed Elena in an
enchanting performance. Paride was the third, and is the most beautiful, of
the three reform operas that Gluck and Calzabigi wrote for Vienna. And
unlike Orfeo and Alceste it was not revised and commercialised for Paris. In
these pages 28 years ago, I wrote with rapture of a Royal Manchester College
production with Ryland Davies and Anne Howells among the student performers.
If Paride has not captured the world's smaller stages, it may be because its
cast is five sopranos (Davies sang Paris an octave down), or because its
five acts trace but a single action, Helen's surrender to Paris's wooing.
But they trace it with such psychological subtleties  - the letters in
Ovid's Heroides are the source of the libretto - and with such musical
beauty that listeners remain spellbound. Paris lands in Sparta as a playboy,
but falls deeply and truly in love.
Like Orfeo, Paride is at once an opera about and a demonstration of music's
power to touch the heart. The long, harp-accompanied aria that Paris sings
in Act 3, hypnotically beautiful, begins the conquest of Helen's scruples;
by Act 5, although Pallas Athene warns the lovers that dreadful, destructive
war attends the surrender of reason and decency to emotion, and although
they understand the warning, erotic force proves irresistible. The opera,
despite its bright C-major ending, is a tragedy, both stirring and profound.
The score was given uncut (for the first time since 1770?). The performance,
in the salon of the Mannes School - once a convent refectory - was unstaged
(no decor, no dancers) but was enacted. It had been prepared and was
conducted by Will Crutchfield, who had worked long with his student singers,
inspiring them with a feeling for words, tone, sense, and style that made
the performance moving and memorable. The Gluckian miracle of poise and
formality united with keen, direct emotional expression was achieved.
Natalie Arduino was Paris, Laura Danehower was Helen, and Elizabeth Wiley
was Cupid. The opera was sung in Italian.
The Juilliard Opera Center gave us a Verdi Falstaff, conducted by Julius
Rudel, that was not intolerable but had nothing special to offer. The
Juilliard drama students put on a happy Happy End that was exciting from
start to finish. The Salvation Army libretto - lyrics by Brecht, 'book' by
Elisabeth Hauptmann, English adaptation by Michael Feingold - may be
ramshackle, but Weill's songs are stunning and stirring. And the drama
students, produced by Moni Yakim, put the piece across with irresistible
verse and adresse. It was an athletic, very 'physical' production. I hope
the Falstaff cast - singing dummies, most of them - saw it, and resolved to
'register' for the instruction in 'body communication' and in getting words
across. Deborah Lapidus conducted.
At the Fashion Institute of Technology, Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods
was revived. The FIT institutional auditorium is a drear place. Into the
Woods has its points, but it is a feeble score, and at FIT patchy, murky,
word-killing amplification of the singers, and coarse balance between the
orchestra and the stage, obscured the wit of the words and dulled the zest
of the young performers. Amplification, like surtitling, is evidently here
to stay, but let it be technically competent.
Let two other productions, not student, round off the picture of off-Met New
York opera. L'Opera Francais de New York offered a delectable double bill in
Florence Gould Hall - an elegant little theatre tucked deep beneath a
commercial building on Madison Avenue. They were Gretry's Les Deux Avares
and Bizet's Le Docteur Miracle. The Gretry is OK; the Bizet - London first
saw it in the theatre of Londonderry House, now demolished, with an
unforgettable performance by Johanna Peters - is a miniature masterpiece.
Yves Abel conducted it as such, and Sharon Azraeli was a winning heroine.
These were concert performances, but a staged Iphigenie en Tauride is
promised next.
Amato Opera plays in a down-town garage converted into a cosy little gem of
a tiny opera house where everything tells. Here many singers now famous -
Mignon Dunn, George Shirley, Neil Shicoff  - made early appearances. And
here Verdi's I due Foscari has been playing - for eight performances, each
of them with a different cast. Anthony Amato, the conductor and producer of
the enterprise, is an instinctual genius, a born interpreter of 19th-century
Italian opera. He gets the tempi, the rubato and the accommodations to the
strengths and the failings of the particular singers exactly right. He
should surely be conducting at the Met. And in Richard Cerullo he has a
designer who works wonders on a shoestring and clothes 19th-century operas
in apt, attractive scenery.
The Due Foscari I heard was not well sung; I doubt whether any of its
performers will go on to achieve Met fame. But it was sung with a
communicativeness that brought the opera to life. (Whereas in grander, more
pretentious performances in huge houses operas often die.) A skeleton
representation of Verdi's orchestra - piano filling in what was missing -
played the score. But the clarinet was eloquent, and the music came across
and told, keenly.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Pop is the tops - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What are we to make of the current state of arts sponsorship? On the one
hand a bank cancelled a party to celebrate a sponsorship and tried to sell
on the deal, at a discount, because it did not want to be associated with
supporting an arts event while making staff redundant; on the other hand
Glyndebourne has raised over Pounds 20m from business inside a year to
finance its new opera house.
The bank is being over-cautious, and companies are helping Glyndebourne not
so much for love of opera but because they want the pay-off - a 20 year
guarantee of access to Glyndebourne tickets for entertainment purposes. The
money helps the arts but via the dubious route of corporate hospitality, and
it doubtless comes from a different budget.
Remarkably few sponsorships have been cancelled by the recession - as yet.
The problems will arise next year when current commitments lapse and talks
on renewal stall. But chief executives are already trying to cut back on
sponsorship where feasible. If the London City Ballet gives up next month
(and there are reports that, despite being promised an Arts Council grant
for 1992-93, the management is determined to stop dancing) the Pounds
800,000 committed by business to the LCB will not be switched to other arts
companies but disappear into corporate funds. That, at least, is the line
taken by one backer, Barclays Bank.
So far the Japanese continue to support the arts and the 1991 Japan Festival
in the UK has raised Pounds 15m from business. The oil companies are still
committed and last month Mobil announced another Pounds 125,000 sponsorship,
the Greensight Project, which develops educational packs for schools,
exploring the relationships between industry and the environment through the
making of video programmes.
But the odds must be against the renewal of such major sponsorships as the
Prudential Awards and Shell-Bafta when these Pounds 1m plus projects draw to
a close within the next 12 months. The worst is yet to come.
The Royal Academy is probably more adept than any other arts organisation at
attracting sponsorship. It has to be; it receives no government aid. But
even the RA is rather impressed with the Pounds 600,000 guarantee against
loss it has conjured up at the last moment for its Pop Art Show, opening on
September 13. Not only is this its biggest ever lifebelt but it is a record
sponsorship for any art show in the UK.
The bulk of the money, Pounds 500,000, comes from Mercury Communications,
with the rest from The Independent. The show, the first major survey of Pop
Art for over 20 years, is so expensive to put on because of its size - both
in the number of pictures that need to be transported, over 200, and the
size of some of them.
To prove it has no favourites the Pop Art Show will still be running when an
exhibition of prints by the Japanese artist Hokusai opens in November -
sponsored by Mercury's rival, British Telecom.
Before Pop there are the Fauves, opening in June and backed by Ford. At the
same time the RA will unveil its new look galleries, named after the Sackler
family which has given over Pounds 1m for the facelift. The refurbished
galleries provide the chance of a re-hang of the RA's own over-looked art
collection, paid for by Texaco, which is becoming a force in arts
sponsorship.
On October 4 Chicago opens its new public library, a nine storey
neo-classical monolith which occupies a whole down town block. This major
event, the culmination of a 70 year campaign, will be celebrated with a week
of junketings, thanks to WH Smith which is contributing Dollars 300,000 to
pay for the ceremonies.
This is not unthinking philanthropy on the part of the UK's leading
bookseller. WH Smith began trading in the US in 1985 and is a major presence
in the massive O'Hare Airport in Chicago where it operates 21 shops. It also
functions at five hotels in the city. Already a big name among the
travelling public in the Midwest, WH Smith is keen to make friends with more
sedentary readers.
British Gas may lack a structure to its arts sponsorships, but no one can
fault its variety. On April 30 it announced the winners of the first Arts
Council/British Gas 'Working for Cities' Awards, and the next night it
backed the Toronto Symphony Orchestra's Barbican concert.
'Working for Cities' is about the role of the arts in urban regeneration and
the main winners were: for art in public places - the Broadgate in London;
for people - Neville Campbell of Phoenix Dance in Leeds; for buildings - Tic
Toc in Coventry; for events  - the NGR 90 Festival at Gateshead; for
partnership - Fish Quay, North Tyneside; in the pipeline - Riverfront
Promenade, Newport.
The Barbican concert was in complete contrast - old fashioned patronage and
corporate hospitality because British Gas has bought Consumer Gas of Ontario
and wants to make friends in Canada.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Tosca - Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At regular intervals, for the sake of operatic health and decency, it is
proper to recall Joseph Kerman's stern dictum: 'Tosca, that shabby little
shocker, is no doubt admired nowadays mostly in the gallery.' When the
melodramatic grip fails, what we discover is a showman carefully tormenting
clockwork mice. Saturday's revival at the Royal Opera stayed more or less
afloat on waves of generous response from the stalls, rather than the
gallery. For this was a performance in the annual Midland Bank Proms week -
probably the best thing to have happened to Covent Garden since the Second
World War - and un-jaded enthusiasm is always on tap.
This was what used to be the Zeffirelli production, now staged by John Cox
in the handsome old designs of Mongiardino and Escoffier (with sponsorship
by Bankers Trust Company). Rather less strikingly lit than before, if memory
serves, and certainly less persuasively enacted, but no one person is to
blame. What we have is a curdled international brew. No Italians, but
ultra-professional American tenor and bass who have to hold their own
against an admired German soprano and a distinguished French conductor,
neither of them born to do anything at all with Puccini.
To the luckless Cavaradossi, Neil Shicoff brings his customary high
definition and reckless energy, firing top notes into the house like laser
beams. There were places where he and the conductor Michel Plasson were not
on the same wave-length (even in 'E lucevan le stelle'). Samuel Ramey's
Scarpia, in gleaming black voice, preens and looms - utterly faithful to the
words, which come up in the English surtitles with scarifying grossness. Not
for the first time, I thought that Ramey was over-painting the sleek menace
which his physiognomy and stature already guarantee; even Scarpia needs some
down-to-earth, human touches.
There is a good, hunted Angelotti from Stephen Gadd, and Eric Garrett
repeats his bouncing, twinkling Sacristan. (It is a horrid role; a bit of
Verdi's Fra Melitone and some echoes of Wagner's David, in aid of nothing
but making a crude contrast with the desperation of the young rebels.) For
the unseen Shepherd Boy, Daniel Ison's treble has a nice, natural plangency.
That leaves Hildegard Behrens, whose great virtues in the German repertoire
are well recognised. As Tosca, her Italian is almost completely
unintelligible (except the spoken lines, which she emits in a weird,
slow-motion growl); so is her phrasing, which betrays not a trace of feeling
for Puccini's elegantly drooping curves. In the slow romantic passages - and
in much music which should not be slow at all - Plasson was downright
sluggish (the beginning of Act 3 seemed interminable), cruelly exposing the
threadbare timbre of the Behrens middle register.
It was a blessing that she remained bright and secure at the top; but 'Vissi
d'arte', done as a tear-wracked effusion, was a fearsome exercise in
non-style. Her dramatic outbursts were generally safer, with a strong suit
in sheer physical revulsion against Scarpia's blandishments. Whether with
Scarpia or with Cavaradossi, however, she seemed curiously insulated; nobody
really played to anybody else. We were being treated to independent solo
turns - which do not add up to an effective Tosca.
Expert pacing of the score would have been a help, and many an expert hack
could have supplied it. Plasson is no hack, and his civilised hand is so
sure in the French repertoire it was astonishing to hear this opera limping
cautiously along, bland and fuzzy in attack. In the first act only the frank
scherzo-music had any spark; the playful and mischievous moments which need
to enliven Tosca's scene with her lover came out like squeezed toothpaste.
By contrast, the climaxes were often raw and overblown. And for the
ironically twisted execution-march Plasson chose a funereal tempo which left
it dead.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Economics: Market to focus on likely RPI fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a lot for the market to focus on in the UK, with the performance of
the Conservatives in Thursday's parliamentary by-election in Monmouth coming
under scrutiny before the release of the retail prices index the following
day.
Well-highlighted by Treasury ministers has been the likely fall in the RPI
on Friday to around 6.2 per cent in April from March's 8.2 per cent.
The Treasury has twice used a fall in the RPI as a trigger point for a 1/2
 percentage point cut in the bank base rate. The question this week will be
whether the government wants to relax monetary policy ahead of Thursday's
vote or at the time of a perceived easing in inflationary pressures.
However, the market was warned last week that underlying inflation remained
stubborn. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said
the fall would reveal no more than the effect of last year's imposition of
the community charge dropping out of the 12-month figures, aided by recent
interest-rate reductions. Whatever the Conservatives' electoral plans, the
money market expects a  1/2 point cut in interest rates to 11 1/2 per cent
next week. Unemployment figures are set to show another very steep rise
after March's record jump of 113,000.
In the US, expectation of the Federal Reserve easing interest rates again
could mount. While a small rise in tomorrow's consumer prices index is
possible, further weakness in retail sales and industrial production will be
evident.
Other notable events and statistics, with market forecasts from MMS
International, the financial research company, in brackets include:
Today: UK, credit business for March (Pounds 125m) and final retail sales
(3.7 per cent). Canada, housing starts for April. Germany, wholesale prices
in-dex for April. Basle, Bank of International Settlements meeting.
Tomorrow: US, consumer prices index (0.2 per cent), retail sales (0.4 per
cent), industrial production (0.0 per cent), capacity utilisation for April
(78.6 per cent), Federal Open Markets Committee. Japan, machinery orders for
April. UK, provisional producer prices indices for April (input, 0.8 per
cent, output up 0.9 per cent to an annual 6.1 per cent), acquisitions and
mergers, first quarter, capital issues and redemptions.
Wednesday: US, business inventories for March (0.5 per cent), Canada,
important wage settlements. Australia, first quarter consumer price index
(0.4 per cent).
Thursday: UK, labour market statistics, provisional unemployment (up 85,000)
and unfilled vacancies for April, provisional average earnings indices for
March (9.25 per cent), productivity and unit wage costs (11.5 per cent),
provisional figures of vehicle production, index of output of the production
industries for March (manufacturing down 0.9 per cent, ind. prod down 0.7
per cent), capital expenditure by the manufacturing industries, financing of
the public sector borrowing requirement for the first quarter, monetary
statistics. Bank of England quarterly bulletin. Germany, Bundesbank meeting.
US, money supply, initial claims.
Friday: UK, public sector borrowing requirement for April (Pounds 2.75bn),
retail prices index and tax and price index for April (1.1 per cent). US,
merchandise trade for March (down Dollars 5.5bn).

FT  13 MAY 91 / Trials of setting a date in court: Delays surrounding the
Guinness case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE second trial arising out of the Guinness affair, which had been
scheduled to start last week, seems unlikely to begin before October.
Earlier dates are still being mooted, but there is a growing feeling that,
because of outstanding appeals and the approach of the season when witnesses
and judges like to go on holiday, the autumn is the most realistic prospect
for the start of the trial.
Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, and
Lord Spens, former director of corporate finance at Henry Ansbacher, are due
to stand trial accused of involvement in an unlawful share support operation
mounted by Guinness in 1986 during its bitterly-fought takeover battle with
the Argyll supermarket group for Distillers, the Scottish drinks group.
After several postponements the case, which is expected to last between
three and four months, had been scheduled to get under way at Southwark
Crown Court ion London last Tuesday. However, because of appeals by Mr
Seelig and Lord Spens against pre-trial rulings by Mr Justice Henry, and
appeals by three of those convicted in the first Guinness trial last year,
that fixture was not met and further delays became inevitable.
Mr Seelig and Lord Spens want to challenge in the House of Lords the Court
of Appeal's rejection of their appeal against Mr Justice Henry's ruling that
evidence they gave to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors
investigating Guinness can be used by the prosecution at the trial.
The two men argue that the inspectors should have cautioned them against
self-incrimination and that the failure to caution makes it unfair for their
evidence to be used at the trial.
It is an issue which is central to current concern about the powers given to
those investigating fraud and the absence of a right to silence for those
suspected of white-collar crimes.
A prerequisite for an appeal to the Lords is for the Appeal Court to certify
that the case raises a question of law of general public importance, which
it will be asked to do this week. If that hurdle is surmounted the court
will either give leave to appeal or tell Mr Seelig and Lord Spens they must
seek leave direct from the Law Lords.
Unless there are grounds for expedition, the time lapse between a Lords
appeal being lodged and heard is at least six months, which would suggest a
hearing date no earlier than November.
Even if expedited, an appeal lodged this month would be unlikely to come on
before October, because of the legal summer vacation in August and
September. Given that the Law Lords' rulings are not normally handed down
until four to six weeks after a hearing, the trial date could well be pushed
back towards the end of the year.
Mr Seelig and Lord Spens have waited more than three years to come before a
jury, Mr Seelig having been arrested on October 15 1987 and Lord Spens on
March 10 1988.
The prosecution of the seven men originally charged in the Guinness affair
was transferred from Bow Street magistrates court to Southwark Crown Court
in November 1988, when it was expected that the trial would begin the
following summer. By June 1989 the date had been moved to the following
January. In October 1989 Mr Justice Henry decided on split trials, with Mr
Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman and chief executive, in both,
and with Mr Seelig, Lord Spens and Mr David Mayhew, senior corporate finance
partner of Cazenove &amp; Co, the stockbrokers, alongside him in the dock in the
second trial.
When the first trial began in mid-February last year it was anticipated that
the second would start the following October. When Guinness One ended in
late August, however, Guinness Two was pushed back to January 14.
Mr Saunders, who had been convicted on all but one of the charges he had
faced in the first trial, was dropped from the second.
Shortly before Christmas the second trial was split, hiving off Mr Mayhew to
be tried in Guinness Three.
Since the beginning of this year legal arguments and appeals, coupled with
Lord Spens' new lawyers' need for more time to prepare his defence, have
resulted in further postponements.
Originally both defendants were represented by QCs, junior barristers and
solicitors. In April 1989 Lord Spens announced that he could no longer
afford the mounting legal costs and was dropping his lawyers.
Last November he was granted legal aid, however, and will be defended at the
trial by two junior barristers and solicitors.
Last year Mr Seelig also decided he could no longer afford legal
representation and has since conducted his own defence.
The two men are jointly charged under section 13 of the Prevention of Fraud
(Investments) Act with conspiring to induce Distillers shareholders to
exchange their holdings for shares in Guinness by the dishonest concealment
of material facts.
Mr Seelig alone faces a similar charge under the same act, as well as two
charges of false accounting. Lord Spens is charged with one false-accounting
offence.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Minister confirms aid to films
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday confirmed its plan for a National Film Commission
to attract foreign investment in the film industry.
The plan, first mooted last June by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime
minister, was outlined by Lord Hesketh, minister responsible for the film
industry, at the 44th international film festival in Cannes. It follows the
announcement of a Pounds 5m package to help UK film makers set up
co-production with their more subsidised continental counterparts.
The commission will be funded by the Department of Trade and Industry with a
budget of Pounds 3.5m spread over four years. Mr Sydney Samuelson, the
chairman of Samuelsons, international film production company, has been
appointed the first national film commissioner.
The role of the commission will include giving advice on taxation schemes,
work permits and location schedules.
The measures have been criticised by some film makers and the Labour party
as insufficient because they do not include special tax incentives.
The ailing UK film industry has been pressing for quicker write-offs,
reduction of the withholding tax on foreign actors and changes to make the
Business Expansion Scheme more suitable to finance feature films.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Doubts over the future of N Ireland power chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is facing renewed controversy over its plans to privatise
Northern Ireland's electricity supply industry amid reports that the chief
executive of Northern Ireland Electricity, Mr Anthony Hadfield, is to be
removed by his own board.
NIE yesterday denied a report that Mr Hadfield had been sacked. It would not
comment on a separate report that Mr Hadfield's three-year contract would
not be renewed when it expires in July.
However Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, said last
night that according to reliable information he had received, a decision was
taken 10 days ago by NIE's board.
Mr McNamara, with other Northern Ireland MPs, has publicly attacked the
government's decision to break up and privatise NIE, the public utility
which has a virtual monopoly in the province.
Mr Hadfield, who is also deputy NIE chairman, was expected to play an
important role in the privatisation process. According to some MPs, NIE
managers and senior trade union officials his removal from the board could
put a question mark over the future of the government's plans.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Constructing defences against terrorist attacks: A company
in County Londonderry that refuses to give in to IRA intimidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESILIENT is a word often used to describe the people of Northern Ireland.
In spite of all the killings and bombings of the past 20 years the
province's population shows determination to carry on with normal life.
Mr John Henry is an example. He runs one of Northern Ireland's biggest
construction companies, in Magherafelt, County Londonderry. It is much like
any other large builder's yard, bustling with trucks, but the security
checks, the vehicles in the company car park with bullet-proof windows and
the surveillance cameras tell a different story.
Mr Henry's privately run Henry Bros is the main company in Northern Ireland
carrying out construction work for the security forces - the army and the
Royal Ulster Constabulary. It is a very risky business. The IRA describes
those who carry out such work as 'legitimate targets'.
Mr Henry says: 'The IRA always comes for us. Unlike other companies, we see
no reason to hide what we do.'
The price for such openness has been high. In the past four years alone
several people who were associated with the company, including Mr Henry's
brother, have been murdered by the IRA.
Company drivers have been shot at and the Henry Bros premises have been
attacked with car bombs and mortars. In 1986 a manager at the Magherafelt
plant was shot by the IRA as he sat in his car. The IRA had mistaken him for
Mr Henry.
Eighteen months ago a supplier to the company - a cousin of Mr Henry's wife
 -was blown up in his car.
Earlier this year the IRA abducted a company employee and forced him to
drive a 'proxy bomb' to a nearby army base. The employee was lucky enough to
escape before the massive bomb exploded.
Mr Henry and many of his employees endure a besieged existence. Mr Henry is
under constant police guard and he drives an armour-plated car. His company
yard and his house are kept under constant surveillance.
A quietly spoken, genial man, Mr Henry feels the pressure. 'It's when I go
to Scotland or away somewhere that I realise just what it's like to relax.
Here you can't let down your guard for one second.'
Mr Henry, a Protestant, started his company in the mid 1970s. He was once in
partnership with two Roman Catholics, but they sold out after IRA
intimidation.
Most of Mr Henry's 600 employees are Protestant. He says IRA intimidation
prevents Catholics from joining the company.
There have been times when Mr Henry has felt like giving up. One of his
murdered brother's sons became involved with Protestant paramilitaries and
is now serving a 12-year jail sentence. Last year one of Mr Henry's own sons
was killed in an industrial accident.
'My family urge me to carry on. We have lost family members and employees,
but we are also in the business of saving lives,' he says.
Henry Bros builds and installs heavily reinforced steel and concrete
structures to protect police stations and army posts, as well as
bullet-proof windows and blast-proof doors for government offices and
residences of senior officials.
The company does much of its own research and collaborates with a company in
Germany which specialises in counter terrorism and security.
Army observation posts, called 'sangers', are built at the Magherafelt
plant. The walls of the sangers consist of two layers of inch-thick steel
sandwiching slabs of concrete.
'You always have to think about what the IRA will come up with next,' says
Mr Henry. 'Now they are using horizontally launched mortars which can even
pierce one of these sangers.'
Henry Bros' business involves high risk, but it is also profitable. Five
years ago company turnover was Pounds 5m. Last year it was Pounds 22m.
The company has been forced into being as self-sufficient as possible.
Three years ago the IRA sent cards to 30 of Henry Bros' leading suppliers,
saying that if they continued selling goods to the company, funerals would
follow.
'It had great effect. All our big suppliers refused to do business with us.
We felt betrayed. We even had to start buying cement from Poland instead of
locally,' Mr Henry says.
'If all the energy and skills we put into this business could instead be
concentrated on exports, Northern Ireland could achieve a great deal,' he
points out. Henry Bros is hoping for export orders - for its bullet-proof
windows.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Sunday trading appeal to Law Lords today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG legal battle over Sunday trading in England and Wales will enter
its final stage today when the Law Lords begin hearing an appeal by B&amp;Q, the
do-it-yourself chain, which will determine whether the Sunday trading laws
are incompatible with European law.
B&amp;Q is appealing against a ruling by Mr Justice Hoffmann in the High Court
last July that the 1950 Shops Act, which governs Sunday trading, does not
contravene the free-trade principles of European Community law.
The case concerns High Court injunctions granted to two councils banning B&amp;Q
from opening its stores at Norwich and Stoke on Trent on Sundays.
The Shops Act makes local authorities the prosecuting bodies for breaches of
the law. As a result enforcement is patchy across the country. Some councils
pursue any breach of the law while others turn a blind eye.
The maximum penalty for Sunday trading is a Pounds 1,000 fine for any one
store on any one Sunday. Local authorities can also seek High Court
injunctions to prevent breaches of the Shops Act.
Because some stores can make as much as Pounds 500,000 profit a year from
opening on Sundays, the Pounds 1,000 penalty has not proved an effective
deterrent. Local authorities have turned increasingly to injunctions as the
best way of banning Sunday trading over the past two years.
Two weeks ago, however, the effectiveness of these injunctions was thrown
into doubt by a High Court ruling that they should not be granted to local
authorities unless they were prepared to give cross-undertakings to the
court that if they eventually lost their case they would compensate the
stores for any financial losses resulting from enforced Sunday closure.
Council lawyers say because of the potential financial risks involved in
giving cross-undertakings this decision makes the Sunday trading laws
virtually unenforceable.
Last week, for example, Texas Homecare, the DIY chain run by the Ladbroke
Group, raised the pressure on six local authorities by stating that they
could face a potential claim for damages in excess of Pounds 150,000 per
year for each store where Texas had given cross-undertakings not to trade.
The DIY chain asked the authorities to confirm that such an amount had been
reserved in their budgets.
B&amp;Q will argue before the Law Lords that the Shops Act is incompatible with
Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome, which prevents quantitative restrictions
on imports between member states of the EC.
Retailers claim that the Sunday trading ban reduces their turnover and
results in fewer orders for goods from suppliers in other member states,
thereby indirectly restricting the level of imports into the UK from those
states.
The issue has already been referred once to the European Court. In November
1989 the Court ruled the Shops Act would not be compatible with Article 30
unless the Sunday trading ban had an objective regarded as justified in EC
law and the effect on trade caused by the measure did not exceed that
necessary to obtain that objective.
This left the UK courts with considerable discretion which has only
succeeded in increasing the confusion surrounding the Sunday trading laws.
Both the Home Office and the British Retailers' Association (BRA) have
launched separate initiatives to try to establish common ground between the
two sides.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Breakdown in trust seen at British
Rail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRICT financial constraints on British Rail's managers have led to a
breakdown in trust between them and local union officials, according to a
study. It says the constraints have prevented BR from replacing its
traditional style of industrial relations with improved consultation.
The study of attitudes among local representatives of the Aslef train
drivers' union found that most believed managers were more likely to breach
locally-negotiated agreements at the end of the 1980s than at the beginning
of that decade.
The survey of 181 union representatives on local departmental committees at
train depots found a decline in contact between union leaders and local BR
managers, partly because of new management structures. The committees set
working conditions such as rosters. The survey found little evidence that BR
was developing forms of consultation with individuals to replace this
weakening of traditional union mechanisms. Consultation was being 'squeezed
out' by pressures of time and financial constraints.
The RMT rail union is planning an industrial action ballot on what BR says
is a final pay offer of 7 per cent. Aslef and the TSSA white-collar union
are seeking arbitration on the offer through the Railway Staffs National
Tribunal.
The unpublished study by Mr Andrew Pendleton, an industrial-relations
lecturer at the University of Bradford, found a decline in the commitment to
'constitutionalism' which has marked industrial relations at BR.
BR was prevented from implementing a reform of its union consultation
structures in 1989 by a series of one-day strikes by rail unions. It has yet
to make fresh proposals for the devolving of pay bargaining to match its
corporate structure.
The study found that the proportion of union representatives who thought
managers could be relied on to observe agreements all or most of the time
had dropped from 81 per cent in 1980 to 54 per cent in the summer of 1989.
Mr Pendleton says the impression is less of 'an aggressive, confident
management decisively removing or ignoring those agreements that stand in
their way' than of managers reacting in an ad hoc manner to intense
budgetary pressures. 'The overriding impression is one of managers under
pressure, caught between the imperative of cost reduction and the
constitutionalism of their subordinates, seeking room for manoeuvre in
day-to-day depot management.'

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Most tenders from councils won by
their own workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities' in-house labour forces have overwhelmingly held their own
against the private sector under government compulsory competitive
tendering, according to an advisory body survey.
The survey shows that in-house workforces, known as direct-labour
organisations, in England and Wales have won 69.7 per cent of 2,558
contracts in the first four rounds of compulsory tendering. Contracts won
in-house represent 84.3 per cent of the total value of contracts on offer.
Councils have been obliged by law since 1989 to put out to tender refuse
collection, street and building cleaning, catering, vehicle maintenance and
ground maintenance. Most contracts are for five years and councils are
generally bound to accept the lowest tender.
The survey was conducted by the Local Government Management Board, the
national body which advises local authorities on training, pay and
conditions, and management. It shows wide variations between different
services.
Refuse collection and ground maintenance face the greatest competition, with
an average of 3.4 tenders per contract. Only 10 per cent of
refuse-collection contracts were won without competition. Catering in
schools and social service departments drew an average of only 1.2 tenders
per contract, with 73 per cent of them won without competition.
There are marked regional variations, which correspond closely to councils'
political control. In-house labour has won all refuse-collection contracts
in Labour-dominated Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside and has been very
successful in the West Midlands.
In London only 58 per cent of contracts have gone in-house, and fewer than
two thirds have done so in the Tory-inclined south-east and East Anglia.
Contracts lost by councils' direct labour forces have almost all gone to the
private sector. There have been few management buy-outs.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Team talks deadlock at Royal Mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between management and unions on a new framework for industrial
relations at Royal Mail, the letters arm of the Post Office, have broken
down over proposals for team working.
This latest row comes after a decision by the Union of Communication
Workers, the main Post Office union, to ballot counter and clerical staff,
who work for the Post Office's Counters subsidiary, over a 6.8 per cent pay
offer. Mr Alan Tuffin, general sec-retary of the union, has described the
offer as 'inadequate'.
Royal Mail has wanted to introduce team working into its sorting and
delivery activities for some time but failed in its attempt to link the
issue to pay during last year's annual negotiations.
It became clear from a heated debate yesterday at the union's annual
conference in Blackpool that any renewed attempts to push through the
proposals as part of this year's pay talks in September could provoke
industrial action.
Agreement was reached with the UCW last year for a joint review, outside the
wage talks, of four issues. The issues are: productivity; automation; team
working; and a new framework for industrial relations to fit in with the
restructuring of the business.
It is planned to replace the 64 divisional districts early next year with
nine independent business centres.
Discussions on the new framework, as well as the team working proposals,
have run into trouble because of UCW objections to, in particular, the role
of team leaders.
The union has refused to accept that team leaders should have the power to
discipline team members. The UCW also fears that particular references to
team working in Royal Mail proposals for the new industrial relations
framework will undermine the shopfloor role of the union.
The management states in a document setting out the plan: 'Team members will
be able to express any concerns they may have either individually or jointly
to their team leader or team manager. In the first instance issues will
normally be discussed with the team leader, who will be responsible for . .
. identifying ideas and opportunities for further improvement.'
The Post Office said last night that the review was 'fundamental to future
working relations with the unions, and the direction we need to take to meet
changing customer needs'.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Small businesses still in recession,
says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S small businesses are still in the middle of a deep recession, with
output plunging more quickly than at any time in the last decade, according
to the Confederation of British Industry.
The CBI says that a fall in orders between January and the end of April
means that three-quarters of small businesses are now working below
capacity. Manufacturers were expecting a decline in output early in the
year, but the downturn was more severe than anticipated.
Most companies say they expect the rate of deterioration in business to
moderate during the next few months, echoing the CBI's most recent quarterly
trends survey.
Mr Tom O'Connor, chairman of the CBI's smaller firms council, said the
latest survey confirmed that business was 'bumping along the bottom', with
recovery some way off.
The report, based on a survey of nearly 750 companies with fewer than 200
employees and conducted in early April, found that businesses were
experiencing difficulty in raising their prices.

FT  13 MAY 91 / London is top centre for foreign share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England has confirmed the London Stock Exchange as the biggest
foreign equity market in the world. Reforms introduced in most continental
European bourses - in the Netherlands, Germany, France and Switzerland -
have not yet threatened its dominant position.
The Bank's Quarterly Bulletin reports that London, third largest overall
last year with equity turnover totalling Pounds 305bn (sales only), now
accounts for more than two thirds of reported trading of equities outside
their country of origin.
'Overall,' it says, 'London has been successful in attracting trading of
foreign, particularly European, equities because of its historically open
capital market and its low costs compared with other exchanges.'
Accurate data on foreign equity trading in London became available only in
February 1990.
This followed the full introduction of Sequal, the London Stock Exchange's
trade reporting and confirmation system for stocks quoted on Seaq
International, the exchange's screen-based professional market for trading
foreign equities.
The data reveal that foreign equity trading (Pounds 150bn, sales only, in
1990) accounted for just under half of total turnover on the London Stock
Exchange last year. This compares with foreign business of Pounds 4.3bn for
Frankfurt and Pounds 2.5bn for Paris.
Figures for the New York Stock Exchange, the next biggest foreign equity
market, are not generally available, but in the first quarter of 1990 it was
estimated that foreign equity turnover was only 25 per cent of that in
London. Tokyo came third last year, a long way behind with Pounds 7.3bn.
Japanese stocks took the largest share of London's foreign equity turnover
in 1990, accounting for just over a quarter of the total. German shares were
also heavily traded, accounting for about 23 per cent. Other European shares
contributed most of the remainder.
The Bank concludes that trading costs are low in London and that London's
trading structure, with market makers taking positions between buyers and
sellers, provides superior liquidity for large wholesale trades.
'In the current liberal capital environment,' the Bank says, 'trading will
tend to move to where market conditions are favourable.'

FT  13 MAY 91 / Tories plan VAT rise says Smith: Increase in rate to 22 per
cent said to be on taxation 'hidden agenda'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR WENT on the offensive over tax and spending policy yesterday by
raising the spectre of a Tory 'hidden agenda' to increase value added tax
should the Conservatives be returned to office after a general election.
In an assault on the Tories' record, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor,
accused the government of 'sheer hypocrisy' in claiming to have lowered
taxation when the total tax burden, taking in National Insurance and VAT,
had risen from 34.75 per cent in 1978-79 to 37.75 per cent in 1990-91.
Defending the government's achievements, Mr David Mellor, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, once again asked how Labour would raise public
spending by Pounds 20bn without increasing taxes.
The new skirmishing over taxation came as all the parties were manoeuvring
for maximum advantage before Thursday's by-election in Monmouth, where the
Tories are defending a 9,000 majority.
In spite of the efforts of Tory leaders to stamp out speculation over a June
general election some Conservatives still believe a good result in the seat
might bolster the case for an early poll.
Prior to a week-long programme of speeches to businessmen in Manchester,
Leeds and Birmingham, Mr Smith raised the VAT issue in his address to the
Banking, Insurance and Finance Union in Blackpool.
He warned that if Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, were to fulfil his
promise to lower basic tax rates to 20p in the pound he would either have to
cut public spending or shift the burden to another tax, probably VAT.
Labour has calculated that to fund a 5p cut in basic rate income tax the
Tories would have to increase VAT from 17.5 per cent to 22 per cent.
Officials pointed out that the Tories had shifted the tax burden to indirect
taxation when Sir Geoffrey Howe raised VAT from 8 per cent to 15 per cent,
shortly after denying any such plans at the preceding election.
Mr Mellor said in a BBC interview that there was no conflict between
lowering taxes and increasing public expenditure. 'The record shows we have
been able to strike a balance', he said, adding that Labour had yet to show
how it would 'outbid' the government on spending without tax increases.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Downing Street quiet on what Sir Robin Butler saw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE tight-lipped world of Downing Street news management was itself under
close scrutiny yesterday when it emerged that Sir Bernard Ingham, for 11
years Mrs Margaret Thatcher's press overlord, had found himself victim of
the censor's blue pencil.
Infamous for his non-attributable quotability, Sir Bernard's autobiography
has undergone some selective and, most probably, financially damaging
editing by the sensation-shy Cabinet Office. The memoirs, entitled Kill the
Messenger, have been long-awaited for revelations on the more controversial
moments of the Thatcher years.
Not least, pundits were anxious to read an account of the Westland
helicopter affair in 1985-86 which led to the resignation of Mr Michael
Heseltine as defence secretary.
Under the so-called Radcliffe rules, however, civil servants and ministers
must submit their drafts to the Cabinet Office.
The Sunday Times, ru-moured to have paid a six-figure sum for the serial
rights, yesterday had to make the best of having Sir Robin Butler, Britain's
chief home civil servant, as its unpaid editor. While carrying an officially
abridged version it tried to make good the damage with a front page report
of what Sir Robin saw.
Deletions included passages criticising Mr Heseltine's judgment and others
on Mrs Thatcher's often stormy dealings with European partners and Sir
Geoffrey Howe, her deputy prime minister.
On the key question of whether Downing Street or the Department of Trade and
Industry leaked the memorandum from the then solicitor general which was
critical of Mr Heseltine, Sir Bernard was allowed to go on the record with
his plea of innocence.
Downing Street yesterday was characteristically taciturn about whether The
Sunday Times would be hauled over the coals for its revelations - as, it
pointed out, it was unclear whether or not they were revelations.
Its classic reply: 'We don't answer hypothetical questions,' was a
well-known formula of Sir Bernard's, who was yesterday understood to be
unavailable for comment.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Fabian call for overhaul of regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SYSTEM for regulating utilities should be radically overhauled, with
commissions introduced to hold open hearings on the utilities' plans,
according to a Fabian Society paper published today.
The society, a left-of-centre think tank, argues that US-style regulatory
commissions should be created to oversee the water, gas and electricity
industries.
At the open hearings consumers and other interested parties could give
evidence. The commissions would be much more open than the current
regulatory offices Ofwat, Ofgas and Offer.
The study, by Professor Michael Waterson of Reading University, argues that
commissions holding open hearings would be more appropriate for water, gas
and electricity because there are limited prospects for introducing
competition there.
He argues that forms of regulation should be tailored to the characteristics
of the industries concerned, however. So in industries such as
telecommunications, where technological change is opening opportunities for
competition, the current body, Oftel, is perfectly adequate.
Prof Waterson acknowledges that public commissions can be much more
expensive than regulatory offices. He says the latter system might be
usefully extended to organisations such as the Post Office and British Rail,
which are becoming more commercial.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Japanese to open machine tool plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW Japanese assault on an important sector of the European machinery
market is officially launched tomorrow from the unlikely venue of a
refurbished factory in Salisbury.
Within sight of the cathedral spire, Kitagawa, the world's largest producer
of power chucks for machine tools, has joined forces with Mr Tertius
Threipland, a British entrepreneur, to begin manufacturing chucks in Europe
for the first time.
The move could increase the competitive pressures on the five big European
producers, of which the 600 Group's Pratt Burnerd is the best known in the
UK. Many producers have been hit badly by recession.
Mr Threipland is chairman and managing director of Kitagawa Europe, a
partnership with the Japanese parent company, which for 10 years has been
distributing Kitagawa products into European markets.
The partners are switching to manufacturing in Europe because of long-term
growth prospects and, said Mr Threipland, because the 1992 single market
reforms might make it difficult to import chucks from Japan.
He said: 'We hope we will now be more acceptable in Germany, which has been
the most nationalistic about machinery and accessories, particularly on
conspicuous products like chucks.'
Mr Threipland, who for years has wanted to own a UK chuck manufacturer,
admitted: 'We had to fight quite hard to convince the Japanese to choose the
UK rather than Belgium and Germany.'
The UK was chosen because of labour costs, availability of technology and
skills, and the fact that the European sales headquarters was already in
Salisbury.
The factory is one of the few opened recently in Europe in the machine tool
sector. In spite of the recession in the UK, Mr Threipland hopes it will be
running at two-thirds capacity by early autumn, producing 200 chucks a month
 -of which 70 per cent will be for export.
The factory now employs six people, but as the product range is expanded in
the next five years the workforce should reach 40 to 45. The total
investment is expected to reach Pounds 5m by then.
Japanese companies rarely enter manufacturing joint ventures with individual
entrepreneurs overseas, although associations are more common between the
big Japanese trading houses and foreigners.
There will be no Japanese-style company anthems, but Mr Threipland did have
the builders and decorators working at Japanese speeds over Christmas to get
the factory ready. It was completed on New Year's Day.

FT  13 MAY 91 / S Africa squatter camp attack claims 27 lives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST 27 people were killed yesterday in an attack on a squatter camp
near Johannesburg, despite last week's outline agreement between the African
National Congress (ANC) and the South African government on steps to end
violence in the townships.
Squatters said their attackers, Zulu inhabitants of the local hostel in the
township of Kagiso, were armed with spears and other sharp instruments.
At the insistence of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, spears were omitted
from a list of weapons banned last week by the South African authorities.
The ANC is demanding that the carrying of spears be illegal, and has said it
will pull out of talks on the country's political future unless this demand
is met.
The ANC has given the government until Thursday to comply with this demand,
while its national executive will meet later today to consider the rest of
the outline agreement reached last week with Pretoria.
This involved the banning of all so-called 'traditional weapons' apart from
spears and sticks, the phasing-out of single-sex hostels and the prohibition
of the use of live ammunition by police for crowd control.
That agreement was reached between Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy
president, and Mr FW de Klerk, the president, assisted by a handful of
advisers.
ANC officials stress that it could still be rejected by the organisation's
national executive, triggering an earlier threat by the ANC to withdraw from
talks.
Mr Mandela said in an interview published in the Johannesburg Sunday Times
that he was 'optimistic that we would be able to save the peace process'.
However, he stressed that they would pull out of talks unless the government
met every demand in its recent seven-point ultimatum, which included the
issues addressed in last week's talks.
Meanwhile, South African police opened fire early on Saturday morning on a
group of right-wing whites who attacked a squatter camp in the western
Transvaal.
It was the first time in decades that police had fired on whites, and two
white farmers were injured.
The whites had attacked a group of blacks who had re-occupied land from
which they were forcibly removed 13 years ago.
Judgment is expected later today in the trial of Mrs Winnie Mandela, on
charges of kidnapping and assault with intent to commit grievous bodily
harm.
Mr Justice Michael Stegmann, the presiding judge, is expected to deliver his
verdict by Wednesday.

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Economic Indicators: How to compare relative
economic wealth - National accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST CONVENIENT way to compare the economic size and wealth of countries
is to convert figures for gross national product into a common currency
using market exchange rates. But the results can be misleading.
The dangers are illustrated in this week's table, in which data on the gross
national product or gross domestic product of each country have been
converted into a common currency, the European currency unit (Ecu).
Some surprising things emerge. For example, Japanese GNP apparently
contracted last year, to Ecu2,332.4bn from Ecu2,625.2bn in 1989, so reducing
Japan's share in the total output of the six largest industrialised
countries to 22.5 per cent in 1990, from 24.2 per cent in 1989. Yet Japan's
economic growth rate was the highest of the six countries, as the lower half
of the table shows.
This apparent contradiction is explained by the yen's 21 per cent
depreciation against the Ecu between 1989 and 1990. Large fluctuations in
exchange rates can give a misleading picture of changes in economic
fortunes.
What matters in comparing economic size is the relative purchasing power
these figures represent: the quantity of goods that nominal GNP will buy in
each country.
The OECD has calculated the levels of income needed in each national
currency to purchase an identical basket of goods and services at prevailing
domestic prices. In 1990 a specific basket of goods costing dollars 100 to
buy in the US would have cost Y19,800 in Japan and pounds 63.40 in the UK.
Converting each country's GNP into dollars using these purchasing power
parity (PPP) exchange rates provides a better guide to economic size, one
that adjusts for fluctuations in exchange rates. The Japanese share in total
PPP-adjusted GNP did rise from 18.6 per cent in 1989 to 19.3 per cent in
1990, as one would expect.
The adjustment for PPP produces a very different picture of relative
economic size in 1990. Both the US and the UK have a higher share of the six
countries' total output on the basis of the PPP measure than on the basis of
current exchange rates, and vice versa for the other four.
The graph shows levels of average GNP per head in 1990, converted into
dollars. At current exchange rates (on the vertical axis) Germany had the
highest income per head, followed by Japan and the US. Using PPP exchange
rates, however, (on the horizontal axis) this order is reversed.
At current exchange rates the relative size and income per head of the
German and Japanese economies is over-stated, relative to their purchasing
power equivalent - they both lie to the left of the 45 degree line.
This means that prices overall are higher in Japan than in the US at current
exchange rates. Why then do US companies not sell more goods in Japan, until
the price differences disappear? Perhaps transport costs, tariffs, or
restrictive practices prevent US companies from doing so or, alternatively,
Japanese consumers prefer Japanese goods.
A better explanation is that prices are higher for non-tradable goods
(services such as domestic banking and insurance, taxis and hair cuts) in
the continental European economies and Japan than in the US and UK, because
these economies are relatively more efficient at producing tradable (largely
manufactured) goods, and relatively less efficient at producing non-tradable
goods. Thus, these four countries have higher real exchange rates (defined
as the relative price of non-tradable goods in terms of tradable goods).
The prices of tradable goods are brought into rough equality by global
competition (ignoring the impact of trade barriers). Consequently these
countries will have relatively high domestic prices for non-tradable goods
at market exchange rates. This will boost the value of their output at
current exchange rates.
If developing countries were to be included in the chart they would all lie
below the 45 degree line. This is because they are relatively less
productive than developed countries at producing tradable goods than they
are at producing non-tradable goods. Thus dollars 1 buys far more services
in, say, Indonesia than in the US at current exchange rates.

Payments (April 15), Money and Finance (April 22), Production and Employment
(April 29) and Prices and Competitiveness (May 7). Back issues can be

FT  13 MAY 91 / Israel mars superpower tete-a-tete: Baker and Bessmertnykh
seek to 'kick start' Mideast peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and HUGH CARNEGY

   CAIRO, JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, and his Soviet counterpart, Mr
Alexander Bessmertnykh, met over a 'working dinner' on the banks of the Nile
last night in an against-the-odds attempt to 'kick start' the Middle East
peace process.
The deepening dilemma facing the two men is how to persuade Israel to take
even the first tentative steps towards an historic compromise with the
Arabs, based on key UN resolutions 242 and 338 requiring Israeli withdrawal
from territories occupied in the 1967 war.
As they sat down for their repast the news from Israel could hardly have
been less promising. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli premier, again insisted
at the weekend that Israel would not withdraw from the occupied territories.
Mr Baker would also not have been encouraged by the negative Israeli
reaction to his announcement on Saturday that Gulf states led by Saudi
Arabia had agreed to send an observer to the proposed regional Middle East
peace conference. Mr Shamir's senior adviser dismissed the announcement as
unimportant.
He said such countries had to go much further, ending hostile relations and
the Arab economic boycott of Israel and taking a full part in any peace
negotiations. 'We don't need observers as far as the Arab states are
concerned, we need participants,' Mr Yossi Ben-Aharon, the director of the
prime ministry, said.
However, there was one small chink of light from Mr David Levy, the foreign
minister, who adopted a less strident tone, offering the Gulf Co-operation
Council (GCC) a cautious welcome and expressing hope that a peace process
could be started.
Mr Shamir also repeated a somewhat softened line on the key issue of the
settlements by saying they would eventually be a subject for negotiation,
but not at this stage.
This fits with the position Mr Shamir has consistently adopted when
confronting the demand that a peace conference be based on a 'land for
peace' formula. He says this would pre-ordain an outcome unacceptable to his
government. But he has left open the possibility that all such demands could
be negotiated at a second stage of a two-step peace process.
Mr Baker, whose fourth mission to the Middle East in two months has been
variously described as 'do-or-die' and 'make-or-break', is in danger of
seeing his efforts running into the sand unless he can produce a formula to
narrow what appear to be almost irreconcilable differences between the two
sides.
With Israel insisting that any regional gathering must be limited to a more
or less ceremonial introductory session hosted jointly by the US and the
Soviet Union, and the Arabs demanding UN involvement in a conference with
real powers, Mr Baker and Mr Bessmertnykh have their work cut out for them.
Perhaps the most promising development in the absence of any sign of real
progress is that for the first time in more than a generation Washington and
Moscow are actively co-operating in an attempt to break the Arab-Israeli
impasse.
The idea that the foreign ministers of the two superpowers would be dining
in Cairo in an effort to resolve one of the world's most intractable
problems would have been unthinkable until recently. Whether the fact that
it took place in the only Arab capital to have recognised Israel will budge
the hardline Israeli government is another matter.

A BRITISH company blacklisted by the US Treasury as a suspected agent of the
Iraqi government was yesterday cleared of suspicion and allowed to continue
trading with American corporations.
Sollatek, an electronics company based in London, is the fourth organisation
named by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control on April 1 to have
been issued with a licence pending its removal from the blacklist.
The action follows discussions with officials at the UK Department of Trade
and Industry. PMK, Qudos and Liverpool Polytechnic were granted similar
licences last week.
Mr Manhal Allos, director, said last night he had not ruled out legal action
against the US government.

<TEXT>
'SAVE DEMOCRACY, change society' says a slogan scrawled on a wall in
Kathmandu. It has been just a year since the people of Nepal marched through
the streets demanding multi-party elections and a new constitution to limit
the power of their monarch, King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev.
Yesterday, 11m of the Himalayan kingdom's 18m people went to the polls to
exercise their new rights.
Voters lined up hours before polling stations opened at 8am, with many then
waiting hours to vote. 'I am voting for the party that I like,' said a
77-year-old woman. Beaming with pride, she added: 'This is the first time I
have voted in my life.'
The two main parties in the race for parliamentary seats are the Congress
party and the Nepalese Communist party, former partners in the interim
coalition government which has ruled for a year.
In Kirtipur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, voters queued at the local Hindu
shrine doubling as a polling station. 'I am very, very happy to vote, even
if I have to wait in the queue for five hours,' said Surendra, 22, a
business student at the local college.
He said he voted for the Congress party, but he stood with arms linked
around his friend, Ram, 20, who says he voted for the Communists.
'This town will divide half for Congress, half for the Communists,' said
Ram, 'but it will not cause any problems. The elections decide only the
parliament and not our relationships. The government may not last, but
friendships will.'
More than 75,000 policemen and 100,000 soldiers were called out to guard
polling stations. Soldiers armed with submachine-guns patrolled the streets
in armoured vehicles, despite a promise from the government to deploy troops
only in the event of violence.
Shops in all of the big cities were closed for election day and the streets
of the capital were virtually empty, in stark contrast to the frenzied days
of campaigning that led up to the election.
For weeks Nepal has been besieged by party vehicles, blaring slogans and
playing Nepalese folk music 24 hours a day. Walls, buses, trees, and houses
are covered with colourful drawings of the various party symbols - cows,
trees, suns, and fish  - as well as Nepali and English graffito asking for
voter support.
Mr Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, the prime minister and leader of the Congress
party, toured the country in an army helicopter for four days before
polling.
Throughout Nepal engineers set up computers, facsimile machines and
high-speed printers in preparation for voting. Mr Anders Koldby, a Danish
consultant whose government contributed Dollars 1m of computer equipment to
the Nepal Election Commission, said: 'Our biggest problem is that only 50
districts have telephones. In the other 25 districts, we are trying to run
fax machines by battery.'
The election commission now has 26 computers and 50 districts have fax
machines. Mr Neel Kantha Uprety, co-ordinator of the computer division of
the Election Commission, said the problem was to convince people they could
work with the equipment. 'Some are afraid to touch a computer. They see it
as a magic box. It's a whole new world for us.'

FT  13 MAY 91 / Poland to discuss arrears settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Euromarkets Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND HAS indicated it is willing to negotiate a settlement of its Dollars
1bn (Pounds 588m) interest arrears owed to commercial banks before starting
talks on a comprehensive agreement over its medium- and long-term bank debt.
The move, at a meeting with leading bankers in Frankfurt last week, marks a
significant shift in the Polish government's negotiating position. It was
previously unwilling to negotiate over arrears except as part of a
comprehensive debt agreement.
The government, which has not paid any interest on its bank debt since the
start of last year, also offered last week a Dollars 100m interest payment
and said it would deposit 20 per cent of interest going forward into a
special account at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle.
Banks are holding out for more, but the offer has opened the way for
progress to a comprehensive debt agreement, including debt-cut options where
loans will be exchanged for concessional bonds, bankers say. More talks with
Poland's bank creditor group are expected this month.
Poland's bank debt comprises about Dollars 10bn of its total Dollars 45bn
foreign debt. The US and other nations have pressed the banks to match a
debt write-off of at least 50 per cent granted by official creditors of the
Paris Club. But many banks resist such a large write-off.

<TEXT>
THE Serbian minority living in Croatia's region of Krajina voted yesterday
in a referendum on whether they wanted to unite with Serbia and stay within
a federal Yugoslavia.
An early count indicated that most people voted in favour of joining Serbia.
It was the first of five plebiscites to be held this month across the
country and a 'yes' vote will add to tensions between the minority Serbs and
the Croatian authorities.
Croatia, along with the other western republic, Slovenia, has already taken
steps towards secession and insists that the present federation of six
republics be transformed into a loose organisation of independent states.
Serbian leaders in Krajina said they would fight attempts by Croatia to
impose 'outside rule' over their territory, which they have proclaimed
autonomous. This is despite an accord reached last Thursday by the
collective presidency to try to halt clashes between Serbs and Croats which
have brought the country to the brink of civil war. Croatian authorities
declared the referendum illegal.

MR STANISLAW Tyminski, the main populist challenger to Poland's ruling
Solidarity establishment, was formally voted in yesterday as leader of his
new 'X' party at a congress in Warsaw.
The Polish-Canadian businessman has been barred from running for parliament
in elections expected this autumn, following a new electoral law requiring
five years' residence to become a deputy. The electoral law, approved by the
Sejm, the parliament's lower chamber, on Friday, has yet to be passed by the
upper house.
It adopts a proportional system for the Sejm favouring smaller parties. The
Senate will be elected on a first-past-the-post system. The 'X' party's
delegates, representing some 5,000 members, met behind closed doors with
officials promising details of its programme later in the week.

Greece's current account deficit fell 13.6 per cent to Dollars 1.69bn
(Pounds 1bn) in the first quarter, reflecting a sharp rise in invisible
receipts and better export performance, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
But the visible trade gap widened by 14.3 per cent to Dollars 3.45bn, mainly
because of higher prices for imported fuel, the Bank of Greece says. It is
the first time in over two years that the current-account deficit has shown
a quarterly improvement.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Supreme Soviet to allow sacking of workers for indiscipline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Supreme Soviet has also amended labour legislation to permit managements
to fire workers who are guilty of indiscipline without the agreement of the
trade unions. The agreement is a compromise, following a veto by President
Mikhail Gorbachev of an earlier Supreme Soviet decision to allow managements
to fire workers freely. The new decision lays down that unions must be
consulted, and that their veto will remain where the labour code has not
been breached - as over redundancies. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
Russian Federation leader Boris Yeltsin yesterday met heads of 14 of
Russia's 16 autonomous republics to try to further unify the nation, news
reports said. The two have put aside their bitter political rivalry in
recent days. The republics represent about 20m of the 147m people in the
huge Russian republic.
At the meeting, it was decided that the autonomous republics would sign the
Union Treaty as equal subjects, the Interfax news agency reported. The
Treaty is Mr Gorbachev's plan to redefine the relationship between the
central government and the republics.

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Soviet Parliament yesterday approved an experiment for 'contract', or
volunteer sailors, in a move which is seen as the first tentative step to
transforming the vast Soviet armed services from a conscript to a
professional force.
The Supreme Soviet also approved a cut in naval service from three to two
years, bringing it into line with the army.
Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, the Supreme Soviet Speaker, said after the result had
been declared that 'a professional army is born'. Colonel General Grigory
Krivosheyev, deputy chief of staff of the armed forces, told the deputies
the experiment, to run from 1991 to 1994, would provide vital information on
the possibility of creating a professional army.
The experiment will run in four 'large naval units' - possibly the four main
Soviet fleets. Under it, seamen and petty officers will all serve an initial
six months - after which those wishing to volunteer will serve a further two
and a half years, while those wishing to remain as conscripts will serve a
further 18 months.
The pay of the volunteers is likely to be much higher than the conscripts -
ranging from Rbs250 to Rbs400 a month, compared to wages which are as low as
Rbs10 a month. Soviet forces are estimated at around 5m strong, with the
navy accounting for only about 500,000 of these.
The army has so far strongly opposed a move towards a professional service,
arguing that it is an indispensable medium of bringing together the diverse
nationalities of the Soviet Union, and that it would be too expensive. The
Interior Ministry Troops, or MVD, whose numbers have been swollen over the
past year as their services were increasingly required to cope with internal
strife, are also to discuss introducing professional status.

FT  13 MAY 91 / US team to advise on Soviet food distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US will send a team of agriculture experts to Moscow this week to help
solve the Soviet Union's food distribution problems.
President George Bush's offer to provide advice on a distribution system
follows a 45-minute telephone conversation between him and President Mikhail
Gorbachev at the weekend. It comes as the US administration considers a
Soviet request for a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 880m) agricultural export credit.
White House officials have said that, while Mr Bush is sympathetic to easing
any shortage of food on humanitarian grounds, he is worried by the lack of
movement towards a market economy.
A senior US national security adviser said last week that Mr Bush believed
that what the Soviets needed most was technical assistance. 'There is almost
certainly enough food in the Soviet Union. What's happening is it's not
getting to the markets, partly because of transportation, partly because
prices are so low that people are holding off the market, thinking that
prices are going to go up.'
The mission of farm experts could thus be a prelude to approval of some form
of credits, which are backed by legislators from farming states. Senator
Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader from the grain state of Kansas,
said yesterday that the Senate should take up the export credit guarantee
issue this week as long as there was provision for certain individual Soviet
republics to participate.
The experts' team will be lead by Mr Richard Crowder, under-secretary of
agriculture, and will include Mr Ed Hewett, the leading Soviet specialist on
the national security council staff.
Mr Bush and Mr Gorbachev also discussed remaining arms control issues,
notably the proposed agreement on reducing strategic arms and remaining
problems over implementation of the treaty to reduce conventional forces in
Europe, according to the White House.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHEL Camdessus, IMF chairman, yesterday pledged support for Egypt's
efforts to persuade foreign creditors to forgive a large part of its Dollars
35bn (Pounds 20.7bn) foreign debt.
Mr Camdessus told President Hosni Mubarak the fund would back Egypt's
application for debt forgiveness at a meeting of the Paris Club of creditor
nations this month. He was speaking on the eve of this week's signing in
Washington of a new Dollars 400m standby agreement, under which Egypt has
pledged to press ahead faster with liberalising its economy.
'Your country has a convincing programme. I think it will get strong support
from the international community,' Mr Camdessus is reported to have said. Mr
Mubarak leaves later this week to visit France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg
and Turkey, in efforts to secure debt forgiveness under terms like those
accorded to Poland recently.
The Paris Club last month agreed to cut Warsaw's Dollars 35bn official debt
by 30 per cent over the next three years and by 20 per cent more if Poland
stuck to an agreed economic reform programme. Egypt recently raised energy
prices and import tariffs in a drive to cut its budget deficit, a key IMF
demand.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Chancellor faces growing pressure to cut base rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT faces a tough decision this week on whether to bow to
growing pressure for a cut in UK interest rates or to hold out for further
evidence of a decline in inflation.
The signs at the weekend were that the chancellor may hold off from easing
borrowing conditions over the next few days, partly to signal his
unhappiness about the high level of underlying inflation, particularly as
measured by wage increases.
However, the government will face a barrage of calls from industry and
political opponents to cut base rates, now at 12 per cent, in the light of
fresh evidence about the depth of the recession.
Concern about the most serious economic decline for 10 years promises to be
a factor in the voting in Thursday's by-election in Monmouth.
Government figures due on Thursday are expected to show that unemployment
rose last month by about 85,000, following the record increase of 113,000 in
March.
The latest data on bank lending, due today, are likely to illustrate the low
level of demand in the economy, in spite of the recent sequence of rate cuts
which have brought base rates down from 14 per cent in mid-February.
Speculation has mounted that Mr Lamont will use the opportunity of a large
fall in the retail price index, due to be announced on Friday, to sanction a
further  1/2 percentage point cut. The annual rate of increase in the RPI,
8.2 per cent in March, is likely to have come down by about 2 percentage
points last month - largely due to technical factors resulting from the
community charge and changes in mortgage rates.
Underlying inflation - the RPI less the effects of the poll tax and interest
rates - appears to be coming down less quickly. Moreover, the latest figures
for the rate of increase in average earnings, to be announced on Thursday,
are expected to show this figure was stuck at more than 9 per cent in March,
the same as in February.
UK monetary officials are concerned that companies may be trying to pass on
to consumers, in the form of higher prices, too great a proportion of their
own cost increases due to wage rises.
Last week Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, issued
a veiled warning against the idea of cutting rates too quickly.
One theory is that policymakers may deliberately pass on the chance of
cutting rates on Friday - if only to keep financial markets from linking
announcements about falls in the RPI to an automatic easing in monetary
conditions.

US officials were last night gloomy about progress towards a Middle East
peace conference after six hours of inconclusive talks between Mr James
Baker, secretary of state, and Syria's President Hafez al-Assad.
A senior official said there had been 'no particular progress' on critical
issues such as Arab insistence, against Israeli objections, on United
Nations involvement in a proposed peace gathering.
Mr Baker, who is on his fourth visit to the region since the end of the Gulf
war in March, left Damascus for Cairo where he held a 'working dinner' last
night with Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, the Soviet foreign minister. Mr Baker
is due to visit Jordan and Israel in the next few days.
Washington and Moscow are collaborating in efforts to organise a regional
peace conference, but these are in danger of collapsing because of wide
differences between Israel and the Arabs, especially Syria.
Mr Baker tried unsuccessfully yesterday to persuade Mr Assad to show greater
flexibility on the details of the proposed Middle East conference.
Mr Assad wants the full application of UN resolutions requiring Israeli
withdrawal from occupied Arab land, including Syria's Golan Heights,
captured in the 1967 war and subsequently annexed.
A spokesman for Mr Assad, seeking to put the best face on unpromising
discussions with Mr Baker, said that 'President Assad reiterated Syria's
real desire to establish a just and comprehensive peace in accordance with
UN resolutions . . . He also affirmed the continuation of Syria's readiness
to co-operate with current efforts to achieve the best formula that would
push forward the peace process.'
Mr Baker, in concert with Mr Bessmertnykh, is trying to increase the
pressure on Israel and the Arabs to bury their differences, but he is
battling against a long legacy of bitterness and distrust.
US officials in Cairo were pessimistic about chances of Israeli
co-operation. will know exactly what separates the parties and then we will
determine what the next steps are,' one official said.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's premier, re-stated his determination at the
weekend never to yield territory seized in 1967. 'We will not give up, not
only Jerusalem, but any portion of the land of Israel,' Mr Shamir said in a
speech.
Mr Baker received what amounted to a glimmer of good news on the eve of his
latest Middle East shuttle when the Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia
announced they would send an observer to a proposed peace conference.
The six Gulf Co-operation Council states also said they would participate in
discussions with Israel on such issues as disarmament, water conservation
and the environment.
US officials described these undertakings as something of a 'breakthrough',
since the Gulf states had never before signalled a willingness to sit down
at the same negotiating table as Israel; but in a statement that is certain
to displease the Americans, a senior Israeli yesterday described the GCC
announcement as unimportant.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK softens stance on EC social charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT can now support most elements of the European Social Charter,
although remaining opposed to some of the proposals, according to Mr Michael
Howard, the employment secretary.
His remarks, in an interview with the Financial Times, suggest that much of
the hostility towards the charter expressed by the British government under
Mrs Margaret Thatcher has disappeared.
Mr Howard said he had been 'very encouraged' by the recent approach of Ms
Vasso Papandreou, European social affairs commissioner, and by changes in
the form and content of legislative proposals.
His comments represent the most conciliatory note struck so far between the
British government and the European Commission over the social charter. The
government originally criticised it on the grounds that it would damage
business. They follow attempts by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to
improve relations with the European Community. Mr Howard said he believed
Britain would now be opposed to only a dozen of the 50 proposals expected in
the 'social action programme'.
The minister has said until now that a third of the social action proposals
would be acceptable, a third would have to be negotiated and a third would
be unacceptable. He said changes in the past six months had led to a
significant shift in these proportions.
'There are many measures which we fully support, indeed the majority of
measures coming out under the social action programme. There are some we
shall continue to resist,' said Mr Howard last week.
The government had managed to negotiate changes in the form of some
proposals, he said. It had also been encouraged because some of the
proposals which it thought were going to appear as being directives have
become non-binding recommendations. He said he had been encouraged when Ms
Papandreou accepted his suggestions earlier this year that draft proposals
should be shown to member states before being published, and that each
government should help evaluate the costs to business.
Among the proposals which have proved less difficult than the British
government feared is the directive on written employment contracts first
published in November. However, directives on working time and employee
consultation remain controversial.
Separately, Mr Howard said he was keeping under review the rule that the
employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils should be headed only by
chairmen and chief executives of private-sector companies, and in no case by
personnel directors.
He said a future trade union act following a general election would probably
contain proposals to tighten the regulation of union financing in view of
anomalies shown by the handling of National Union of Mineworkers' finances.
Mr Howard also reiterated that the 26 wages councils setting minimum wages
for 2.5m workers had 'no permanent place' and would eventually be abolished
by the government.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Hard Ecu plan to be reviewed: UK may back down after
concession on single currency timing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN MAY back down on its hard Ecu plan following an important concession
on the timing of a single currency proposed at a meeting of EC finance
ministers.
The hard Ecu is a central plank in the British government's ideas for
European economic and monetary union but the idea has gained few supporters
in the rest of Europe.
The proposal will be reviewed by senior UK officials in the next few weeks
with the option of dropping it as a goodwill gesture to Britain's partners.
Such a turnabout could raise political difficulties because the Conservative
government has long insisted that its hard Ecu alternative has been
generating interest abroad in spite of Labour scepticism.
According to the concession proposed at the weekend meeting in Luxembourg by
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, Britain could sign
a treaty on Emu later this year without agreeing on the final goal, to which
the UK attaches strong reservations, of a single European currency and a new
European central bank.
That would mean Britain could join the other EC nations in stage two of Emu
but leave open the question of further involvement until the late 1990s.
According to some countries' schedule, the third and final phase of Emu
would begin around 2000, and usher in the full operation of a new, single
currency and the new central bank.
The general feeling from the meeting, said Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian
finance minister, was that 'no country should be allowed to stop others
advancing to Emu and that no country could have a single currency imposed on
it'.
The proposal was supported by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition
commissioner. 'It could be made clear that the UK was formally reserving its
position, not just on when, but on whether, it accepts a single currency,'
Sir Leon said.
The British government reacted cautiously to Mr Delors' proposal. Mr Norman
Lamont, the UK chancellor, said the suggestion was 'constructive but not a
dramatic breakthrough'. There were still 'a million questions', many of them
posed by other countries, that had yet to be answered about Emu.
Downing Street also made clear that the option was just one of many coming
out of the negotiations.
Tory MPs appeared divided on the issue although, at first sight, the Delors
plan may appeal to the leadership on the grounds that it should largely
remove the controversy within the party on the Emu issue in the run up to a
general election that most now believe will come in the autumn.
However, there is also considerable concern that acceptance of the
compromise might be seen as tacit endorsement of a 'two-speed' Europe -
something the government has always vigorously opposed.
The hard Ecu, proposed two years ago with Mrs Margaret Thatcher's support,
was designed partly to keep Britain in the mainstream of the Emu debate.
The proposal is for a new currency with anti-inflationary characteristics,
which would be used by European businesses alongside existing national
currencies. It would be separate from the existing basket Ecu - the notional
currency which the European Commission hopes will evolve ultimately into a
new single financial unit for Europe.
The hard Ecu strategy is to be discussed by the main Whitehall committee
responsible for the approach to Emu. The committee is chaired by Mr Nigel
Wickes, a second permanent secretary at the Treasury, and includes
representatives from the Foreign Office, the Bank of England and the prime
minister's policy unit.
In the light of the less than wholehearted support received from the rest of
Europe, the hard Ecu could be abandoned, although Britain would probably
continue to press for some of the basic tenets behind the proposal, such as
the need to fight inflation.
Apart from the main discussions, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance
minister, sought to smooth over differences with the Germany on the timing
of the formation of the European Central Bank.
His officials spoke only of an institutition 'pre-figuring' the bank being
set up in 1994. However, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister,
remained insistent that it should be formed only on the eve of a single
currency.

decision, while at the same time allowing the Emu process to go ahead'.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Trade blocs are here to stay: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's gross national product is less than 4 per cent of America's. Its
exports account for only one third of one per cent of US domestic
consumption. So why does the prospect of a free trade agreement with Mexico
excite so much more interest in Washington than the Uruguay Round trade
talks - which affect US trade with the whole world, including economic
powers such as Japan and Germany?
The answer lies partly in American indifference to the wider world. Mexico
has a long border with the US; the hope that free trade will encourage it to
export goods rather than people is taken seriously. Mention the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), however, and you invite the blankest
of stares. The man on Main Street probably could not identify Geneva on a
map, still less comprehend why a bunch of European bureaucrats should exert
influence over US trade policy. Never forget that international bodies count
for little here: after 40 years, some congressmen still believe the World
Bank is an aid agency based in New York. Gatt is obscurity squared.
The deeper answer is that bilateral pacts, such as the planned agreement
with Mexico, are more acceptable to the aggressive American psyche that the
abstract logic of multilateral trade liberalisation. Support for free trade
in the US has a short history. In the late 19th century when Britain was
trumpeting the virtues of trade liberalisation (and gradually sinking below
the waves as an economic power) the US was busy creating an industrial
powerhouse - behind high tariff walls. The US conversion came in the
aftermath of the second world war, when Europe and Japan were weak and no
threat to the US market.
With the loss of economic hegemony, analysts are again questioning the
merits of traditional free trade. US fears are encapsulated in a recent
essay* by Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former senior official at the commerce
department who heads the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington
think-tank. Mr Prestowitz invents the term 'Gattism' to describe 'a belief,
bordering on religious faith, in the power of ever more detailed trade rules
to solve major domestic and international trade problems'. He dismisses the
Uruguay Round as a 'futile, legalistic crusade to homogenise different
nations'.
The Gatt is based on two fundamental principles: 'national treatment' and
'most-favoured nation'. Under national treatment, members agree to treat
foreign companies exactly as they treat domestic companies. Under
most-favoured nation, liberal rules agreed between any two Gatt signatories
must be extended to all others. Mr Prestowitz (and many others) regard both
principles as unjust. This is because they do not require comparable rules
to be applied in all member countries. A restrictive country can impose all
kinds of barriers (provided it does not discriminate against foreign
companies) while its exporters piggy-back on the liberal laws agreed
elsewhere.
'Gattism' reflects a belief that unilateral trade disarmament is beneficial.
(Like Christians turning the other cheek, free market purists welcome
dumping and other infractions because they initially benefit the consumer.)
The economic case for unilateralism, however, is weaker than often
pretended. If you make the usual sweeping neo-classical assumptions - no
economies of scale, no unemployment (because prices clear all markets) and
no uncertainty about the future - you can show that a small country should
eschew protection.
But even in this fairy tale world, neo-classical theory indicates that a
large country such as the US can benefit by imposing an 'optimal' tariff: at
a certain level of protection, the gain from the improvement in its terms of
trade more than offsets the loss of imports. Game theory suggests this
remains true even if other countries retaliate.
Free market purists are thus being dogmatic when they claim to have 'proved'
that unilateral trade liberalisation is beneficial. It need not be even in
their idealised world. Nor is the empirical evidence compelling: the huge
success of Japan and South Korea suggests that, for individual countries, a
combination of export promotion and import restriction can be more
profitable than unilateral trade disarmament. But it is not an option for
the world as a whole. The question, therefore, is how to persuade countries
to pursue policies that may not always be in their own interests but which
benefit everybody in the long run.
One popular option is to lay greater stress on reciprocity - a principle
that horrifies purists. 'I will open my markets if you will open yours' is
an offer that politicians and businessmen find difficult to reject. Unlike
strict 'Gattism', it seems self-evidently fair. Yet it is most easily
pursued through bilateral agreements in which like-minded countries can
directly trade concessions.
Seen through US eyes, mercantilist Japan is dominating Asia through a
network of direct foreign investment links. European Community nations,
while outwardly in favour of multilateral trade liberalisation, are
consolidating the advantages of preferential trading links through the
Single Market programme. In the circumstances, who can blame the US for
trying to forge its own regional trade bloc? Whatever happens to the Uruguay
Round, pacts with Canada and Mexico mark only the beginning of a more
assertive - and more selfish  - US trade policy.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Justinian: The admissibility of evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER, QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two former City merchant bankers who are awaiting trial on charges
arising out of the Guiness affair failed in the Court of Appeal (Criminal
Division) to have the testimony they both gave to Department of Trade
appointed inspectors declared inadmissible at their forthcoming trial.
Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell and
Lord Spens, former director of corporate finance at Henry Ansbacher, may
have a legitimate grievance that the law does not cover the questioning of
those involved in inspectors' investigations under the Companies Act.
Answers given by any person to inspectors are admissible in guidance in
subsequent proceedings. But are the answers safeguarded in the way that
police questioning is?
The legal issue is simple enough. Are DTI inspectors within the meaning of
the phrase in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, namely 'persons
charged with the duty of investigating offences?' If they are, they would be
bound to caution witnesses who appeared before them. Even if the inspectors
were investigating criminal offences, and there had been a breach of the
code established under the 1984 Act, it would still have been in order for
the trial judge to admit the evidence.
Mr Justice Henry, who will be trying the second Guiness case and who
conducted the pre-trial hearing, had decided that fairness to the accused
would not be threatened by allowing the evidence to be heard by the jury.
(Clearly, the prosecution attached great importance to the admissions made
by the two men to the inspectors.) The judge also rejected the claim that
improper means had been used to compel the two men to incriminate
themselves.
The Court of Appeal had little difficulty in concluding that inspectors do
not investigate offences of a criminal nature. They investigate events of a
commercial or financial nature, in the course of which they are very likely
to uncover criminality on the part of one or more of the actors in the
events under investigation.
The inspectors' task is quintessentially inquisitorial; and the task
partakes of none of the aspects of the criminal process which is designed to
protect the accused from any oppressive action by criminal investigator or
prosecutor. Inquisitions are by design held unremittingly to discover the
truth. The English criminal trial, on the other hand, is a restricted method
to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused according to a high
standard of proof. The trial process is the semblance of truth, or at least
may only approximate to the truth.
If the inspectors had nevertheless to caution a witness according to a
well-recognised formula before asking any questions, or advise that he or
she need not answer a question thought to incriminate the witness, it would
place an absurd restriction on the ability of the inspectors to uncover all
the relevant information.
Indeed, it may even be necessary for inspectors to withhold information from
a witness until the questioning takes place, or to confront a witness with a
highly material document for the first time during the questioning. Such
tactics would be regarded as highly irregular in a criminal trial.
Inspectors normally try to be fair to witnesses, but in the final analysis
their duty is to extract the optimum information and report their findings.
Mr Seelig and Lord Spens had asserted that there had been a conspiracy
between the inspectors, the DTI, the Serious Fraud Office and police
officers that the inspectors would use their statutory powers for an
ulterior purpose - namely, to build up a case for preferring criminal
charges and not for the purpose of investigating company affairs.
Two years ago such a danger was recognised by providing that where evidence
of a crime had been uncovered and referred to the prosecuting authority, the
minister could discontinue the inspectors' investigation. But those who have
to undergo the probing questions of inspectors will doubtless feel that the
exercise smacks of a preparation for criminal proceedings. Since criminal
charges, not infrequently, do follow these inspectors' reports, such
reaction of those investigated is not unreasonable. It all seems unfair.
Any unfairness in the procedure is publicly tolerable, indeed necessary in
the cause of finding the truth. What becomes less tolerable is the
publication of the inspectors' report - always held up pending any criminal
proceedings - because the individuals may be revealed for their commercial
irresponsibility, if not also for their criminality. Mr Robert Maxwell, the
publisher, smarted under the public condemnation of his behaviour as a
director over the affairs of Pergamon in the 1970s.
It is a common feature of public inquiries generally that prospective
witnesses are encouraged to come forward by promises that they will be given
immunity in respect of their testimony. The attorney-general then declares
that evidence before the inquiry will not be used in any subsequent criminal
proceedings.
Something akin to that concession would be appropriate for investigations by
DTI inspectors. There is even a case for treating the investigation, with
its draconian powers, and the public report that follows as a substitute for
a criminal trial, leaving it to stockholders or creditors to take
proceedings. But that would require an even more sophisticated approach to
the dubious value of criminal justice, as opposed to a searching public
inquiry and civil action, in unravelling complex financial dealings.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Money Markets: D-Mark stays weak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK traded among the weaker members of the European exchange rate
mechanism last week, despite its slight improvement against the dollar and
Japanese yen.
Currency trading was subdued, with the early part of the month lacking much
important economic news. There were no data on the UK or Japanese economies
and the only US figure of any significance was Friday's producer price index
for April.
Economic news from Germany was not encouraging, increasing the risk that
there will be a current account deficit in 1991, after last year's surplus
of DM75.5bn. The unified Germany has not yet managed a monthly surplus so
far this year. In March the current account shortfall was a substantial
DM5.3bn, compared with DM1.5bn in February.
A deficit of around DM3.5bn was expected, but payments for the Gulf war
increased the figure. A trade surplus of only DM2.8bn, against a forecast of
about DM3.5bn, was perhaps more worrying.
The size of the problem can be gauged by the fact that the old West Germany
had a current account surplus of DM12.2bn and a trade surplus of DM13.8bn in
March last year.
In the first three months of this year the German current account deficit
was DM8.9bn. Demand for goods in the east has sucked in imports and led to a
fall in exports, as West German industry has struggled to meet demand.
Imports rose 14 per cent to DM159.0bn in the first quarter, compared with a
year ago, while exports fell 6.6 per cent to DM165.8bn.
This state of affairs, coupled with rising inflation and political
instability in eastern Europe is not likely to improve the D-Mark's appeal,
particularly if the Bundesbank continues to resist the temptation to raise
interest rates.

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Dealers slow to appreciate benefits of
rechristening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Association of Inter-national Bond Dealers is to meet for the last time
later this week.
At its annual conference in Hong Kong, the regulatory body of the Eurobond
market will be reconstituted under a new name which better reflects its
broadening constituency.
The change marks a shift in direction as the AIBD leaves behind its roots as
a trade association and espouses broader issues.
However the move to re-christen the AIBD has met surprising resistance,
considering the disadvantages of a name which, in the minds of many market
participants, still stands for the Association of International Beer
Drinkers.
The proposal to change the name to the International Capital Market
Association met with disapproval from nostalgic traders unwilling to see the
organisation move away from its traditional base.
The AIBD's leadership, however, sees the need for the association, which has
already developed from a trade association to a regulatory bond, to evolve.
The similarity between the pronunciation of IPMA and ICMA prompted some
disquiet at the International Primary Market Association, the trade
association of the new issues market which broke away from the AIBD in the
mid-1980s. Some market participants feel there is no longer a separate role
for IPMA, and the two trade associations should band together.
In that case, issues such as the payment of lead management commissions
could be discussed and resolved in the context of a more powerful body.
However, a potential merger between the two groups still seems to be a long
way off, and political interests may forestall any such development.
There have been no discussions between the two bodies, even though many
members are in both, and might favour a streamlining.
The proposal to rename the organisation ICMA also met some objections from
foreign members who felt that 'capital' might be misunderstood.
Consequently, the proposed name has been changed to the International
Securities Market Association (ISMA), which was felt to be both sufficiently
broad and accurate.
'The name (AIBD) no longer truly represents our members, a lot of whom have
taken on several other functions (apart from dealing),' said Mr John
Langton, the AIBD's chief executive.
As well as the handful of statute changes (including the name issue) due to
be discussed at the meeting, a number of issues not on the official agenda
are likely to arise.
Under an amendment to the directive proposed by the French, Eurobond
transactions would have to be traded on regulated exchanges, and more
extensive price and volume reporting would be required.
Although all UK and some European firms report their trades to the AIBD, the
association would not be recognised as an exchange.
The AIBD has been actively lobbying the EC to prevent such a development,
but a stalemate appears to have been reached.
The argument advanced by the French, that off-exchange trading means
inadequate investor protection, is strongly rejected by the AIBD, which, as
a designated investment exchange under UK law, has been fighting to have its
statues and rule book recognised.
The AIBD is concerned that forcing all trades on to regulated exchanges will
limit cross border trading and reduce liquidity.
At the moment, something of an impasse appears to have been reached, with
the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, on one side, and the rest of
the community, led by France, on the other.
However, the AIBD is optimistic that it will succeed in persuading the EC to
accept its statutes and rules as fair and equitable. The next step would be
to try to obtain regulatory status, Mr Langton said.
The dispute over settlement procedures between the two European clearing
systems, Euroclear and Cedel, is also likely to resurface, even though most
market participants say they have 'learnt to live with it'.
Hopes have again been raised that agreement is near after an AIBD market
practices committee last week and a number of meetings between the three
parties (with the AIBD acting as a go-between).
'Euroclear has made a number of concessions and Cedel has respected those
and made some concessions too,' said Mr Langton, who added that there was
'an excellent chance' the problem would be resolved during this week's
meeting.
Last year, the two clearing systems agreed to renegotiate their 10-year-old
bridge agreement, widening the issue at stake from an original contention
about primary market settlement.
The bridge between the clearers is the mechanism by which settlement
information is exchanged and is generally agreed to have become outdated.
A memorandum of understanding was signed last September.
In October, Cedel put forward a proposal incorporating the need for multiple
exchange of files. Then in December, Euroclear put detailed proposals to
Cedel which included a commitment to incorporate multiple exchange of files,
seen as an important concession by Euroclear.
One issue which has never failed to spark complaints in the AIBD's 23-year
history is that of subscription rates.
Under a proposed statute change, the flat fee, currently SFr6,000, would be
substituted for a set range of SFr7,500 to SFr10,000.
The change is part of an attempt to improve the limitation of liability of
individual members to claims against the association by limiting liability
to the annual subscription rate. However fees have frequently been a
contentious issue, last leading to strong objections at the AIBD's Dallas
meeting in 1988, when members complained they were subsidising the
development of Trax, the AIBD's screen-based reporting system.
Because the AIBD has a strong UK membership, and is a self-regulatory body
under UK law, continental European members have often complained they were
financing UK members' compliance with UK regulations.
Now that Trax is running, and the commercial operations of the AIBD are
generating funds, there may be resistance to any increase in fees. But for
most leading firms, the costs involved are not significant.
The issue of cost has also arisen in the context of the meeting's location
in Hong Kong this year.
Some dealers said it made the conference too time-consuming and too
expensive.
Indeed, fears that a quorum might not be met have prompted proposals to
increase the number of proxies.
However, the choice of a more expensive location - along with some more
important issues - have helped encourage firms to send more senior
executives, while in previous years, junior traders without the authority to
make decisions were sometimes sent.
Discussions about any move towards live screen prices are unlikely to
advance.
Although this is felt to be a likely development in the longer term, the
daily feeds which the AIBD provides seem to be considered satisfactory.
The expense and the complexity of developing live screen prices in Eurobonds
are a deterrent, but such a shift also runs counter to some strong vested
interests within the Eurobond market.
Some banks feel their ability to trade profitably would be compromised by
too much transparency.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Syndicated Loans: Scandinavian deals dominate activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN borrowers dominated the syndicated loans market last week with
a flood of deals intended to refinance short-term debt and provide
medium-term financing.
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken - the largest commercial bank in Sweden, and
the bank affiliated to the Wallenberg family - last week launched a SKr9bn
acquisition finance facility for Patricia, the Wallenberg family's
fund-raising arm.
The facility will be used specifically to help finance the acquisition of
shares in Saab-Scania, the motor and aerospace group. Investor and
Providentia, the two Swedish investment companies controlled by the
Wallenberg family which jointly own Patricia, made a SKr12.8bn takeover bid
for outstanding shares in Saab-Scania in February.
SEB Capital Markets is agent and arranger for the facility, which is being
placed with a group of key relationship banks, both international and
domestic. These are thought to include J. P. Morgan, Citicorp, Manufacturers
Hanover, NatWest, Credit Lyonnais, Deutsche Bank and Swiss Bank Corporation
among others, although no commitments are in place yet.
The deal has an interesting structure because the loan will be available in
tranches of different maturities - namely nine months, two years and five
years. The pricing ranges from 85 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate (Libor) to over 100 basis points.
The facility will be guaranteed by Investor and Providentia and follows a
three-year, Dollars 1.1bn acquisition finance facility for Patricia arranged
by SEB earlier this year. Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit-rating
service, said last week that Patricia's A-1 commercial paper rating would be
upheld. The rating had been placed on CreditWatch in February following the
SKr12.8bn takeover bid for Saab-Scania.
Separately, SEB Capital Markets launched a Dollars 250m five-year facility
last week for Trelleborg, the Swedish mining and industrial conglomerate.
The facility consists of a Dollars 200m term loan and Dollars 50m revolving
credit facility.
Bankers consider the pricing - of 50 basis points over Libor for the first
three years, and 55 basis points over Libor thereafter - generous.
The Dollars 1.36bn syndicated loan arranged for Stora, the Swedish pulp and
paper group, by SEB Capital Markets was signed last week. The five-year
revolving credit and term loan facility was oversubscribed, raising Dollars
1.7bn, so the 22 participating banks have had their contributions scaled
back accordingly.
The loan is intended to refinance Stora's short-term debt, mainly stemming
from the acquisition last year of Feldmuhle Nobel, the German forestry and
engineering group.
Manufacturers Hanover launched a three-year Dollars 60m syndicated revolving
credit facility for Ratos, the Swedish investment company which has big
shareholdings in companies such as Esselte, Asea, Stora and Industrivarden.
Ratos plans to expand its international activities and is using the facility
as a back-up for its Eurocommercial paper programme.
The interest margin is 55 basis points over Libor, but fees are not being
disclosed.
Manufacturers Hanover and Den Norske Bank are joint arrangers for a Dollars
60m secured five-year loan for Helikopter Service, the Norwegian group which
is Europe's second largest commercial helicopter service and flies workers
to North Sea oil platforms. The loan, in limited syndication, will help
finance the purchase of helicopters as well as the refinancing of two
existing facilities.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Gilts: Market looks ahead to bleak signs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GILTS market is looking ahead to a week of bleak news about the extent
of the UK recession.
The government is likely to announce on Thursday a large rise in
unemployment and a further slump in manufacturing production. A day after
this comes the latest information on inflation, as measured by the retail
price index, which is expected to show that the annual rate of increase was
just over 6 per cent last month, from 8.2 per cent in March.
Whether the government will use the latest economic indicators as an
opportunity to make a further cut in base rates, now at 12 per cent, is
hotly contested.
The Bank of England has already made its views known. Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank governor, issued a thinly veiled warning last week
about the dangers of cutting interest rates too quickly.
The Bank is especially worried about underlying inflation - usually measured
by the RPI, less the effects of the poll tax and mortgage payments - which
is falling far less rapidly than the 'headline' rate.
According to this argument, the expected fall in the RPI is explained more
by technical factors, related to changes in the poll tax and interest rates,
than by continued signs of demand being squeezed due to recessionary forces.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton's statement was followed on Friday by the Bank lending to
the money market at the prevailing base rate of 12 per cent for two weeks -
a move which underlined the Bank's view that an imminent cut in rates would
be inappropriate.
Despite the Bank's signals, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has the final
say over monetary policy.
He may feel that recessionary conditions are so tough that a  1/2 percentage
point cut is justified - as part of the series of moves which have brought
base rates down by 2 percentage points since February. Even more to the
point, a cut in rates this week might help the Conservatives' chances of
winning the general election, which could be held later this year.
In the gilts market, the expectation is that Mr Lamont will cut rates soon.
This sentiment helped to bring down yields at the short end of the market
over the past week, while those for long-dated gilts stayed virtually static
in lacklustre trading. In deference to the Bank's views, some believe Mr
Lamont may make his announcement not on Friday, at the time of the RPI
figures, but a few days later.
If Bank officials are looking forward to this week's events with a certain
grim foreboding, they are probably glad to have last week out of the way.
What had been an embarrassment to the Bank - a tranche of Pounds 800m-worth
of 9 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 2008 which had remained unsold for
a month - was disposed of last Wednesday by the straightforward move of
cutting the price by 2 points.
The manoeuvre led to sniping by some gilt specialists, who reckoned the
market-makers buying the securities gained too much of a bargain. Some
eyebrows were raised because the Bank sold the stock at a price of 1/16 less
than the market price. This discrepancy meant the Bank (and ultimately the
taxpayer) gained from the transaction some Pounds 500,000 less than it would
have done by selling at the market price.
However, to show that it was not put off by the episode, the Bank announced
on Friday the sale of Pounds 200m-worth of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock
 -one segment worth Pounds 100m carrying a maturity in 2001 and the rest due
in 2011. The securities, available for dealing from today, should be far
easier to sell and should make last week's headaches for the Bank seem like
a bad dream.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Italian Government Bonds: Sentiment strong despite
government action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government bond market appears to have performed impressively
this year in spite of, rather than because of, the actions of government.
The cabinet crisis in April which forced the formation of Italy's 50th
post-war government has threatened to delay several important bond market
reforms, including procedures for reclaiming 12.5 per cent withholding tax
paid by overseas buyers.
Perhaps more seriously, the formation of a four-party coalition had delayed
agreement on spending cuts designed to rein in this year's budget deficit.
This weekend, however, the new cabinet agreed a budget package to bring the
deficit back to the target of L132,000bn, or 10 per cent of gross national
product.
Before the cabinet agreement, bond yields had continued to fall. The first
10-year government bond issue launched in February at a net yield of 12.64
per cent currently yields around 11.6 per cent, 10 basis points lower than
at the end of April. Analysts say lower yields stem from consistent overseas
buying of Italian government paper. As in other higher-yielding markets such
as Spain, international buying has been based on the view that exchange rate
co-operation will force yields down to the level of the lowest-yielding
market in the European monetary system - Germany.
'A lot of international fund managers have accepted the idea of convergence
of European bond markets and are shopping around for bargains,' said one
London-based money manager. 'Fixed-income investors have taken to behaving
like equity investors.'
The inflow of foreign funds into Italy has meant an easing of short-term
interest rates, with three-month money rates falling from 11 3/8 per cent in
late April to 10 7/8 per cent last week. Yesterday the Bank of Italy cut the
discount rate by one percentage point to 11.5 per cent, effective today.
Overseas buying has also been in evidence in the Eurobond market, where
borrowers such as Volkswagen, Barclays Bank and Credit Local de France, have
tapped international demand for Lira-denominated securities.
The Euro-lira sector has been dominated by supranational borrowers such as
the European Investment Bank and the World Bank. Italian investors do not
pay withholding tax on bonds issued by these agencies.
The Italian currency has rewarded the faith of international investors by
remaining strong, within the limits of its 2.25 per cent divergence limit
against the D-Mark. The lira is the second strongest currency within the
European exchange rate mechanism, after the peseta. From L760 against the
D-Mark at the beginning of 1990, the Italian currency now stands at around
L740.
However, dealers suggest this buoyant mood is fragile. It has been spurred
by the anticipation that tax barriers to international investment will be
dismantled. Delay could turn sentiment.
Equally, convergence of European bond markets depends on economic and
monetary integration. Any hint that Italy will not play a full role in the
next stage could leave the government bond market exposed.
Italy's record of economic management has been criticised by the
International Monetary Fund and the Bundesbank. Hence agreement on the
package of spending cuts by the cabinet could be crucial to sustaining the
confidence of bond market investors.

FT  13 MAY 91 / US Money and Credit: Delayed reaction to poor refunding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CURIOUS performance of the US bond markets on Friday afternoon was a
little like that of a tightrope walker who successfully crosses the high
wire, but then slips and falls at the far end from pent-up fright.
And the main reason for the market's sudden fall - the poor reception for
the US Treasury's quarterly refunding - could continue to reverberate for
quite a time yet.
Four-fifths of the way through last week the credit markets were breathing a
collective sigh of relief. The Treasury's record Dollars 37bn refunding on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday was hardly a runaway hit, but at least it
had not spooked the bond market.
Calm seemed to prevail, despite the fact that Thursday's auction of 30-year
bonds attracted the smallest amount of bids since these securities were
first offered to the market on a regular basis in the 1970s. There was only
Dollars 1.41 in bids for every dollar of the Dollars 11.75bn on offer.
And, while the average yield on the bonds sold was 8.21 per cent, in line
with the market's expectations, there was a particularly large 'tail' - the
difference between the average and highest bid  - of three basis points.
That indicated dealers had widely different views of the value of the paper.
Why did this news not send prices plunging immediately?
One reason was that the market was anticipating good figures on inflation on
Friday, which it duly got: the producer price index rose only 0.2 per cent
in April, in line with expectations, in a further demonstration that the
recession is putting the squeeze on inflation - though the bond market is
reluctant to accept this.
When this good news failed to attract fresh buying, however, the initial
relief that the Treasury refunding was over turned to concern over the poor
reception received by the long bond, and prices began to tumble as dealers
tried to cut their inventory ahead of the weekend.
The fall was intensified by a rumour that Californian insurance regulators,
who on Friday clamped strong controls on a troubled insurer, First Capital
Life, were also demanding that it liquidate its junk and investment grade
bond portfolios. The upshot was that the new benchmark long bond closed the
week at 97 7/8 , compared with 99 1/16 in the auction, while the yield rose
from 8.21 to 8.31.
Both factors underline the market's concern about an oversupply of paper,
and this source of anxiety is not about to go away. The Federal government
is anticipating borrowing needs of some Dollars 115bn in the third quarter,
and estimates of its requirements from now to the end of September range as
high as Dollars 155bn. That could cause a lot of indigestion.
However the position may not be quite as bleak as it first appears. Ms
Kathleen Stephansen of securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette points
out that some Dollars 70bn of this may be earmarked to support the
Resolution Trust, which is cleaning up the savings and loans mess, and the
trust may not be able to use that amount in so short a time. Furthermore,
money borrowed for the thrift bail-out does not increase overall demand for
credit and does not stimulate aggregate demand.
Even so, the government's funding requirements could prove even bigger than
now forecast if the economy does not start soon showing signs of an upturn,
which would boost its tax receipts.
The recent spate of economic indicators has been thoroughly confusing. The
optimists - and they include most Wall Street analysts  - insist this is yet
another sign that the US is approaching an economic turning point, as the
downward movement of the last 10 months reaches the bottom of the trough.
However, as yet there have been few signs of an upturn in industry's order
books. The key automotive sector remains flat on its back, and there is some
fear the consumer-led downturn may now be followed by a sizeable drop in
business expenditure.
Another potentially worrying sign is the slow growth in money supply that
re-appeared in April, although this could have been a seasonal freak.
There will be more clues on Monday and Tuesday, with the release of data on
industrial production, retail sales and consumer price inflation in April.
And the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Markets Committee will have
these on hand on Tuesday when it meets to consider monetary policy.
Unless the newly released figures - or the Fed's own preliminary money
supply growth statistics for early May - are dreadful, the central bank
seems unlikely to change its policy, which took the Fed funds rate down to 5
3/4 per cent at the end of April.

NORTHWEST Airlines, the US carrier taken private via a leveraged buy-out,
has reported a Dollars 62m loss after tax in the first quarter of 1991,
writes Nikki Tait in New York.
This compared with a Dollars 39m deficit in the same period a year earlier.
The loss was scored on revenues almost static at Dollars 1.64bn.
Like most of its rivals, Northwest blamed the losses on the effects of the
Gulf war and depressed domestic demand.
Operating costs rose to Dollars 1.76bn, from Dollars 1.72bn.

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Shearson faces losses after
Dollars 144m charge for quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHEARSON Lehman Brothers, the investment banking subsidiary of American
Express, is to take a Dollars 144m pre-tax charge against second-quarter
earnings because of a clampdown last Friday by California's insurance
regulators on a troubled life company in which Shearson holds a large stake.
Analysts expect the write-down to push Shearson into the red, despite the
markets boom which has been boosting Wall Street profits this year. The
brokerage made Dollars 51m in the first quarter.
The losses will also lower the profits of American Express, which faced
severe problems with Shearson in early 1990, when it was forced to inject
hundreds of millions of dollars into the business following a Dollars 915m
loss.
Mr John Garamendi, the recently appointed Californian insurance
commissioner, issued a 'cease and desist' order on Friday against First
Capital Life Insurance, a San Diego-based company whose parent, First
Capital Holdings, is 28 per cent owned by Shearson.
The previous week First Capital Life had faced a flood of customers seeking
to cash in their policies amid reports the company - which has a large
exposure to the junk bond market - faced severe financial problems.
The commissioner's move prevents the company from writing new business or
making payments to its parent, and places a moratorium on policy surrenders
and life insurance policy loans.
The commissioner is seeking longer term solutions to the company's problems,
which could include asset sales and a capital infusion.
Unfounded rumours on Friday that the company had begun selling off its junk
bond portfolio contributed to a sharp afternoon decline in bond prices and a
sympathetic drop in equity markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average
losing 50.98 points on the day.
Shearson's write-down covers all its investment in First Capital Holding.
However, Wall Street analysts say the brokerage house could face further
losses if it had to compensate those holders of First Capital policies who
brought them through Shearson.
Shearson, however, says it believes the insurer has 'the resources to meet
at least the principal payments of policyholders' and it is not in a
position to make any open-ended commitments to them. The company has also
been resisting the commissioner's appeals for it to inject fresh money into
First Capital.

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Germans plan Europe rating
agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GERMAN initiative to develop a new European rating agency is soon to be
promoted in other European countries. The aim is to create an entity which
will cater for local investors' needs in the single market.
Although several small rating agencies already exist in other European
countries, the Germans are keen to develop a single Europe-wide institution,
or at least to harmonise standards across a federation of agencies.
A group of some 20 German companies and institutions, principally inspired
by Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, are poised to set up a project
company which will put the concept to a wider audience, including the French
Italians and Britons.
Those ratings ascribed to debt instruments alert investors to grades of
risks and to changes in those risks. While the process has been less crucial
to the European capital markets than those in America, the two big US
agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, have established a significant
presence in Europe.
Moody's, for instance, claims to rate around 78 per cent of the outstandings
in the Euro D-Mark bond market.
Promoters of the new agency believe that, while the US agencies provide a
highly efficient service for large corporations selling their debt to global
investors, they do not have the capacity to analyse medium-sized companies
in Europe targeting a more specialised investor interest.
The Germans also argue that the American agencies are driven by US
accounting principles and focus on short-term performance criteria that are
less relevant for Europe.
The group points out that the growth of capital market borrowing instruments
reduces companies' dependence on bank-financed debt, which in turn increases
the importance of ratings.
The new agency should allow less well-known companies to reach new investors
anywhere in Europe, through the common language of a simple debt
classification. Commercial paper, medium-term notes, and multi-currency
bonds would all be candidates for ratings, according to working party
outlines.
German interest in the project has been spurred by the recent development of
a D-Mark commercial paper market, permitted since the beginning of the year.
It already has outstandings of around DM1bn, issued by only a handful of
borrowers.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Palma drops dividend on Pounds 2m losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES HAVE deepened at Palma Group, the Leicester-based textile company, in
the 13 months to January 31.
From a deficit of Pounds 246,000 in the year 1989, the group declined to
losses of Pounds 2m pre-tax. This came on turnover down at Pounds 29.93m
(Pounds 31.98m), though continuing activities contributed Pounds 18.04m
(Pounds 17.75m).
Mr Peter Bailey, chairman, said that 'in a very tough period, trading
conditions were as bad as at any time' in the board's memory. At the outset
there was low demand and it had deteriorated further. The result was
affected by an exceptional provision of Pounds 240,000 (nil) for
reorganisation at Pex, and increased interest of Pounds 1.56m (Pounds
707,000).
Losses per share totalled 7.97p (0.83p) and the dividend is passed. The
total payout last time was 3.7p.
During the 13 months, the Montfort Somercotes subsidiary was closed, and
certain of the Clothkits mail order assets and its name were sold to
Freemans, the catalogue operation.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Racal demerger plans face delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILED plans for the demerger of Racal Electronics, which Sir Ernest
Harrison, the UK electronics group's chairman is due to announce with the
interim results in June, may not be fulfilled before next year.
With less than a month until the plan is to be presented to shareholders,
Racal has still not appointed new non-executive directors who will need to
decide what to do with Racal Electronics' Pounds 375m of debt ahead of the
proposed flotation of Racal Chubb.
Sir Ernest is expected to announce on June 12 the timing of the first stage
of the demerger - the hand-out to shareholders of Racal Electronics' 80 per
cent share in Racal Telecom, the subsidiary that operates Vodafone, the
world's largest cellular radio telephone network.
But before the proposed flotation of Chubb, Racal's wholly owned security
subsidiary, new non-executive directors will have to scrutinise how much of
the debt should be left with the 'rump' of Racal Electronics.
Last November, when Sir Ernest announced he would break up Racal after what
he said was the market's persistent under-valuation of the group, he
promised to appoint independent directors early in the new year.
Sir Ernest has said he will lead a management buy-out team once the
slimmed-down Racal Electronics had traded for an appropriate time in the
market.
The amount of debt carried by the slimmed down Racal Electronics would have
a bearing both on how easily Sir Ernest could find MBO finance and the
financial return for the MBO team, analysts say.
Racal Telecom already has a quotation and would not be encumbered by any of
its parent's debt. As a result, the first stage of Sir Ernest's plan would
not require the scrutiny of new independent directors, analysts say.
Racal Electronics and its advisers, NM Rothschild, have been talking to
potential new non-executive directors and are expected to announce the new
appointments no later than June.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Radio Clyde falls 42%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RADIO CLYDE Holdings, the Glasgow-based commercial radio company that
recently merged with Radio Forth, was hit by a slump in national advertising
in the first half of the year.
Pre-tax profit fell by nearly 42 per cent to Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 1.2m) on
turnover down 26 per cent to Pounds 3.46m (Pounds 4.68m) in the six months
to March 31. National advertising revenue fell by 39 per cent, whereas the
local decline was only 5 per cent.
At the half-way stage, Clyde had Pounds 3m cash and had earned Pounds
220,000 (Pounds 180,000) in interest. Mr John Bowman, finance director, said
the war chest was still intact after the all-share Radio Forth deal. The
group's ambitions for growth extended to local radio south of the border as
well as to a possible bid for the first national commercial station.
It has taken a 40 per cent stake in Buzz FM a new statio in Birmingham, and
increased its stake in Satellite Media Services to 28.6 per cent.
Earnings per share fell to 7.3p (12.2p). The interim dividend is held at
3.25p, but cost goes up to Pounds 291,000 (Pounds 205,000) because of
payments to former holders of Forth shares.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: CRS hits Pounds 45m and lifts market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CO-OPERATIVE Retail Services achieved a 14 per cent increase in trading
surplus to Pounds 44.9m for the year to January 26, despite depressed
conditions in its sector.
Mr Harry Moore, chief executive of the UK's largest retail co-operative
society, added that CRS had taken market share from competitors as net sales
moved ahead by 11 per cent to Pounds 1.29bn (Pounds 1.16bn).
In particular, he highlighted the performance of the non-food division where
sales had risen by 14 per cent to Pounds 191m and trading surplus by 34 per
cent. Home furnishing and electrical goods had especially defied national
trends.
Mr Moore thought the non-food division, which aimed to sell middle-market
products, had benefited during the recession as customers focused on
achieving value for money.
On the non-food side, CRS claimed it was the UK's fifth largest department
store operator with 49 shops, many of which have adopted the Living format,
and 11 specialised stores including five Homeworld outlets.
However, the society's dominant activity is in food retailing, where it
claims at least 3.5 per cent of the UK grocery market with 480 outlets.
These include about 100 Leo's out-of-town superstores as well as the more
traditional Stop &amp; Shop corner shops. Both have a strong emphasis on price.
Purchase of the Cambridge Society last October helped boost sales of the
division which rose by 12.5 per cent to Pounds 944m. On a like-for-like
basis, they would have increased by nearly 11 per cent. There was a 13.5 per
cent rise in trading surplus.
The inclusion of Cambridge's borrowings was a factor behind a sharp increase
in CRS's net interest payments to Pounds 14.31m (Pounds 10.04m). Operating
surplus, struck after payments of interest on CRS's shares and grants and
donations, fell to Pounds 19.91m (Pounds 20.04m). The retained surplus was
Pounds 22.61m (Pounds 23.35m).
A change in CRS's constitution later this month will alter substantially its
relationship with the Co-operative Wholesale Society. This follows the
abandonment of merger talks last summer.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Logitek says yes to Microvitec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOGITEK, the computer services group, has finally agreed to a revised offer
from Microvitec, the computer peripherals maker from which it had been
fighting off a hostile takeover bid.
Logitek is recommending a new and higher offer by Microvitec of 20 Logitek
shares for 21 Microvitec shares, which values the company at approximately
Pounds 3.5m. This compares with the one-for-one all share offer which valued
Logitek at Pounds 3.3m.
Microvitec had already acquired or agreed to acquire 22.5 per cent of
Logitek's ordinary capital. The agreement ends Microvitec's one and a half
month struggle for Logitek through which it sought to create an enlarged
group andturn round its flagging fortunes.
'Unless you're small and innovative and keep coming out with super products,
to have any chance of survival in the electronics industry you've got to
have size,' says Mr James Bailey, the chairman of Microvitec.
'With the Logitek deal going through, we can expect 1992 to be a super
year,' he added.
Microvitec was not as fortunate in its bid to raise approximately Pounds
2.56m through a rights issue of 14.4m new ordinary shares to help fund the
acquisition.
The issue, while fully underwritten, closed with only 6.22 per cent of
acceptances.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRISTOPHER Stewart Smith is resigning as chairman of Conder, the
Winchester-based construction and property group which last month announced
it had fallen deeply into loss in 1990.
Mr Michael Pelham, managing director, also plans to resign from the board at
the annual meeting next month.
Mr Stewart Smith, a former director of P&amp;O who took over as chairman of
Conder in 1987, is to remain as a director until a replacement non-executive
chairman is appointed.
Mr Alan Lovell, finance director, takes over as acting chief executive.
The shares closed 3p lower on Friday at 46p.
Last month, Conder said it had been driven into a 1990 pre-tax loss of
Pounds 19.29m. Losses on curtain walling contracts for two City office
developments were at the heart of the fall. That came after a strong
performance in 1989 when pre-tax profits soared by 67 per cent to Pounds
10.42m.
Heavily geared at the last year-end, Conder has since sharply reduced
borrowings with the sale of properties and a forecourt services business.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 70m write-down at Ensign Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in the value of its unlisted investments resulted in a Pounds
69.7m write-down at the interim stage for Ensign Trust, which has recently
faced the possibility of being wound down by the Merchant Navy Officers
Pension Fund, its largest shareholder.
Net asset value per share at March 31 totalled 53.6p, a decline of 57.52p on
the 111.12p standing 12 months earlier
In addition to the write-down, which was equivalent to 23p per share, a
further write-down of Pounds 17.8m has been made in the unlisted investment
portfolio, equivalent to 5.9p per share.
For the half year to March 31 the trust reported a loss before tax of Pounds
58,000 compared with a profit of Pounds 75,000 previously. The Pounds 44,000
surplus available to shareholders in the previous half-year was reversed in
the revenue account to a deficit of Pounds 567,000.
Losses per ordinary share amounted to 0.19p (earnings 0.03p) and a
same-again interim dividend of 0.3p per share is being paid. However, the
board does not expect to recommend payment of a final dividend.
Borrowings increased by Pounds 26.23m to Pounds 118.18m (Pounds 91.94m).
The group is looking to gradually reduce the unquoted portfolio proportion
of its overall assets.
Disposals will be made with a view to receiving full value for the
investments, and the proceeds will go to reducing the level of its gearing,
it said.
The group warned that the loss of income from Argosy Asset Management,
formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary, would reduce future revenues. Argosy,
which was considered unable to continue to operate autonomously after it
lost its contract to manage the MNOPF's investment portfolio, was acquired
by Ivory &amp; Sime, which took over management of Ensign Trust's investments
from Argosy.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Pirelli treads a careful path on Continental: The latest
twist in the saga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The man from Mercedes-Benz was astounded. A Pirelli manager had just offered
a big tyre price reduction, something the German luxury car company had
neither asked for nor expected.
With stories like this, it is no wonder some analysts say the tyre industry
almost seems to have a death wish. Tyre producers have indulged in an orgy
of price-slashing. This has depressed their own selling prices even further
at a time of crisis in the industry and left the car companies crowing with
delight.
As tyremakers' profits have been decimated, due both to the motor industry's
tough cost-cutting efforts and their own aggressive competition, car
producers have enjoyed price cuts of more than 20 per cent in the past year
or so. Adding to the tyre manufacturer's woes is the downturn in vehicle
sales in some European markets after the steep decline in the US. On new car
business, says Mr Philip Wylie, motor analyst with Salomon Brothers in
London, 'they're all losing money on each tyre they make'.
It is against this background that the latest, almost melodramatic, phase in
the tussle between Italy's Pirelli and Continental of Germany has been
played out. Having been rebuffed in its first attempt at merger talks,
Pirelli has succeeded in getting so-called 'round table' discussions under
way. And the man who so vigorously kept Pirelli at bay, Mr Horst Urban,
Continental's combative chief executive, has had to go.
His departure was announced on Friday. Mr Urban had initially found it easy,
helped by Morgan Grenfell, Continental's UK merchant bank adviser, to shoot
down Pirelli's suggested merger terms. These would have basically involved
Continental paying a high price to take over Pirelli's tyre assets, but then
ceding management control to Milan.
At this stage, it is anyone's guess what will happen. Clearly, a merger
looks far more likely, but it is still by no means a foregone conclusion.
Nor is it entirely apparent that an amalgamation would produce significant
benefits. Despite the big international takeovers in the tyre industry, such
as Japan's Bridgestone buying Firestone, and Michelin of France taking over
Uniroyal-Goodrich, the aggressive pricing tactics of the big manufacturers
continue. Michelin, which has announced big job cuts, is seen as one of the
top price-cutters.
'Competition has been stepped up another pace,' says Mr John Lawson, motor
analyst with Nomura Research in London. 'The US market is going from bad to
worse, so the timing of the acquisitions everyone has made there look
disastrous.' This obviously also includes Continental's own purchase of
General Tire, now feeling the brunt of the US automotive slump.
Pirelli's argument, which claims support from owners of more than 51 per
cent of Continental's shares - including 5 per cent in its own hands - is
that the need for a merger is strengthened by the crisis. It has outlined
big savings on production, marketing and development, as well as
geographical advantages. Continental has admitted savings could be made, but
disputes their size.
In the end, Mr Urban's uncompromising tone proved too discordant for the
supervisory board, which forced him out last week. His backing, even from
the labour representatives, dissolved as it apparently became clear that the
company, and the industry, was in a worse situation than he had portrayed it
 -especially in the viciously competitive US market. The feeling grew that
discussions with Pirelli should be pursued more constructively.
The head of the non-executive supervisory board is Mr Ulrich Weiss, an
executive of Deutsche Bank, which also owns Morgan Grenfell. At a
supervisory board meeting on the Friday before last he clashed with Mr Urban
 -embittered sources in Continental talk of provocation. Mr Urban told Mr
Weiss after the meeting that he would resign if the board did not support
him.
It was that issue which the board met to discuss in Hanover on Thursday.
Lining up with Mr Weiss was Mr Friedrich Schiefer, finance director and
chief executive-designate of the Allianz insurance group. Allianz holds 5
per cent of Continental's stock and is thought to be in the Pirelli camp.
They, it is believed, were joined by Mr Gunther Sassmannshausen, former head
of the Preussag steel and metals group, Mr Ernst Pieper, chief executive of
Preussag, and Mr Klaus Piltz, chairman of the Veba energy group.
Faced with such weighty opposition, Mr Urban agreed to go. He is succeeded
by 60-year old Mr Wilhelm Winterstein, six years older and generally seen as
an interim choice. Mr Winterstein, previously purchasing director, has been
in the tyre business for 35 years and is thought more likely to enter into
talks with Pirelli in a positive spirit.
In Milan, the Italian company has built a wall of silence around its
headquarters, saying nothing about where, when, or at what level these talks
will take place. The company is avoiding triumphalism - otherwise obvious in
the Italian press. But by stressing the need for 'the utmost
confidentiality' in the discussions with Continental, it is acknowledging
the delicate balance in Germany which has tipped the scales against Mr
Urban.
Thus, the traditionally taciturn Pirelli is more circumspect than ever for
fear of triggering an adverse reaction in Germany which might embarrass its
supporters there. The most sensitive issue is control of the combined tyres
operation, if a merger comes about.
Despite the strong trading links between Italy and Germany, Italian
companies are much less conspicuous in the German market than vice versa.
Not only does the short-termism often evident in Italy's business sector
clash with longer-range German practices, but Italian companies often face
severe image problems in Germany. Their relative absence there reflects the
tendency to concentrate on southern Europe and the immense difficulties
which Italian businessmen often have in finding high-quality German
managers.
Thus, apart from discussions on valuations and the structure of any merger,
control is likely to be the trickiest issue that Pirelli must address.
Nevertheless, its mood marks a sharp change from the bitter words of the
letter it issued to shareholders last February following the decision by
Continental's supervisory board not to pursue talks.
Pirelli referred angrily to the inconsistency of the response shown towards
its plans by 'the heads of some major German institutions'. Although these
were not named, the reference to Mr Weiss was unmistakeable. Pirelli claimed
that he initially 'gave his agreement and support' to its tyre merger
proposal. Deutsche Bank, in turn, accused Pirelli of acting in a way that
was 'misleading and thus likely to produce a false impression'.
That atmosphere of tit-for-tat accusations has now evaporated. But when the
final chapter of this saga is written, the position of Germany's biggest
bank - and the issue of bank-industry links and boardroom representation in
Germany in general - will warrant special attention. So will the need for
comprehensive, stringent takeover and share disclosure rules. For while the
Pirelli-Continental affair will not make bid-sensitive German executives
quake in their boots, it has added a fascinating but more uncertain
dimension to Germany's mergers and acquisitions scene.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Economics Notebook: Election fever haunts UK policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are difficult days for knowing what is happening in the British
economy. But it is as good a time as any for evaluating the policy
priorities of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
The UK's usual statistical fog is being compounded by political noise as
both leading parties appear determined to stay on election alert.
So far, the most obvious symptom of this double malaise has been Mr Lamont's
tendency to accentuate the positive side of UK economic developments in his
recent public statements.
But with pressure rising among Tory backbenchers and in financial markets
for another cut in British bank base rates from their current 12 per cent
level, there is a risk that the noise will direct economic policy and drive
a wedge between the Bank of England and the Treasury.
Signs of incipient tension emerged last week. In a lecture at Exeter
University, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England,
underlined that the big fall in the retail prices index for April, which is
expected to be published on Friday, should not be interpreted as a sign that
underlying inflation is falling as sharply.
Using veiled 'central bank speak', Mr Leigh Pemberton voiced his own and the
Bank's belief that there should be a pause before base rates fall further,
following their 2 percentage point drop from 14 per cent in the two months
between mid-February and mid-April. Last Friday, the Bank hammered home this
message in its money market operations by lending Pounds 965m at the base
rate level of 12 per cent for 14 days.
Throughout last week, however, financial markets chose to believe that
interest rates would fall soon. The domestic money market betted heavily
that Friday's big RPI drop would be the occasion for another 0.5 percentage
point base rate cut. It was encouraged by the expectation that the annual
rate of RPI inflation in April will have fallen to about 6 per cent from 8.2
per cent in March as the impact of last year's poll tax bills drops out of
the index. The Nationwide Anglia Building Society last week pre-empted such
a move by cutting its mortgage rates by 0.7 per cent.
Until recently, the Treasury and Bank appeared equally concerned about
underlying inflation. It is probably still the case that Treasury officials
would like some delay in the downward movement of interest rates to evaluate
the economic effects of the cuts already made.
But it is also possible to detect some difference in tone over monetary
policy between the Bank and Treasury. The Treasury's reaction to last week's
developments was muted. While the Bank was sticking its neck out against an
interest rate cut, officials in Whitehall said the Treasury was 'agnostic'
over whether conditions would soon be right for a base rate move.
All of which brings us back to Mr Lamont. He earned a reputation as an iron
chancellor in his early months in Number 11 Downing Street, as he carried
out the tough counter-inflationary policy that his predecessor, Mr John
Major, summed up with the words: 'If it isn't hurting, it isn't working.'
But Mr Lamont sang a different tune when in Washington last month for the
spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Then the
talk was of recovery 'round the corner' as he forecast that Britain would
reduce its inflation rate to near-European levels 'within a very short
period of time'.
The chancellor's comments about economic recovery came at a time when
Britain's economic statistics are more than usually confusing. His
confidence was based almost entirely on the latest quarterly survey of
industrial trends from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). In
particular, he picked on the CBI's report of a partial recovery in business
optimism as a sign that forward-looking economic indicators were pointing
his way.
Since then, other surveys by the Institute of Directors and 3i, the
investment capital group, have indicated a revival of confidence among
businessmen. In addition, the Central Statistical Office's (CSO)
longer-leading cyclical indicator has turned sharply upwards since the
beginning of the year. It may be indicating a revival in the economy over
the next six months.
But the good news in all these indicators - including the CSO leading
indicator - is limited to measures of expectations and confidence.
Last week's newspaper headlines telling of job losses in companies such as
Rolls-Royce suggested that the economy is still in recession. This week's
indicators of economic activity, covering unemployment and industrial
production in April and March respectively, are unlikely to lift the gloom.
The City scents that Mr Lamont, in seeing recovery through the statistical
fog, has chosen to put as positive a gloss as possible on economic
developments for political reasons.
His statement that recovery was round the corner came just days before the
May 2 local government elections. If anything, the political pressure on the
chancellor to enhance the 'feel good' factor in the economy has increased
since then. Quite apart from excitement over a possible general election,
this Thursday sees another by-election test for the government in Monmouth -
which has been a safe Conservative seat.
For these reasons, some City analysts have suggested that the base rate cut
could come as early as Wednesday, when the Treasury should have its first
insight into the April RPI and conveniently ahead of the Monmouth vote.
Such a move is far from certain. It would be odd in view the Bank's firm
action on the money markets last week, but not unprecedented. It would also
have to be judged against the economic data that has still to be released
this week.
But with election fever running strongly, the chancellor may find it
difficult to square his political instincts with his job as custodian of the
nation's economic welfare.
Over the next few weeks, the electorate, financial markets and international
investors should be better able to judge whether Mr Lamont's first priority
is defeating inflation - as he has always professed - or whether he is more
anxious to secure victory for his party at the polls.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Liffe plan for lira futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) is developing a
futures contract on Italian government bonds. If plans to launch the
contract later this year go ahead, it will be the first futures contract
denominated in lira.
The exchange has completed a feasibility study, according to Mr Michael
Jenkins, Liffe's chief executive. 'Our aim is to have some sort of
co-operation with the Italian authorities,' he said.
The contract would be based on Buoni del Tesoro Poiennali (BTPs), domestic
government bonds of a type with maturities between four and 10 years.
The Italian government bond market is the third largest in the world, after
Japan and the US. However, it ranks much lower in turnover, as much of the
market is held by small domestic investors, and high proportions of
instruments are short-dated and floating-rate.
However, the Italian government has begun to extend the maturity profile of
its debt. Since the beginning of March, the government has issued L10,000bn
(Pounds 4.6bn) of 10-year BTPs in three tranches.
The Italian authorities also last month eased procedures for the reclaiming
of withholding tax for foreign investors. It is expected that the tax will
eventually be abolished.
The Italian bond market has attracted considerable overseas investment this
year, partly due to such measures.
Total turnover in BTPs is believed to be in the region of L3,000bn daily.
About 40 per cent of that business is believed to be conducted in London.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Brent Walker to unveil Pounds 1bn write-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the heavily-borrowed UK leisure group, is expected to disclose
a write-down in the value of property and assets from Pounds 1.1bn, net of
debt, to about Pounds 100m when it announces its preliminary results for
1990 on Wednesday.
The disastrous figures have prompted some of the group's bankers, which are
collectively owed Pounds 1.4bn by Brent Walker, to talk privately of ousting
Mr George Walker, the chairman and chief executive, who engineered the
group's rapid rise in the 1980s.
But, according to a source close to the company, neither Mr Walker nor other
Brent Walker directors had heard from any bankers and the chairman had 'no
intention of stepping down'.
Mr Walker and Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, are planning to present
proposals for a financial restructuring to bankers, led by Standard
Chartered, after the preliminary results are announced.
It is understood that Brent Walker will propose to cut debt to almost Pounds
1bn by the year-end with asset sales. This could lead to the sale of the
Brighton marina, the Puerto Sherry marina in Spain, a 50 per cent share in
London's Trocadero, the retail, leisure and office complex, and hotels and
casinos.
The refinancing plan is also expected to propose that Brent Walker retains
the pub retailing division and William Hill, the profitable betting shop
chain it bought for Pounds 685m from Grand Metropolitan in 1989.
However, the banks are believed to be anxious about Mr Walker's desire to
keep William Hill. The chain is one of Brent Walker's most saleable assets.
Last autumn, the Bank of England was widely thought to have urged restraint
on Brent Walker's more hawkish bankers, amid an uncertain economic
atmosphere. The Bank is being kept informed of negotiations.
The banks demanded a financial restructuring as a condition of their
agreement last November, which froze capital repayments until the end of
this year.
Brent Walker's 1990 assets will exclude the Pounds 160m which it says it is
owed by Grand Metropolitan as a partial refund on the purchase price of
William Hill. Brent Walker demanded the refund because it said the chain's
profits were not as high as GrandMet had stated.
It withheld payment of a final Pounds 50m instalment on the purchase price
until the dispute over the Pounds 160m could be settled by arbitration. In
January, the High Court ruled that Brent Walker should pay the Pounds 50m.
It has not yet paid.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Managers cautious on US equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH institutional fund managers remain optimistic about the prospects
for UK and Japanese equities, but are becoming noticeably more cautious
about US stocks, a Gallup survey revealed yesterday.
A monthly poll of institutional investors produced by Gallup for the
securities group, Smith New Court, also found that fund managers intend to
increase their weighting in UK property and run down their holdings of cash.
It is widely believed that the British economy will improve over the next
year, with only 4 per cent expecting it to deteriorate further.
Base rates are forecast on average to fall to 10.3 per cent in a year's
time.
Investors are enthusiastic about the outlook for global equities over the
next year, with the FT-SE 100 index expected to rise from 2523 at the time
of polling last week, to a mean 2747, the Dow Jones Average from 2939 to
3113, and the Nikkei index from 26,478 to 29,064.
However, in the short term, investors appear to be taking a more cautious
view of the equity markets.
Bulls of the UK market over the next three months outnumbered bears by only
3 per cent. A balance of 22 per cent was bearish about the US market and 12
per cent more were bearish about the continental European markets.
The May survey covered 92 institutions handling funds totalling Pounds

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: Secession in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DALJIT SEHBAI.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to Joe Rogaly's article on India ('Passage to India',
April 23) and the subsequent letter from Mr Pritam Singh (May 3), while
there may well be a good case for decentralisation in India, by giving more
powers to the states, this should not be confused with the aims of those
demanding secession.
Less centralisation could be good for India, but allowing secession of any
part of the country should not be encouraged. It would weaken India and
damage regional stability. Daljit Sehbai,

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: Bank's role

   From Mr ROBIN HUTTENBACH.

<TEXT>
Sir, As the director of a small company that would not be in business
without the help my bank has given me over the years, I think that Mr F X
O'Malley (Letters, May 2) is wrong in suggesting that managers should visit
their customers.
Surely his time and that of his bank manager would be better employed by
making sure that he regularly updates his company's cash flow and any other
financial projections deemed necessary. From my experience, this should be
done at least once a month and the information then forwarded to the bank
manager for review. Far from being a subjective approach, this is the best
method I know for detecting problems at an early stage.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: SQM - privatisation, investment and capital
expenditure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICIO CONTESSE.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On December 19 1990, the FT published an article which contained
several inaccuracies about Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA (SQM). We
would like to correct the most important errors.
SQM was privatised in 1988 with many shares being taken up by its employees.
SQM is therefore run for the benefit of not only its shareholders but also
its employees as employees are shareholders. Your article wrongly suggests
that employees were duped out of their shares in Pampa Calichera. The
correct position is that the shares of this company were purchased by
Sociedad de Inversiones Pampa Grande SA The purchase was made in order to
defeat a hostile and risky takeover bid mounted by foreign investor
competitors of SQM. The majority of the shares in Oro Blanco, Pampa Grande
and Pampa Calichera continue to be owned by employees of SQM and its
subsidiaries.
Over the past three years, SQM has made a significant investment of more
than Dollars 13m in building houses and in improving current housing
conditions of its employees in Maria Elena and Pedro de Valdivia. SQM's
employees earn on average between Dollars 600 and Dollars 700 a month. The
minimum monthly wage in Chile is about Dollars 75. Moreover, free housing,
water, electricity and schooling, together with subsidised health service
and transportation, are also provided to SQM's employees.
Although your article correctly records planned future expenditure of
Dollars 238m on plant improvements, it did not mention that since SQM's
plants were built in 1930 they have been constantly updated and modernised;
in the past three years alone more than Dollars 90m has been spent on plant
improvements. On average, SQM's plants are less than 10 years old.
SQM is a publicly listed company strictly controlled by the Chilean SEC,
with a well-known board of directors and with no political allegiance to
previous or current regimes in Chile.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Mr Lilley and competition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, has repeatedly emphasised
his commitment to free competition. However, the effectiveness of government
policies intended to promote that objective is blunted by a number of
anomalies and shortcomings. Mr Lilley should use his promised statement on
competition issues, due in the next two months, to set out a more coherent
approach.
His first priority should be to end the confusion created by his own
ill-judged efforts to tighten scrutiny of UK acquisitions by foreign
state-controlled bidders. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission has blocked
only one of the five such deals referred to it - and then chiefly on grounds
of market share. As Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of the Office of
Fair Trading put it last week, the discrepancy between Mr Lilley's stance
and the MMC's findings has thrown merger policy into disarray.
The legality of Mr Lilley's position is also doubtful. The Rome Treaty
explicitly prohibits discrimination between private and publicly-owned
companies, and state control is not recognised as a criterion by the
European Community's merger policy, which takes precedence over national
regulations in controlling large deals. That is not to dismiss Mr Lilley's
underlying anxiety that state-owned companies enjoy unfair financial
advantages. But the sensible solution is to impose more transparency and
discipline on governments' dealings with nationalised industries, as EC
competition authorities are seeking to do.
New legislation
Britain also needs to align itself with EC practice by giving the OFT powers
against cartels comparable to those enjoyed by Brussels. At present, it is
difficult to curb UK restrictive trade practices unless they involve wider
Community interests. A White Paper proposing to correct this anomaly has
gathered dust for almost two years. Mr Lilley should commit himself to
introducing legislation in the next Parliament.
The biggest challenge, however, is to ensure the long-term consistency and
impartiality of competition policy. That can be assured only if it is
insulated from the unpredictable impact of short-run political influences.
As an outspoken critic of government intervention, Mr Lilley should
recognise the value of reforms to entrench that principle.
Strengthen OFT
The first should be to strengthen the role of the OFT, at present mainly an
adviser to government. It should be given at least as much autonomy as
regulators of privatised utilities, which are formally not part of Whitehall
and report directly to Parliament. Like them, the OFT should also have the
authority to refer cases to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
That power should, as a minimum, extend to mergers, where the wide
discretion at present enjoyed by the trade and industry secretary is hardly
conducive to firm and consistent policy. An independent OFT, immune from the
intense political lobbying which often accompanies large mergers, would be
far better placed to decide objectively whether they should be referred.
Clarity and efficiency would be further served by publishing the principles
and precedents employed by the MMC and by requiring its members to serve on
a full-time basis.
There may also be a case for entrusting the OFT with some surveillance over
the regulators of privatised industries. Though the record of the regulators
to date is encouraging, their performance should be subject to independent
scrutiny. That is particularly true in industries such as
telecommunications, where the government retains influence.
In some respects, the power of national competition authorities is being
eroded by Brussels. That makes it all the more important, however, that they
pursue policies consistent with the EC approach and enforce them just as
vigorously. If the stiffer competition expected after 1992 is to produce its
full benefits, it needs to be promoted within countries as well as between
them. This is a point that the Labour party, as well as Mr Lilley, should
keep in mind.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Leading Article: US versus the World Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE US administration wants a greater emphasis by the World Bank on the
private sector, it has an odd way of showing it. The main manifestation so
far has been its blocking last week of agreement to an increase in capital
for the part of the World Bank group created specifically to help the
private sector: the International Finance Corporation.
The IFC, which enjoyed growth of 20 per cent a year in the late 1980s,
claims its expansion has been constrained this year by a lack of capital.
The longer the delay, the more it will be hampered from doing its job in
future.
The price the US wants for its assent to a capital increase is a more
explicit focus by the World Bank group on the private sector. Once this
price has been paid, the US has said that an increase of Dollars 750m should
be considered, instead of the doubling of its Dollars 1.3bn in capital that
the IFC is seeking.
The most significant suggestion from the US - that the World Bank might lend
directly to the private sector - would require a change in the Bank's
articles of association and implies a profound shift in Bank strategy. Yet,
however frustrating they may find US tactics, many are prepared to concede
that, up to a point, the US has a point, The Bank could work more closely
with the IFC and should do more to help the private sector.
The question is how. A distinction must be made between helping the private
sector and lending directly to it. The former does not entail the latter and
the latter does not imply the former. It is equally important to remember
what direct lending to the private sector would signify. World Bank lending
to the private sector with government guarantees would reinforce government
meddling in the private sector. But lending to the private sector without a
guarantee could threaten its credit rating.
More risk
Some might argue that the World Bank should bear more risk, but the
implications could be grave. Consider the IFC itself. It has been bolstered
by its successful equity investments in Third World stock markets and
companies, but the performance of its loan portfolio has been weak.
The fundamental question is how far direct lending to the private sector
would further the World Bank's development aims. One powerful case can be
made for such lending. The current policy means that the World Bank can give
help to state-owned companies, but not to private companies that do the same
job. That constraint on the Bank acts as a disincentive to privatisation and
an obstacle to involvement with privatised companies.
Important worries
Yet there are also important worries. In many developing countries it is
small and medium-sized businesses that most need additional capital. Since
the Bank is unable to assess the viability of such borrowers directly, it
has to rely on intermediaries to do the job. In the past, these
intermediaries have often proved ineffective and sometimes corrupt.
The value of lending by the World Bank to big private sector companies is
more debatable still. If such a company is not creditworthy, the Bank should
not lend to it; if it is creditworthy, loans from the Bank may merely keep
it out of private capital markets.
It is also important to remember that the World Bank has a unique role in
funding what will remain public functions in most developing countries:
education, for example, or large scale irrigation, or roads. Any change in
World Bank policy must not threaten its ability to raise money and lend for
such purposes.
In short, the Bank should listen to the US; it should improve its
understanding of the private sector; and it should consider direct lending
to it - but only on a limited basis and, if possible, through expansion of
the activities of the IFC.
For its part, the US should remember both that helping the private sector
does not entail lending directly to it and that development was not brought
about by the private sector alone even within the US. Not least, it should
heed its own advice about the importance of the private sector and back a
substantial capital increase for the IFC.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Peer Gynt - Berlin Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While A Doll's House and John Gabriel Borkman play among the magic dozen at
the Berlin Theatre Festival (to May 20), the Deutsches Theater's sparkling
new Peer Gynt gives Berlin audiences the rare fortune of seeing significant
productions of early, middle and late Ibsen all within a fortnight.
In this context, what a revelation the poet of Peer Gynt is - lyrical,
witty, infinitely various. Morality, introspection, the rumbling, grumbling
later playwright, these just peep through in Fredo Solter's interpretation,
which offers a surprise Ibsen; tongue in cheek, spring in step, spirit
soaring.
Solter's is the lightest, brightest Ibsen staging I have seen. Clouds and
stars, fjords and floods, cut across a giant gauze sheet which revolves with
the seasons - autumnal brown, midsummer blue. Against this ever-unrolling
backcloth, mood and timbre change as delicately as in Grieg's Peer Gynt
suite; cool pastels for Solveig, burning red for the troll orgies, hard
yellow sun and green moon for the exotic wanderings.
A cornucopia of images, animals, masks, music, taped voices, suggest the
whirlpool of Peer Gynt's mind. Claudia Geisler's Solveig, straw-hatted and
flaxen-haired, stands like a Nordic Tess of the d'Urbervilles against the
midnight sun. Transvestite trolls, plastic buttocks, tails and fangs
attached, tumble out as from a nightclub down the road, and there's a joke
about their Berlin accents. Peer mounts a troll girl as she mounts an
electric-eyed rhino, tongue spurting flames, and all three whoosh off down a
fjord. Man as beast, cooped up with his own conflicting sexual fantasies;
Ibsen was writing half a century before Freud and the raw fear of Peer's
responses still shocks as something new.
Solter pulls together Peer's youthful imaginings and his later life as
wealthy capitalist as two sides of the same coin. Peer Gynt was written in
the same year (1867) as Das Kapital and Solter plays the speculator's
ventures as no less fantastical than the young man's dreams.
It's a wild, lavish reading of the play - a cast of 25 treble up over 70
parts - yet one with diminishing returns, as each gimmick must work harder
while charming less hypnotically. Solter's vision would fit well into three
hours, yet the play runs for five. The Deutsches Theater, Max Reinhardt's
home in the 1920s and the National Theatre of the former DDR, has a
repertoire of 20 such classical productions and is not a theatre to offer
compromises.
As Peer, Daniel Morgenroth's triumph is to hold the stage despite the
distractions of the zoo. With absolute conviction he grows from gangly youth
to autocrat. His voice - energetic staccato bursts modulating up to panic,
down to reflection - speaks his continuing restlessness. Facial muscles are
never still, knees knock together, hands wrestle with each other nervously.
At once funny and vulnerable, he sweet-talks us into accepting the excess of
his desires while acknowledging their theatricality. Yet each time
Morgenroth pushes beyond the game, and when he comes to peel back the onion
layers of his life at last and finds no kernel to himself, we agonise with
him in his and our own exhaustion.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lenny Kravitz, a one man encyclopaedia of pop, wowed them at the Academy on
Saturday. This whisp of American black charisma does something so obvious
that you wonder where he has been all these years. He recreates the guitar
rock of the seventies, but with an up-front commitment drawn from the caring
nineties.
So he is Hendrix and the Jacksons one minute; and a preacher man ('Thank God
for the music, not me') the next. The impact is greatest when he sings as if
his life depends upon it, and rips off all those guitar riffs long left
undisturbed in the vault. When he talks, in a surprisingly cultivated
'please love me' accent, the honey is laid on a bit thick. He even leads on
Bob Marley's mother to show off his 'keep the faith' credentials.
It makes for a totally absorbing show. I enjoyed the raunchier songs, like
'More than anything in this world', where he deals with safe pop platitudes
about 'lurve', better than the communal chant of 'Let love rule', but
personality cannot come in small doses. Kravitz, backed by a red blooded
West Coast bands, was a revelation; catch him.

After all the work to bring us pictures of eastern Europe after Marxism, the

attractive. In Open Space (7.40 BBC2) he explains how the Czechs can now
afford to buy only a twentieth of the country's property, and how the new
Skoda, being developed with Volkswagen, is too expensive to sell in its own
country. Horizon (8.10 BBC2) investigates the fatal virus diseases which
have emerged since the 1970s: is there a connection between Marbur disease,
Lassa fever, and Aids? Some American scientists are convinced there is a
common thread and are trying to find a means of control before the next
virus results in an epidemic.
The C4 series Watching The Detectives (9.00) goes to New York for a profile
of the city's 'toughest and most decorated ex-policeman turned private eye',
Bo Dietl. For Panorama (9.30 BBC1) Tom Mangold has spent three years
investigating '20 years of obsession and betrayal'. He tells the story of

FT  13 MAY 91 / Management: Food for thought
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The most seductive claim made by advocates of customer service - that it
promises huge pay-offs in terms of profitability - is also the most elusive
to measure.
As intuitively appealing as the relationship between service levels and
profits may be, the only data a manager has is usually the 'hard' data
concerning costs. Decisions about the level of quality to build into a given
package - including product, service and value - have been largely based on
those figures and, as Harvey Shycon, a consultant with Arthur D Little,
notes, 'hunches'*.
Shycon defines customer service as part of a total package comprising three
elements: the product itself, the service that comes with it, and,
inextricably linked with these two, value. The pay-off is defined as the
incremental profit received - both from increased market share, sales and
revenues as from reduced costs - as a result of better service.
He claims that Little has developed a way of measuring both the costs and
revenues of different levels of service which allows companies to design a
total quality package to optimise return on investment.
During the course of its work for a large food products company, which had a
US market share of 38 per cent, Little found that the company had a 41 per
cent share of a customer's business. This compared with 32 per cent for its
nearest competitor, and its higher share appeared to be linked to the
greater frequency of deliveries.
More frequent deliveries was good for this customer, a large regional food
chain; it reduced inventory, labour costs and improved the freshness of the
products it sold. For the food products company, it meant a higher cost of
service, but improved margins and volume of sales. This translated into an 8
per cent increase in sales volume and an almost 15 per cent improvement in
profit.
There appears to be proven benefits in the case of this customer, but would
the same level of benefits apply nationally? Little set out to determine the
value to the customer of specific service elements provided by the
manufacturer.
'By comparing those service elements with the service packages provided by
major competitors and determining how the customer spilt its purchases among
several suppliers, we could determine how the customer valued the total
service package in all its aspects and what level of service the customer
was willing to pay,' Shycon said.
The study suggested that the behaviour of the regional food retailer - that
more frequent deliveries would induce it to pay higher prices and increase
purchases from the company - was common to all food retailers. Detailed
statistical work was done to determine more precisely the value to the
customer of each element in the service package.
The bottom line? Two additional market share points nationwide boosted
revenues by Dollars 15.8m a year, of which Dollars 4.75m was additional
profit.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Management: In pursuit of repeat business - Simon Holberton
concludes his series on Total Quality Management by stressing the importance
of customer service and assesses Rank Xerox's attempts to achieve it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few phrases have seized the corporate imagination more in recent years than
'customer service'.
Honoured, perhaps, more in the breach than the observance, serving customers
better has been elevated to the top of many lists of top corporate
priorities for the 1990s.
Customer service - which is a way of life in Japan and, to a lesser extent,
the US - is often confused in Britain with servility. It should not be.
Customer service is the hard-headed pursuit of market share by winning the
loyalty of customers.
Serving customers better, Total Quality Management theorists and
practitioners maintain, is the proven path to increased profitability. They
cite studies which show that well served customers are more likely to make
repeat purchases of goods and services than those who are not.
Throughout the 1980s, customer service as a concept has broadened; TQM
proponents applied it to the internal operations of an organisation as well.
Like many management ideas, this is a self-evident proposition but a
powerful one, nevertheless. Loyal, or repeat, customers can have a
significant effect on a company's profitability. Studies show that they not
only tend to spend more over time, but that they are also more
cost-effective. This is because the costs of customer acquisition -
marketing and advertising - can be spread over time.
There are other benefits. A satisfied customer may tell up to eight others
of the good service he has received; a dissatisfied customer may tell up to
15 others. As a study published last year by Bain &amp; Co, a management
consultancy, noted, 'just avoiding this negative publicity has value' -
although quantifying it precisely is not possible.
For the past six years Xerox, the office equipment manufacturer, has been
trying to live up to its goal of making customer satisfaction its top
business priority. It has found that the pursuit of this goal has led it to
reconsider its organisational structure and the way it remunerates its
employees. The former is designed to place the whole capabilities of the
company - especially the service side of its business - closer to the
customer, while the latter aims to reinforce its rhetoric with real
financial advantages to employees.
In Britain, Rank Xerox's way of getting closer to the customer has been to
divide the country into five regions and bring together sales, service and
administration.
In the words of one recent management presentation to staff: '(The regions)
must exercise local, pro-active, situational decision-making in order to be
truly responsive to our customers.' It added that, in a business where the
office equipment market is fast becoming a commodity market, 'customer
service, support and application capabilities are now the key factors that
influence customer buying decisions'.
Those buying decisions, says Rob Walker, director of quality and management
systems for Rank Xerox UK, can be worth a lot of money. Last year, customers
discontinued using 5,500 Xerox machines out of about 140,000 installed. If
Rank Xerox had retained them all, the impact on its bottom line profit would
have been an extra Dollars 8.5m in 1990, and, over three years, an extra
Dollars 30m.
'If you then add in the opportunity cost the effect on the bottom line is
large,' says Walker. 'Not all of this is, however, controllable and
recoverable. But we reckon that 30 per cent of it is. So the financial
impact of dissatisfied customers is large.'
Rank Xerox spends a lot of time trying to understand its customers,
especially the dissatisfied ones. At present the company estimates that 7
per cent of its customer base is dissatisfied, and it is aiming to reduce
that level of dissatisfaction to zero by 1993.
It attempts to measure the level of customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction
through the responses it receives to two surveys conducted for it by an
independent market researcher. The first is an annual survey, sent out to
more than 130,000 customers. Last year, this survey had a 39 per cent return
rate. 'We take the dissatisfied responses and try to determine the root
causes for the dissatisfaction,' says Walker.
The second is a questionnaire sent out 90 days after a Xerox machine has
been purchased. (Before that the purchaser should have been called by a
customer care officer, and the salesperson responsible for the account
should also have made a call to see that everything is functioning
correctly.) A 'vulnerable' report is completed which highlights dissatisfied
customers. These are acted upon by people in the regions, who meet, decide
an action plan, and agree with the customer what needs to be done to remedy
the problem.
The nature of the complaints is also analysed to see if there are any
generic problems with equipment or service delivery. Walker says the company
has set up three cross-functional teams - comprising people from sales,
service and administration, management and non-management from all levels
throughout the organisation - to look at reliability, the order-to-install
life-cycle, and response time. Their job is to improve the process.
Surveys, teams and analysis may be a rational way of understanding customer
satisfaction/dissatisfaction and alerting management to problem areas, but
senior management at Xerox soon discovered, in the words of Vernon Zelmer,
managing director of Rank Xerox, that 'it is hard to distinguish customer
satisfaction from employee satisfaction. You can't have one without the
other.'
'Without happy and satisfied employees, who believe in what they do and who
can see the managers 'walk as they talk', then the message will fall on
stony ground.'
For the past two years, therefore, Rank Xerox has been working on employee
satisfaction. This has involved work on role clarification (understanding
what the job is); employee involvement (being involved in the job
specification); training; reward and recognition; and measurement.
One of the more intriguing aspects of this has been the decision to tie a
percentage of all Rank Xerox's 4,000 UK employees' pay to the achievement of
customer satisfaction targets. The percentage of pay affected by this
increases as employees become more senior in the company. Directors have 30
per cent of the value of their package riding on attainment of pre-set
goals.
'We look for incremental improvements in customer satisfaction each year,'
says Walker. 'Last year we set ourselves a target of growth of 4 percentage
points for 1991. Xerox Europe has just told us they want it up by 6 points.'
He claims that the company works hard at not allowing managers to make
trade-offs between attaining customer satisfaction targets and ones relating
to purely functional and financial goals. 'If we deliver customer
satisfaction all the other things will follow,' he says. 'This is probably
the most difficult time since 1980/81 but we are still making investment in
customer satisfaction.'
Zelmer is convinced that tying part of his employees' pay to the attainment
of service goals is the right way to go and is working. He says there has
been a positive correlation with the introduction of the new pay scheme and
the company's market share in the UK.
Although he believes that customer satisfaction ought to have been Xerox's
prime aim from the moment it embarked on its quality drive - some 10 years
ago - he is certain that to have tied remuneration to customer satisfaction
goals would have been wrong. 'You can't do that until people have some
control over what they do,' he says.
Management evaluation has also changed. Zelmer subscribes to the view that
'experience shows that 90 per cent of the time it is management that's the
problem, not the people.'
Xerox, among other companies, has introduced a form of assessment where the
managed evaluate the managers. Known as the 'management practice survey',
employees are asked to rate their manager. The results are anonymous and the
manager sits down with his staff and goes through them.
Yet this survey, and others, have shown up the gulf that still exists
between the aspirations of people who work at Rank Xerox and the reality of
working there. As Walker notes, the four things that employees most value -
fairness and respect, reward and recognition, career opportunities, and pay
 -are the things managers are least successful at delivering.
'We are trying to understand what the employees are saying to us and the
role of management in motivating them,' he says. 'We want the role of
manager to change from director to teacher and counsellor. But we still have
a long way to go; you don't change behaviour overnight. Employees have to
see senior managers behave in the appropriate way. It's difficult; it's the
next big leap for us.'
Though Walker maintains that people are always capable of stepping outside
the boundaries of their jobs/responsibil-ities they will do so only if they
are given support. 'They won't if you step on them the first time they do
it.'
And that is a real challenge for management. While senior managers accept,
intellectually, the new style and behaviour the company wants them to
exhibit, '60 per cent of them got to where they are under the old style,' he
says.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Construction Contracts: Newspaper production facility
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The south west regional office of BOVIS CONSTRUCTION in Bristol has been
awarded a Pounds 14.5m management contract by The Western Morning News Co,
part of the Northcliffe newspaper group, to build its new 12,675 sq metre
headquarters at Derriford, in Plymouth, 4.5 miles north of the city centre.
Bovis Construction, a P&amp;O company, will start work in June on the 64-week
project which will provide a combined printing plant, editorial and
administrative offices.
Designed by Nicholas Grimshaw &amp; Partners, the building, which has views of
Dartmoor and Plymouth Sound, resembles a grounded glass ship. Clad
completely in curved faceted glass walls, the entire printing operation will
be visible from the exterior.
The 'open' production areas are situated on two levels and will house the
operations of both the evening and regional morning newspapers, providing
views through the illuminated press hall.
As the building is cut into a hillside, pedestrian access will be directly
into level two. More than 4,500 sq metres of space will be provided in both
open plan and private offices built around a central atrium which will also
accommodate a reception area. The company boardroom will be situated in a
tower, which resembles a ship's bridge, standing 22 metres above the main
building.
The main structure of the building is of in situ reinforced concrete with
flat slabs to office areas, ribbed slabs to production areas and circular
columns extending through all floors to support the steel standard section
cambered roof beams.
The north and south external elevations will feature faceted glass walls.
Cambered roof beams will be supported by fabricated 'tusk' columns. The
glass panel system used will comprise fixed cast steel glazing arms and
struts which will be secured to the concrete columns.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Rowntree Mackintosh offers 37-hour
week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROWNTREE MACKINTOSH has offered food process workers a 37-hour week
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one of the most significant concessions on shorter hours outside the
engineering and water industries.
The offer provides a fillip for the campaign by UK unions to reduce working
hours. The success of engineering unions in winning 37-hour deals in plants
throughout the country has so far failed to spread significantly to other
industries.
Rowntree's offer, presaged at the start of the year when the company invited
union leaders for talks on hours, was made last week during pay
negotiations.
The company proposed a 9 per cent pay deal and said it was prepared to
reduce the 39-hour week by an hour in November and another hour in May 1993,
subject to discussions at the company's plants.
Deals would have to be made at factories on how the hours reductions should
be arranged and on ways to limit the costs of the reductions, the company
said.
Union leaders said they would be balloting immediately on the 9 per cent
offer, which they expected would be accepted.
They believe there could be opposition to the hours proposal, however,
because of the conditions attached. These include a shortening of tea
breaks, one of the issues which caused controversy in negotiations in the
engineering industry.
Engineering unions claim that more than 500,000 of their members are covered
by agreements for reductions in the previous norm of 39-hour weeks. Some
water companies have also conceded hours.
Elsewhere unions are attaching shorter hours claims to almost every pay
submission, but with limited success. British Rail and British Gas have both
offered reduced hours, but on terms that have so far proved unacceptable to
the unions.
Rowntree's proposed deal appears more likely to be acceptable, even if hard
bargaining may be needed before implementation.
The company, part of Nestle, the Swiss foods group, employes 5,000 process
workers, although the offer does not cover those who work in Glasgow.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Fallout from 'WA Inc' damages Labor: An inquiry in Perth has
heard allegations of a web of deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JOKE is going round Australia's eastern states about a frog who asks a
Western Australian girl for a kiss, claiming it will restore him to human
shape and bring back his fortune. The girl is about to oblige, but her
sister grabs the frog, puts it in a jar, and closes the lid. 'Why did you do
that?' asks the girl. 'Don't be silly,' says the sister, 'everyone knows a
talking frog is worth more than a Perth entrepreneur'.
The story illustrates the disdain with which Western Australia (WA) is
viewed among the eastern establishment following the collapse of
high-profile entrepreneurs like Mr Alan Bond and Mr Laurie Connell.
But if early indications from an inquiry now sitting in Perth are
substantiated, it may turn out that self-respect is the least of WA's losses
from a period when critics claim the state abandoned many of the standards
which are essential for efficient government.
The fallout will almost certainly lead to the ejection of the state Labor
government after a decade in power, and will damage the re-election
prospects of Mr Bob Hawke's federal Labor government, which will suffer by
association.
For much of the 1980s, Perth was the get-rich-quick capital of Australia, an
easy-money town where entrepreneurs like Mr Bond and Mr Robert Holmes a
Court built business empires which shook boardrooms on three continents.
But as the entrepreneurs succumbed to their mountainous debts, details
emerged of what is alleged to be a web of deals between government and local
businessmen, known collectively as 'WA Inc', which the Liberal opposition
claims has cost taxpayers more than ADollars 1bn (Pounds 833m).
'WA Inc' is being investigated by a Royal Commission, due to report in
January, which has already heard evidence of alleged undeclared donations to
Labor funds, illicit bank accounts used to finance propaganda, and envelopes
stuffed with money kept in ministers' offices. One witness said dealing with
Labor was like dealing with the Mafia.
Later, the inquiry will investigate deals involving government share
dealings, financial guarantees, and investments in companies and projects
associated with well-known entrepreneurs.
There are also allegations of illegal wire-tapping, improper land and
property dealings, and less than enthusiastic investigation of complaints by
the state police. Two deals carried out by Liberal governments in the early
1980s will also be investigated.
The key figure in the inquiry is Mr Brian Burke, WA's Labor premier from
1983 to 1988, when he became Australian ambassador to Ireland and the
Vatican - a post from which he resigned last month after beginning his
evidence to the commission.
Mr Burke denies any impropriety, and maintains that the commission will
clear his name. However, it is clear that his government had a close
relationship with local businessmen.
Under Mr Burke's leadership, the state took an active role in promoting
projects through direct investment or share dealing by government-owned
institutions. Among the most costly were a ADollars 150m investment in
Rothwells, Mr Connell's failed merchant bank, and losses of more than
ADollars 300m on a series of deals relating to a proposed petrochemical
complex which was never built.
Mr Burke, a charismatic former television journalist, was easily able to
overcome opposition within his own party - as the first Labor premier for a
decade he was seen as a messiah who had led the party out of the wilderness.
But evidence is growing that the implementation of government policies owed
as much to the Australian phenomenon of 'mateship', or cronyism, as to
political dynamism.
Witnesses who have yet to give evidence before the inquiry allege several
public service heads of department were removed or shifted to non-jobs to
make way for 'mates' of Mr Burke who were politically sympathetic.
'It was not enough to be neutral; it was not enough to be an able public
servant. They wanted people who were on their side,' one displaced official
claimed.
Mr Barry MacKinnon, the state Liberal leader, says many of the appointees
were 'compliant but not qualified', and blames much of the subsequent
disaster on their inability to manage or give dispassionate advice.
Others, like Mr Lyndon Rowe, director of the WA Confederation of Industry,
say the 'mateship' syndrome is an inevitable consequence of life in a small
town of around 1m people, even if it is the capital of a state the size of
western Europe.
But it is a phenomenon from which Labor appears unwilling to distance
itself. Dr Ian Alexander, a state MP who left Labor partly because of 'WA
Inc', says his efforts to persuade the party to condemn the Burke
government's activities were repeatedly rebuffed.
'It is not the done thing to dump on your mates. That is part of the
Australian tradition, and that is fine, but when people have been found to
have acted in this way, somebody at the top needs to make clear that they
cannot do so with impunity,' he says.
Dr Carmen Lawrence, the premier, refuses to condemn the Burke government, in
spite of the judgment of most political analysts that only that step can
save her government from a huge defeat at the polls. Dr Lawrence concedes
that the steady drip of disclosures from the commission is damaging Labor,
but says it is 'important to be loyal to the tenets of the party'.
Her strategy seems to be to hang on to office in the hope that the
commission will also damage the Liberal opposition, or that the voters' mood
will have changed by polling day in two years' time. The danger is that
whichever party wins the next election, the legitimacy of government in WA
may have been damaged so deeply that it will take years to recover.
As Mr Rowe puts it: 'The real cost of this whole exercise is not the money
that has been lost, it is the added cynicism in the electorate about the
political process, which in Australia does not have a high reputation at the
best of times'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE head of Brazil's privatisation programme has been persuaded by President
Fernando Collor de Mello to withdraw his resignation to prevent further
delays to already much-postponed state sell-offs.
Mr Eduardo Modiano, president of the National Development Bank and the
Privatisation Commission, had presented his resignation on Thursday along
with some 50 government officials, following the departure of the economy
minister, Ms Zelia Cardoso de Mello.
However, after meeting Mr Collor on Saturday, Mr Modiano agreed to stay,
explaining later: 'The privatisation programme would suffer a loss of
continuity with a change of command at this moment.' He added that Ms
Cardoso had encouraged all those of her team 'whose programmes had not yet
borne fruit' to stay. Mr Modiano and Mr Joao Santana, the new infrastructure
minister, are the only members of the original economic team to stay on.
The privatisation programme, initially scheduled to start last June, is now
expected to be given a boost. Mr Marcilio Moreira, the new economy minister,
has cited it as one of his priorities and according to Mr Modiano the
prospectus for the first sale, that of the steel company Usiminas, will be
agreed on this week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEPALESE voters went to the polls yesterday in this nation's first
multi-party elections in 32 years, the outcome of which will determine the
future of democracy in the tiny Himalayan Hindu kingdom.
The Nepali Congress party, a centrist group backed by India, was the
favourite going into the polls. But many observers believe no single party
will muster an absolute majority. This would force the Congress party
leaders to join the smaller parties, the Communists or the National
Democratic parties, representing royalist interests, in a coalition
government.
There was a 60 per cent turnout at the polls, according to the Nepal
Election Commission. Voters chose 205 MPs from among 1,345 candidates,
representing 20 political parties, including 219 independent candidates.
Twenty-five people were injured in election-related violence, the commission
said. Police and soldiers were deployed throughout the country and the army
reportedly fired shots over the crowd at two centres. Two ballot boxes were
stolen in the Pyuthan district in mid-western Nepal, the sole constituency
where the election is to be re-held.
The Congress party and the Communist (United Marxist-Leninist) party were
both seeking seats in the election. The two had joined forces just over a
year ago in a popular revolt against Nepal's monarch, King Birendra Bir
Bikram Shah Dev. That uprising resulted in a new constitution and the
promise of a multi-party political system. Since then the Congress party and
the Communists have ruled Nepal jointly through an interim cabinet led by
prime minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai of the Congress party.
Preliminary results were to be announced by this morning.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Italy's discount rate cut after budget agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY yesterday cut its discount rate by one point to 11.5 per cent. This
followed agreement by the cabinet on Saturday to a budget package worth
L14,200bn (Pounds 6.5bn) to bring the deficit back into line with this
year's L132,000bn target.
The moves marked the end of a tense week for Mr Giulio Andreotti's new
government, in which it appeared to be in danger of a renewed crisis and
possibly early elections.
Saturday's mini-budget, which represents a compromise between calls for
tough spending curbs and demands to protect public expenditure, has put off
that risk, at least for the time being.
The new measures will partly satisfy the treasury minister, Mr Guido Carli,
who reportedly threatened to resign if his spending cuts were not accepted.
Mr Carli has also won agreement on preparing for the part-privatisation of
various state enterprises.
The cabinet agreed small rises in employee pension contributions, and
tensions between the coalition parties could return in days given the
decision to prepare a draft pensions reform law by June 15.
Both trade unions and the Democratic Party of the Left (the former
Communists) criticised the increases in pension contribution.
The Socialists, who had argued that changes to the pension system were not
part of the policy package agreed by the coalition parties last month, will
have been pleased with the discount rate cut.
Some L7,100bn is to be saved this year by reducing turnover among
public-sector employees and spending freezes. Meanwhile, a similar amount
will be raised by additional indirect taxes and levies, including charges on
portable telephones and credit cards.
Italy's leading businessmen have criticised the budgetary measures as being
insufficient and weighted too heavily towards revenue raising rather than
spending cuts. However, the discount rate cut, which will help reduce
inflation and lower the government's borrowing costs, has met with approval.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Ministers unworried by idea of two-speed Emu: EC
representatives start to look at the realities of economic and monetary
union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The prospect of a two-speed monetary union was raised - and no one was
shocked,' said Luxembourg's finance minister, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, after
he finished chairing an informal meeting on Saturday of EC finance
ministers.
This indeed was the weekend - at the probable half-way point in the EC's
negotiations on economic and monetary union (Emu) - that realities of
various kinds set in:
The reality that there has been far more talk than action in getting the
Twelve's economies to converge on sound budgetary principles.
The reality that, even with crash adjustment programmes in weaker EC
economies, the Twelve will not be able by the late 1990s to move in perfect
unison to a single currency.
The reality that there is little practical difference in granting a grace
period to a country (Britain) which is for the moment politically unwilling
to join Emu and granting one to countries which are economically unable to
do so for a while.
The reality that Germany has monetary might, and perhaps right, on its side
in arguing against setting up a fully-fledged European Central Bank until it
has a real job (running a single currency) to do.
Mr Jacques Delors said Saturday's meeting was 'the best discussion we have
ever had on convergence'. He was referring to the general endorsement that
ministers gave to the idea that the Community should soon start designing
specific 'adjustment' plans for countries with chronic spending deficits
and/or double digit inflation. The EC's monetary committee has suggested
three candidates - Italy, Greece and Portugal - for adjustment programmes.
Mr Delors played down this innovation, noting that Greece had already
submitted itself to EC scrutiny in return for an EC balance of payments
loan, while Portugal and Ireland had called on Brussels for technical help
in setting budget policy.
But introducing specific EC surveillance, well before the planned 1994 start
of the formal Emu transition phase, and extending it to all Twelve (as
France and Spain suggested), is sure to stir controversy. Mr Norman Lamont,
the UK chancellor of the exchequer, said that, even after 1994, the
necessary deficit-pruning and anti-inflation measures should be left to
individual governments.
As a form of monetary convergence, Mr Anders Rasmussen, the Danish finance
minister, suggested that from 1994 on, the fluctuations in the narrow EMS
band should be reduced from 2.25 to 1.5 per cent, and that in 1996 the wider
6 per cent band (within which sterling and the peseta currently gyrate)
should disappear altogether.
But for all such adjustment programmes, ministers generally recognised that
a two- or multi-speed move to Emu was inevitable, a forecast that many of
them and Mr Delors himself had earlier decried when it came from the lips of
Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president.
It was important to 'de-mystify' a two-speed Emu, Mr Delors said. The
likelihood, he said, was that a majority of countries would assume the Ecu
as their single currency in the late 1990s, and that those countries staying
outside the Emu for a time would have their currencies linked to the Ecu, by
something similar to today's European Monetary System.
After Saturday's meeting, the Commission president refused to elaborate on
his idea, hinting indeed that he might have been precipitate in raising it
so long before the expected wrap-up of Emu negotiations in the autumn.
Signalling clearly the likelihood that the UK would sign the Emu treaty
could still cause the Major government problems with diehard anti-EC Tories
in the run-up to the UK general election that could also come this autumn.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, echoed Mr Delors, saying:
'The treaty must be written so that it does not pre-empt a UK decision,
while at the same time allowing the Emu process to go ahead.' Mr Philippe
Maystadt, finance minister of Belgium, which like France wants fast movement
to Emu, described as the Delors idea as interesting.
But Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, said he thought 'it
could create more problems that it would solve'. He appeared to worry that
if the UK got its let-out clause, it would leave Spain more isolated in the
negotiations. For economic reasons, Spain wants a relatively lengthy
transition to Emu, but for political reasons does not want to be lumped with
the likes of Greece in getting a special grace period.
On the vexed issue of when the European Central Bank (ECB) should be set up,
Mr Beregovoy sought to smooth over differences with Germany, with his
officials talking only of an institution 'pre-figuring' the ECB being set up
in 1994. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, remained as firm as
ever in insisting that the ECB should only be established on the eve of a
single currency, and that calling any lesser institution the ECB would be
dangerously misleading. 'Wrong labels can lead to wrong behaviour,' Mr
Waigel said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl received a further blow to his political
prestige at the weekend when the unfavourable result of an opinion poll
prompted opposition calls for an early election.
The poll by the Emnid institute, published in Der Spiegel, the weekly news
magazine, indicated that if a general election had been held on Sunday, the
ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) would have received only 38 per cent of the
votes, 6 points less than in December's first all-German vote.
The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) improved sharply from 34 per cent to
40 per cent. Mr Hans-Jochen Vogel, the SPD's chairman, said Mr Kohl should
call a new election to end internal government squabbling and deal with the
problems in east Germany.
Germany's current account fell further into deficit in March, mainly through
payments to finance the Gulf war. The DM5.3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) deficit was the
largest ever for one month. It compared with one of DM1.5bn in February this
year and a surplus of DM10.4bn in March, 1990.
The surplus totalled DM2.8bn, against DM2.6bn in February and DM13.8bn in
March last year. Exports were down by 13 per cent and imports 5.4 per cent
higher.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Luxembourg presidency of the EC is to try next month for an agreement by
11 Community states on a minimum standard rate of value added tax, leaving
the UK alone in its opposition to any EC regulation of fiscal rates.
A discussion in Luxembourg on Saturday by EC finance ministers on how to
bring indirect tax rates closer together, in advance of the planned removal
of tax checks at internal EC borders in 1993, revealed a three-way split.
Luxembourg had only Spain's backing for its proposal of a 14 per cent
minimum standard VAT rate, while nine governments indicated their desire for
a 16 per cent minimum.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, said Britain believed
indirect tax rates should be market-driven, and it would oppose any EC tax
proposals, all of which require unanimity to pass.
Mr Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg said his country, with its
traditionally low indirect tax rates, had some sympathy with the UK
argument, but wanted to use the last month of its presidency to get some
agreement on the issue.
Approximation is already, in fact, happening with low-rate countries such as
Luxembourg and Germany raising their VAT rates, and higher-rate countries
like France, Belgium and Ireland lowering theirs. But this process is not
going fast enough for others to contemplate abolishing all cross-border tax
checks in less than two years without fear of trade distortions.
Other proposals to be tackled by finance ministers on June 3 include reduced
VAT rates for necessities, and minimum excise rates on petrol, tobacco and
alcohol.

FT  13 MAY 91 / East German wage rises criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DISRUPTIVE migration of east Germans into west Germany is likely to be
spurred rather than lessened by high wage rises east of the Elbe, according
to a study conducted by US economists.
The report, from the University of California at Berkeley, is critical of
the sharp rise in wages in east Germany since unification got under way last
year. By accentuating the cost squeeze on already uncompetitive east German
companies, the rise of 42 per cent in nominal wages in the first 10 months
of last year has contributed to mass unemployment and short-time working.
After extensive analysis and field work in east Germany, the study calls the
economic collapse there 'one of the worst and sharpest depressions in
European history'.
Opinion surveys carried out for the team in east Germany challenge the
conventional German wisdom on the reasons for east-west migration. Both the
government and trade unions maintain that wage differentials between east
and west need to be reduced to ease the danger of a further influx westwards
of east Germans.
Nominal east German wages are only about 50 per cent of west German levels.
A number of recent pay deals envisage equalising pay rates by 1994.
'We found that few workers will migrate for higher western wages. Most
prefer to work in the east in spite of the wage differential, and are
prepared to wait there for new jobs to appear if they become unemployed,'
says the report, which will appear in the spring issue of Brookings Papers
on Economic Activity. It concludes: 'Higher wages (in east Germany) will
cause more migration by increasing unemployment than they will deter by
closing the wage gap.'
The report recommends that the Bonn government pay a wage subsidy or
'employment bonuses' to all private sector companies hiring in the east.
Last year's wage rises were in contrast to a 50 per cent reduction in
industrial output and in the prices of manufactured goods in east Germany
after the introduction of the D-Mark on July 1 1990.
The report says the suggested wage subsidy could be as high as 75 per cent
of a worker's wage. The scheme would more or less pay for itself as it would
foster economic activity by increasing profitability and investments.
Expenditure on the subsidy would be offset by additional state income from
tax and social security contributions, reductions in unemployment benefit
payments, and by enhancing the value of privatised companies.
Although criticism of high wage levels has also been made by German
economists and, increasingly, the government, the US economists are the
first to offer a detailed solution to the problem.
They say their proposed wage subsidy would make a crucial difference to the
survival prospects of most east German companies. After currency union last
year, they estimate, only 8 per cent of the east German labour force worked
in companies which earned sufficient revenue to cover short-term costs.
The fundamental problem hindering privatisation of east German companies is
that most of them have negative value, since their costs exceed revenue in
the absence of great productivity improvements.

<TEXT>
The Soviet parliament approved an experiment for 'contract', or volunteer
sailors, in a move seen as the first tentative step to transforming the vast
Soviet armed services from a conscript to a professional force.
The Supreme Soviet also approved a cut in naval service from three to two
years, bringing it into line with the army. 'A professional army is born,'
said Supreme Soviet speaker Anatoly Lukyanov. US team to advise on Soviet

Meanwhile, Armenian Prime Minister Vazgen Manukyan said large-scale Soviet
army raids on villages in the southern republic had practically stopped but
again voiced fears that Moscow could enforce an economic blockade.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (10): A three-way strategy - Professional
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OF Cardiff's striking new office buildings are occupied by the city's
leading accountants, solicitors and architects - visual evidence of
prosperity and growth in the mid and late 1980s, when annual fee income rose
between by 30 and 50 per cent each year.
However, the economic downturn has now reached the city professions, albeit
in a mild form.
Hywel G Jones, South Wales senior partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the
UK's largest accountancy firm, points out that it would have been
unrealistic to expect the growth rates to continue at such levels:
'We were seeing growth rates in our firm of between 40 per cent and 50 per
cent a year. It was obviously not going to continue at that level. I do not
think the professions will have it as good in the next 10 years as they have
in the past 10.'
But most large professional firms expect growth rates in fee income this
year of between 10 per cent to 15 per cent.
The smaller professional practices, concentrating on private-client and
domestic work, have been hit hardest. The larger firms still have the
benefits of Cardiff's dominance of service provision in South Wales, the
work from inward investment projects, strong working relationships between
the public and private sectors, and efficient networking facilities.
The gap is widening between the large firms and the rest. Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte, Peat Marwick, Touche Ross, Ernst &amp; Young, and Price Waterhouse all
have substantial offices in Cardiff with national and international work as
well as local. Most is generated, rather than referred from other practices
in their networks.
Professional polarisation has also had an impact on architects. Firms such
as Hoggett Lock-Necrews get about 40 per cent of their work from outside
Wales.
The only profession not to see polarisation is the Bar, which is not
organised on partnership or firm lines. The four sets of chambers operating
from Cardiff are still expanding, but commercial solicitors tend to instruct
barristers from specialised commercial chambers in London.
Mr Robert Ellis, the partner in charge of accountants Touche Ross, points
out that professional services in Cardiff have increased continuously in
expertise, and that clients who 10 years ago would have automatically gone
to London for advice now seek professional services in Cardiff.
Three common factors have emerged in the way the professions are coping with
the present situation, and their plans for the 1990s. These are: to widen
the markets they serve on a geographical basis; to deepen the level of
specialties they offer; and to build up links with practices in other
European Community and overseas countries.
The first means, in effect, that firms are competing not only in the local
market but nationally. All the city's leading firms judge themselves by City
of London standards, and believe that, apart from projects involving large
numbers of people or very specialised functions, they can compete in quality
and price.
Professional fees in Cardiff are considerably lower than in London. The
hourly rates of the leading Cardiff solicitors are between one third and a
half of those of top City solicitors. The accountants have a price
differential of around a third less than London.
Cardiff's lawyers and accountants are seeking to exploit this by combining
it with niche products and geographical access. Phillips &amp; Buck, with 22
partners and 100 lawyers, has joined the Eversheds network to gain access to
a national spread of offices.
Mr David Vokes, managing partner, says this trend of increasing the
geographical access (both nationally and through association with other
European Community practices) fits in with the move to growing
specialisation.
'We are in the business of solving clients' problems. While most of our
business is based in South Wales, we are able to call on resources
elsewhere. This provides flexibility.' he said.
A speciality where Cardiff firms have a competitive edge nationally is
professional advice on inward investment. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, for
example, has built up a centre of excellence in work of this kind, and most
major projects are now referred to the Cardiff office by the group's other
UK practices.
The second thrust of the strategy is to widen and deepen the levels of
specialisation on offer. Huw Williams is a partner at Edwards Geldard, the
law firm, and is in charge of the its work for the Cardiff Bay Development
Corporation. He is a specialist in planning and environmental law.
'In the past, the legal work on the Bay would have gone straight to London,'
he said. 'I think that what we have proved is a speedy response of
specialised units which are based locally. Specialisation is the key to
success, and that is what we have been concentrating on.'.
The accountants have been at the forefront of the move to greater
specialisation with the Cardiff majors providing a full range of financial,
corporate and management consulting services. Hugh Thomas is the partner in
charge at Price Waterhouse and a strong proponent of accountants becoming
more involved with clients. 'I think we feel we are contributing more and as
Wales becomes more entrepreneurial, there is a need for wider and wider
advice,' he said.
One example of this is the computer consulting business established by Ernst
&amp; Young in Cardiff. Ieuan Griffiths, the senior manager in charge, believes
such services are now a crucial part of the overall package on offer: 'We
can start from scratch and go straight through with the client in
implementing strategy. Projects in some cases last a few months, in others
more than two years.'
The third part of the strategy and the most difficult to assess is the
development of links with professional practices in other Community
countries. The accountants have had a head start with their existing
international links and the law firms have concentrated on developing
relationships on non exclusive terms with continental law practices.
Cardiff's professions have promoted awareness of the European single market
in a vigorous fashion. Today, for example, Edwards Geldard and Ernst &amp; Young
host a seminar on business in Europe - appropriate in a city where two of
the main roads are named after Nantes and Stuttgart, Cardiff's twin cities.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (11): Reaching for the stars - Stewart
Dalby asks whether more hotels are needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE face of it, Cardiff seems to have plenty of hotels.
If you emerge from Central station and look skywards slightly to the right,
your eyes are met by the masthead of the Holiday Inn (182 rooms). It is
unusual to see a Holiday Inn in a British city centre: they tend to be built
on the periphery of towns, close to motorways.
Two hundred yards from the Holiday Inn, past the ice rink, is the
International Hotel (143 rooms), built by Brent Walker at a cost of Pounds
7.5m, and opened last September.
If, instead of crossing St Mary's Street to the Holiday Inn in Mill lane,
you turn left down St Mary's Street, you quickly come to the Royal Hotel (63
rooms). Continue past St David's Hall, and you come to the Angel Hotel (91
rooms). Situated between Cardiff Castle and the Arms Park rugby ground, the
Angel describes itself as the city's premier hotel.
Close by is the Park Hotel (119 rooms) and the Crest Hotel (157 rooms).
Farther out, near to the motorway, are the Post House (150 rooms) and the
Moat House (144 rooms).
All of these are three- or four-star hotels. Most could be described as new
'business' or old 'town' hotels. They all charge between Pounds 50 and
Pounds 80 a night.
If a couple of places not mentioned are included, the total number of
bedrooms in quality hotels is around 1,000 to 1200. If one were to include
two-star hotels, Cardiff probably has some 6,000 rooms available.
How much accommodation does a city need? Albeit a capital city, though one
which is not yet an established business-and-services centre, nor on the
well-mapped circuit for cultural and heritage tourists? For the moment, the
answer would seem to be: about what it has got.
The occupancy rate of the Holiday Inn, for example, is 70 per cent, spread
through the week. It is full of business people during weekdays, while
weekends are a moveable feast. If there happens to be a rugby international
at Cardiff Arms park, the hotel is full to overflowing; if there is not, it
can be empty.
According to Jack Nicholas, general manager of the Holiday Inn, a good
weekend trade was beginning to build in family tourists taking advantage of
heavily discounted room prices. But this was thwarted by the Gulf war and
the recession. The past few months have seen a decline in weekend bookings.
Most of Cardiff's other quality hotels probably have occupancy rates similar
to that of the Holiday Inn, though the International Hotel has an occupancy
rate of 50 per cent, being a new hotel still building up business.
If supply seems to be roughly in line with current demand, the situation
could soon change, even though a Copthorne hotel is being built, for Cardiff
has aspirations to become both an important business-and-services centre and
a cultural tourist city, in the manner of York, Chester or even Glasgow.
For most people, the transformation to a services or business city is linked
with the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. When the barrage is built
across the bay, Cardiff could become a maritime city with some 5m sq ft of
extra office space, many tourist and leisure facilities, and 30,000 new jobs
in buildings that will be put up on what is now largely derelict land. The
development corporation believes it will be 10 to 15 years before these
targets are realised.
Before then, other developments could ensure a greater demand for hotel
rooms. Opposite the International Hotel is the half-finished World Trade
Centre, being developed by Brent Walker. Technical problems have delayed its
completion. But with a city grant and a soft loan from the European
Investment Bank, it should now be finished by the middle of next year.
It will have exhibition space and conference facilities for 5,000 people.
Brent Walker also bought the ice rink in 1989. It has managed to change its
use designation (though it is home to a successful ice-hockey team, which
will continue to use it), and it can now be covered over and used, for
example, for rock concerts. It seats 4,000. Despite Brent Walker's well
publicised financial problems of the past year, these projects are
proceeding, and will mean a greater demand for hotel space.
So, too, may the efforts being made by Cardiff Marketing, a private company
supported by local councils and the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. The
thought underlying Cardiff Marketing's efforts is that, if Glasgow can be
publicised into life, then why not Cardiff? It is, after all, a capital city
with a rich cultural identity.
It is estimated that 2m visitors went to Cardiff last year, but fewer than
100,000 went to tourist centres for information. The potential is therefore
considerable. The city may even get a five-star hotel.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (12): Nothing at the top level, but still
a good choice - Restaurants / Anthony Moreton studies the menu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN DE Courcey's restaurant burnt to the ground last month, a pall darker
than the smoke from the fire hung over the business community. De Courcey's
had, within a very short time, become one of the favourite places in which
to talk shop.
The restaurant was the brain-child of Thilo and Pat Thielmann. He had been
manager of the Holiday Inn, and the two of them decided to open a top-drawer
restaurant, to which they eventually hoped to add a number of bedrooms, to
create the sort of restaurant with rooms that is so common in France.
The wooden building had an unusual history. It had been brought over from
Scandinavia in 1892, by a Nordic businessman who had settled in Cardiff and
wanted to live somewhere that reminded him of home. It was not only built of
wood, but the rooms were panelled. These the Thielmanns had carefully
restored, by stripping off layers of paint.
Within its short three-year life, the Thielmanns had turned the place, an
out-of-town restaurant deep in Cardiff's green belt, into one of the best
restaurants in Wales. In three hours in the early hours of an April morning,
the fire that consumed it left just the four brick chimney-stacks.
The Thielmanns will no doubt create another restaurant. In the meantime
diners, as well as business lunchers in Cardiff, are not starved for choice.
Good restaurants have grown with the city over the last decade, and if none
has reached the very top level Cardiff is not unique in this respect. It is
a curious fact that the Good Food Guide names 32 top-rated restaurants in
Britain, but only four in cities outside London - in Norwich, Plymouth
Bradford and Bristol.
One of the growing favourites in Cardiff is Trillium, which at first glance
looks like a club library whose back part changes into a conservatory. Welsh
Water's main Cardiff office is around the corner, and many of its
executives, including the chairman, Mr John Elfed Jones, are to be seen
there.
Slightly further out of the city centre is La Chaumiere, where Karen Duncan
and Rory Garvey took over some 18 months ago. The restaurant sits in the
shadow of Llandaff cathedral, but it gets rather more of its clientele from
the nearby BBC headquarters than from ecclesisatical patronage.
An innovative in-town restaurant is the Armless Dragon, where the
proprietor, David Richards, is also one of the two chefs. Although the basis
of the cuisine is European, there are touches of far-distant places and an
emphasis on pure foods. Diners include a good sprinkling of mandarins from
the Welsh Office.
One who has made a notable mark is Meirion Dally who, with his wife Ann, has
created a Welsh ambience at Blas ar Gymru, or A Taste of Wales. Wales has
never had a particularly strong tradition of native dishes, but the Dallys
have attempted to get as close to a Welsh cuisine as possible. They even
offer Welsh wine, produced just outside Cardiff.
The waiters and waitresses at Blas ar Gymru are dressed in traditional Welsh
outfits, including the stove-pipe hats, and the piped music is Welsh. Dishes
include laver bread (a processed seaweed), cockles, Welsh cakes and Lady
Llanover duck, a traditional Welsh way of preparing the bird.
Not far away, and in direct competition, is Yr Ystafell Gymreig - The Welsh
Room. Although the name is Welsh, the emphasis is more mainstream European
with fillet steak Lloyd George offered as a touch of Wales. It also has
laver bread on the menu.
Among ethnic places, the Indian Ocean is a transplant from the people who
gave London the Red Fort; and a recent Chinese addition is the Orient
Rendezvous, from which a dum sum could be dropped-kicked into the Arms Park,
the great rugby ground, across the road. In a previous incarnation, this
restaurant was called Spangherro's - after the famous French rugby forward.
Nearby is the Noble House, where lovers of Chinese are frequently serenaded
by a harpist.
The restaurant most characteristic of its homeland is Le Cassoulet, where
the emphasis is on the dishes of the south of France. Cassoulet Toulousain
is always on the menu, and is a must for those who want to savour the
flavours of Provence.
Two restaurants that have undergone something of a sea change are Gibsons
and Le Gourmet Enchante. Gibsons is the doyen of Cardiff dining places, its
chef-owner, Mrs Irene Caning, being virtually the first to bring innovative
French cuisine to the city. Le Gourmet Enchante was a more recent addition
in the same vein.
Both have, in the past few months, taken on a new identity, with new menus
placing them more firmly in the mainstream of French-style cooking. Gibsons
has changed into Quayles, with Mrs Caning still in charge; while Le Gourmet
Enchante is now merely Le Gourmet, and describes itself as a brasserie. For
music-lovers, the Celebrity restaurant, in the St David's Hall, offers not
just reasonably-priced food but an attractive wine list at tempting prices.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (9): Euro-flights may be spokes from a hub
 -The airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST BEFORE seven o'clock on the morning of April 8, a Jetstream 31, of Manx
Airways, took off from Cardiff-Wales airport, at Rhoose, 15 miles west of
the capital, with a full payload of 16 passengers.
One hundred minutes later, it touched down in Brussels, and a dream nurtured
for years within the Welsh business community had become reality.
Capt Norman Brewitt, the airline's chief pilot, who was at the controls, had
helped to introduce a service much needed in Cardiff - a direct link between
the Welsh capital and the de facto, if not de jure, capital of the European
Community.
Four hours after the Brussels flight, another Manx aircraft, a JE 103, took
off for Dusseldorf. The two flights represented a double first: the first
time Cardiff had been linked directly to these European cities, and the
first time Manx had run a continental service.
Mr Terry Liddiard, managing director of Manx, says the company wants to
create a hub of services from Cardiff: 'There is enormous potential in South
Wales, and we see it as a major centre for our services. We hope to bring in
a twice-daily Paris flight later this year, and introduce another service to
Manchester in the autumn.'
Manx already operates services from Cardiff to the Isle of Man (its home
base), Glasgow, the Channel Islands, Dublin and Belfast.
Cardiff is not without international flights. Air France introduced a Paris
service last year; and KLM, through one of its subsidiaries, has for some
years operated one to Amsterdam. The latter, like the Brussels flights,
provides a connecting point for passengers who want to fly on to other
destinations without having to use Heathrow or Gatwick.
There have been a number of attempts to bring intercontinental carriers into
the Welsh capital, but this has proved a difficult business to generate.
Airlines providing flights to Toronto, Florida and the Caribbean have come
and gone, to the dismay of the airport's director, Mr Graham Greaves. These
carriers have either been absorbed by bigger partners, or fallen into
financial difficulties.
But Mr Greaves promises: 'We shall have Toronto, and Orlando in Florida, on
the schedules this year - Toronto for the first time direct.' Nationair, the
Canadian airline, will serve Toronto with a Boeing 757, and the UK carrier
Monarch is also using a 757 on its North American operations.
The core of Mr Greaves' strategy, though, is to develop Cardiff as a
business centre for European destinations. 'We must try and generate more
scheduled flights,' he says. 'This is where our destiny lies.'
Businessmen in South Wales have for years bemoaned the lack of direct links
with European centres. Since Cardiff is one of the UK's three main centres
of government, they believe that Brussels, in particular, should be a big
earner, especially as civil servants need to travel there for meetings.
But the South Wales business community is not large, and it will need to use
the airport to the full if Manx's enterprise is to be justified.
The omens are not overwhelmingly favourable, however, despite the cries for
such a link. Air France, for instance, has not had great success with its
Paris service, launched last year, though this may have something to do with
the less-than-convenient time-slot.
Like most regional airports in Britain, Cardiff, until last year one of the
fastest-growing, must therefore continue to rely heavily on its charter
traffic for its immediate profitability.
'About 85 per cent of all our traffic is in the charter business,' says Mr
Greaves. 'That, inevitably, peaks between June and September; and so, to
utilise the airport's facilities more sensibly, we need to flatten that peak
by attracting out-of-season business.'
But Cardiff, again like other regional airports, has been hit by the
recession and the Gulf war. It also faces competition from Bristol which,
with a catchment area of some 4m people, compared with Cardiff's 2.5m, is in
a healthier position to attract holidaymakers bound for Spain, Greece and
the ski slopes.
Mr Greaves takes encouragement from what he detects as a change in holiday
patterns. 'Holidaymakers are looking to go further afield. They are looking
to the Caribbean and Florida, and this is where Cardiff has a distinct edge.
We have the second-best weather conditions of any British airport.' He also
considers that Cardiff's runway, extended four years ago, provides
advantages. 'Our 7,723ft runway can handle all the big giants - including
Concorde.'
Two years ago, a British Airways jumbo flew non-stop from Cardiff to Seattle
on America's west coast, with a full payload. And this winter some 30
aircraft landed at Cardiff on diversions from Heathrow and Gatwick. In the
summer, Concorde will take a party of Americans, holidaying in Europe, back
home from Cardiff.
When British Airways opens its giant maintenance plant alongside the
airport, five jumbos a month will be flown into the airport, to be handled
in the hangar - a welcome boost in landing fees.
Those fees helped to increase profitability to a record Pounds 1.9m in
1989-90, the last year for which figures are available. The figures will
tumble for the year just ended, given the difficult time experienced by
airlines and airports around the world.
But the Pounds 12m capital-spending programme is going ahead. Work begins
this summer on a lounge for international passengers, and better Customs
facilities will be provided. These should be ready by the end of next year.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (8): End of S4C contract trims HTV's
profits - Stewart Dalby tunes in to 'media city'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARDIFF HAS such a vibrant and diverse media scene that it has often been
termed 'media city' in its promotions.
Depending on where you are and how you set your aerial, it is possible to
receive seven different television channels or variants of channels.
Similarly, it is possible to tune in not only to Radio Wales but also to the
other five BBC stations, as well as a variety of commercial ones.
The city has its own morning, evening and Sunday newspapers - the morning
paper, the Western Mail, styling itself 'the national newspaper of Wales'.
Cardiff is also thought to have more independent television producers than
any city outside of London. If video companies and design concerns are
included, around 6,000 people are employed in the media industry, some 2,500
of them involved directly in broadcasting.
One reason why there is such life in the media sector is the Welsh language.
After the failure to get an assembly for Wales, in the late 1970s, a
public-service Welsh-speaking television station, S4C, was established in
1982-83. There was perceived to be a genuine need. Between a fifth and a
third of people in Wales speak Welsh.
Yet it was not just a question of language: there was a cultural identity to
be catered for. At the same time, non-Welsh-speaking people were
increasingly fed up with hours (often peak hours) of viewing time devoted to
programmes in a different language. The fourth channel was therefore a neat
political solution to a social and cultural problem.
The fact that Cardiff is a national capital, rather than just the centre of
a region, influences the printed media, too. John Humphries, editor of the
Western Mail, pursues what he calls a twin-track policy:
'We have to compete with all the London-based newspapers - notice I call
them London-based and not national newspapers - on international, political
and sports coverage. At the same time, we have to supply news about Wales,
in which there is great interest.'
News of Wales is editionised. The Western Mail has nine editions, regional
and otherwise. Two pages of news about Wales are changed each night.
The paper feels strongly about local issues. Recently it took David Hunt,
secretary of state for Wales, to task for failing to push through parliament
the private bill that would have allowed a barrage to be built across
Cardiff Bay.
The existence of S4C has meant that the two main television channels, BBC
Wales and HTV, have prospered, because, in a sense, they had a captive
market. S4C has a budget of about Pounds 44m and runs about 25 hours of
Welsh-language programmes which go out on Channel 4. Until recently, those
which were not produced by the BBC were largely made by HTV. The main
commercial channel had a five-year contract to make nine hours a week for
S4C.
Since the contract expired, however, S4C has turned more and more to the
growing band of independent producers.
Loss of revenue through the drop in demand from S4C has contributed to a
huge dent in HTV's pre-tax profits, though other factors have included: a
new exchequer levy imposed in January 1990, changes in the way programmes
are made, a poor advertising market, and competition from independent
producers in areas other than Welsh-language programmes.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended December 1990 were Pounds 5.3m on
turnover of Pounds 179m. A direct comparison is difficult, because of a
change in the year end; but for the five months that ended December 1989
they were Pounds 7.4m, and for the year ended July 1989, Pounds 14.5m.
Hard times have also resulted in severe staff cuts. Some 700 people are now
employed, compared with more than 1,000 two years ago
One way to improve profits might be to make more programmes for the national
network. But the domination of the network system by the big five commercial
companies (Central, Thames, London Weekend, Yorkshire and Granada), says
Mansel Jones, head of press and public relations at HTV, makes it difficult
for medium-sized commercial companies such as HTV to get a look in.
HTV faces further competition in that, by 1992, 25 per cent of output must
be made by independent producers. But before then - this month, in fact - it
faces a stiff challenge when its licence comes up for renewal. The new round
of franchises, which will be partly determined by sealed cash bids, is
considered unfair at HTV.
Mr Jones has compared them to a 'blind crap shoot'. There is a feeling at
HTV that the expertise in making programmes for Wales should count for
something more than cash in an envelope when the bids are sorted.
BBC Wales, too, has been experiencing upheavals. As part of the Funding the
Future exercise, which requires the BBC as a whole to save Pounds 75m by
1993, it is looking for savings of Pounds 2m and the loss or contracting out
of 300 jobs. It, too, has to commission 25 per cent of its output from
independents by 1992.
With this shake-up under way, Geraint Talfan Davies, controller of BBC
Wales, sees the challenge of the future as making more English-speaking
programmes, not just for Wales but also for the national network. Recently,
BBC Wales announced that it would, for the first time, appoint a
non-Welsh-speaker to a top programme post.
BBC Radio Wales already has a substantial number of its programmes
networked: last year, it had 306 hours broadcast on other BBC stations.
Gaynor Shutte, the new editor of BBC Wales, wants to increase this
substantially, not just because it is lucrative, but because it keeps up
standards.
In contrast, BBC Television Wales networked only 20 hours last year, partly
because of its Welsh-language obligations. (BBC Scotland networked 160 hours
of its programmes). But Geraint Talfan Davies hopes the number of networked
hours will reach three figures in the next few years.

MOTORISTS faced with delays due to road-widening schemes may at some stage
in the future give thanks for the day when Ron Brindle, a civil engineer,
walked into the University of Wales College of Cardiff.
Mr Brindle came in with an idea which, developed in conjunction with the
university college, has led to a soil-nailing machine which can drastically
reduce the amount of time it takes to widen roads.
The machine, which uses high air-pressure to fire nails into the soil at
200mph, has been patented and developed; and licencing arrangements have
been made worldwide.
The University of Wales College of Cardiff (UWCC) became involved through
its commercial consulting arm, and a licence was given to the Welsh-based
Ryan International group. The project is one of 12 licences in which UWCC is
involved with the private sector.
This story of the soil nailing machine illustrates the emphasis at UWCC on
commercial services and technology-transfer schemes. The college, with 1,000
academic staff, 28 schools and departments and more than 9,000 students, is
the largest of the colleges that make up the University of Wales. Its size
and commercial contacts mean that it has a significant role in the life of
the city.
In 1989-1990, it won Pounds 2.1m worth of research contracts from British
industry, and through other consultancy work generated an additional Pounds
1.8m. There have been several instances of high-technology companies being
spun off by the university college, as a result of projects in which it was
involved.
Geraint Jones is the head of UWCC's commercial services section, and at the
forefront of efforts to boost academic and industry links. 'There is often a
difference in time scales, but our people are very appreciative of
industry's ethos. It is important to retain a balance between pure research
and the subsequent use of new knowledge,' he said.
The section acts as a focus for liaison with industry. Companies involved in
projects include such big names as British Steel, Ferranti, Procter and
Gamble, as well as local companies. Links are further fostered through
placements of Cardiff graduates in 15 companies, to help with research under
the Science and Engineering Research Council's Teaching Company scheme.
UWCC prides itself on a number of pace-setter departments which are
generally regarded as centres of academic excellence. These include city and
regional planning, aeronautical and mechanical engineering, maritime
studies, nasal physiology, the semi-conductor and microelectronics centre,
and the automotive industry unit at the Cardiff Business School, which is
part of the university college.
The mood at UWCC is one of cautious optimism, exemplified by a new Pounds
27m engineering faculty building scheduled to come on stream by 1993 and
catering for 1,100 students. UWCC has also emerged as one of the UK's
leading centres of Japanese studies with a number of Japanese joint honours
schools introduced at undergraduate level where Japanese is combined with
such disciplines as law or business studies.
The university college's most direct contact with business in Cardiff is
through the Cardiff Business School, the fourth largest in the UK with 1,000
students and 13 full-time professors. Its courses include both undergraduate
and postgraduate work and the school tailors courses for managers in local
companies. Recent research contracts include a study of the Principality's
labour market, for Welsh Water.
Professor Roger Mansfield, the school's head, sees a role for the school as
a catalyst and enabler, to improve management skills in Wales. 'The rapid
development of short courses is based firstly on serving the growing needs
of the region, and secondly, developing courses in areas of particular
research strength.'
Cardiff is particularly strong in the automative industry, Professors Dan
Jones and Garel Rhys having built an international reputation. Consequently,
most of the big motor manufacturers have used Cardiff for consulting work.
At a non-academic level, training and education for jobs in Cardiff is
focused on the new South Glamorgan Training and Education Council (TEC), set
up in February. It has a staff of 50 and a budget of Pounds 12m. Paul
Sheldon, its chief executive, believes the tough decisions the TEC will be
making on training-provision in Cardiff are bound to be controversial:
'Our primary client is the employer. We have to ensure that we are training
people for real jobs. That means we will have to look carefully at the
quality and scope of the training on offer at present.'
The South Glamorgan TEC faces four priorities in determining the future of
training in the Welsh capital:
The TEC has to carry out a quality audit of training provision, and decide
which courses and schemes to scrap. Mr Sheldon thinks the 60 organisations
currently involved in training is too many.
There needs to be greater targeting in training in Cardiff. Traditionally,
the take up-rates for adult training in Cardiff is around 90 per cent of
places filled, compared with 60 to 70 per cent nationally. However, if
people in Cardiff are being trained for skills where there are no job
prospects, such courses will have to be scrapped, and emphasis placed on
market-led targetting.
There are no models to forecast how the south-east Wales economy will
perform - an obstacle to detailed labour-market planning. Discussions are
being held with various groups in Cardiff to see if such a model can be
developed.
The public sector as an employer plays a crucial role in the Cardiff labour
market, with nearly 50 per cent of jobs in the city coming from the public
sector. Public sector orientated programmes need to be included in training
provision.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (4): Authorities back a five-year
initiative - Marketing the city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST DAVID's Day is always special for the Welsh, but this year March 1 was
extra special for Cardiff. In the presence of the Princess of Wales, and
with the young Prince William making his first public appearance, the city
launched a marketing campaign to make itself better known and understood
around the world.
Under the aegis of the city, five public bodies unveiled a Pounds 10m
marketing programme with the title: Just Capital.
The five are: South Glamorgan county council, the Welsh Development Agency,
the Wales Tourist Board, Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and the city
council. They guaranteed to put up Pounds 5m over the next five years, and
set out to find a similar sum from the private sector. Marks and Spencer
immediately contributed Pounds 20,000.
At the same time, it was announced that Wynford Evans, chairman of the
recently-privatised South Wales Electricity, would become chairman of
Cardiff Marketing, a private company established out of the ashes of the
municipally-run Cardiff Marketing Bureau, on June 1; and that Norma Jarboe
would take over immediately as chief executive.
'The problem Cardiff has always had to face,' says Mr David Seligman, a
solicitor and city councillor who headed the move to go private, and who
remains chairman of Cardiff Marketing until Mr Evans takes over, 'is that
people have the wrong impression about the city. Abroad, they simply wonder
where it is in the UK. Here at home, it is generally seen as a dirty place
with few amenities, not worth a visit. Incredibly, people still think it's a
town of coal and steel.
'Once they get here, they find a magnificent modern city, a city that can
fill a theatre with opera and a concert hall on the same night. What they
find is not at all what they imagined. Our task is therefore to get the
world to see that Cardiff is a fine place: that way, we shall attract
tourists, inward investment, more jobs and help enlarge the city's
prosperity.'
That view is echoed by Miss Jarboe, who can take a dispassionate approach.
'Changing the image is what we must be about,' she says. 'People who come
are bowled over, and are only too happy to return.'
Discounting the fact that it is Miss Jarboe's job to 'sell' the city, she
can be more dispassionate than the locally-born solicitor who is her present
chairman, because she is an American and her links with the Welsh capital
were minimal before her appointment.
Norma Jarboe, who is 44, was born in New Mexico, moved east to college in
Denver, and still farther east to work in New York on urban affairs and
public-policy planning for Citibank. Soon after the Brixton riots in London,
in 1981, the bank was asked to second someone to London to work on
inner-city problem areas, and she was 'volunteered'. Although primarily
concerned with Brixton after her arrival in London, her work subsequently
branched into fellowship programmes and youth enterprise schemes; until
1986, when she herself branched out as a consultant in the field of public
affairs, community relations, sponsorship and communications.
The thinking behind Cardiff's marketing programme has been heavily
influenced not only by the need to alter perceptions of the city, but also
by the success that Glasgow achieved with its Glasgow's Miles Better
campaign.
'Glasgow have done what we want to do here,' Mr Seligman says. 'At one time
Glasgow was thought of as a rough, tough city. Today, it is seen as a city
of culture, a place of refinement, a place in which to do business, and a
place where people will happily move to work.'
Mr Seligman wants people around the world to think in the same way about
Cardiff. 'Despite the general perception, we have already had a lot of
success in attracting companies here. We have attracted Tesco with a
headquarters operation, for instance, National Provident Institution and
Rothschild. All of these have come in the past few years, so we knew that
with a bit of a push we could use the campaign to broaden and develop the
economic base of the city.'
Miss Jarboe says that the first step will be to bring the message to the
city itself. Already posters with the Just Capital logo are beginning to
appear on sites around the city. 'We must give them a sense of involvement,
a sense of pride,' she says.
Miss Jarboe speaks quickly. Thoughts and ideas pour out of her. 'Take the
taxi drivers,' she says. 'They are often the first people a visiting
businessman meets. Get them to enthuse about the city, give them civic
pride, and they will help influence the visitor. When we have laid the
groundwork here in Cardiff, we'll take the programme wider: national within
the UK first, then international. This has always been an international
city, and we will capitalise on that.'
All this is planned on Pounds 2m a year in each of the coming five years.
Can it be achieved? More important, can the Pounds 5m that has to come from
the private sector be raised?
Cardiff is not a city of big employers. Few have more than 1,000 people, and
few of these have their headquarters in the city. Most of the potential
donors that Mr Evans will have to approach probably have headquarters in the
south east of England, so their allegiance to the Welsh capital is not as
deep as his own.
His task as chairman of Cardiff Marketing is all about money and raising it;
but in the present economic climate, charitable giving is being reduced.
The Welsh politician, Ray Gunter, said in 1964, when Harold Wilson appointed
him minister of labour, that he had been given the 'bed of nails'. The
parallel with Mr Evans' task is not inapposite.

THIS IS Europe Week in Cardiff. The festival is a promotion of Europe within
the Welsh capital and, in particular, of the city's place within Europe.
It sees French fashion, German food, Italian music, opera from the Welsh
National Opera Company - and, this being Wales, a rugby festival.
Cardiff is Europe's youngest capital, created in 1955. Although twinned with
Stuttgart and Nantes, it has not had particularly strong links with
continental Europe since its coal trade collapsed after the second world
war.
'This festival,' says Roger Paine, the city's chief executive, 'is intended
to raise the importance of Europe within Cardiff. In doing that, we want it
also to raise our profile within Europe.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (6): Principality House may set pace - The
property sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATER THIS summer, just off the main pedestrian shopping area of Queen
Street, Principality House, a new 62,500 sq ft office building, will be
completed at a cost of around Pounds 12m.
The development, undertaken by the Principality Building Society, could well
act as the new benchmark for Cardiff office rents.
The reason why the property sector is excited about the completion of
Principality House is that the 50,000 sq ft to be let (the rest will be
occupied by the society) could set a new high for office rents in the city.
At present, office rents are stalling at a Pounds 16.40 per square foot
high. Rents at Principality House could possibly reach Pounds 18.
Traditionally, rents in Cardiff have tended to be lower than in many other
regional centres, although prime office rents almost doubled from Pounds 8
per square foot in 1987 to Pounds 15 in 1990. A survey last year, by Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley, indicated that, while Cardiff was on a par with Newcastle
and Manchester, prime office rents in the Welsh capital were Pounds 3.20 per
square foot less than in Bristol, often used as a comparison with the city.
The property market in Cardiff has held up in the economic downturn. A
review by the property advisers Debenham Tewson showed that Cardiff had felt
the effects of recession less than cities such as Bristol and Leeds. Mr Rhys
James, a director of Debenham Tewson, said that rents in Cardiff had not
fallen during the past year.
Mr Roger Thomas, regional director of Cooke &amp; Arkwright, another of the
city's leading surveyors and estate agents, reports similar findings.
Activity in the commercial property sector has slowed over the past year,
but companies in the market for property are more selective, with continued
demand for good quality new or refurbished accommodation.
'We need to get the picture in perspective. The so-called property recession
does not compare with that of 1973-74 and 1983-84,' he said. 'Despite
short-term pressure, there are still underlying reasons for optimism about
the long-term future in Cardiff.'
The commercial property sector is predominantly office and retail space. By
the end of 1990, the city had nearly 4.5m sq ft of office space. However,
much of it consists of 1950s and 1960s buildings, which will either have to
be refurbished or pulled down in order to meet tenants' rising expectations.
New developments since the late 1980s have provided opportunities for
pioneering projects. 'Design is an important element of what contractors now
want, and there is a strong architectural tradition here,' commented Mr
Terry Hoggett, of architects Hogget Lock-Necrews, the firm which designed
Principality House.
Cardiff's property market falls into three distinct areas: the city centre;
the M4 corridor with business parks at St MelIons and Llanishen on the
outskirts of the city, and several retail projects located at Culverhouse
Cross; and the Bay area.
Rents in the centre and on the M4 corridor area are roughly the same, but it
is the Bay which could have the most impact in the long term. The
development is to be phased over a 15-year period, but the office space
allocation in the Bay area is more than 5m sq ft, rather more than Cardiff's
stock of office space at present.
However, in the city as a whole there is still a shortage of large office
units. It is a shortage that worries Mr Graham Moore, the property director
of the Welsh Development Agency:
'If we get a large company relocating and it needs 60,000 sq ft immediately,
we have got a problem. There is a window of opportunity in Cardiff, and
developers need to be encouraged to build speculative projects,' he said.
The WDA is not actively involved in the Cardiff office market. It is
concerned about the lack of institutional investment in speculative
development in the city, and the discrepancy in rents between the city and
other regional centres.
The Knight Frank &amp; Rutley report found that institutions were reluctant to
invest in Welsh office space. 'The small investment market in south-east
Wales has not yet reached the critical mass for a flourishing market to
develop,' it stated.
Mr David Swallow joined the WDA last year in a newly-created post of private
funding director. The agency hopes that its Welsh Property Venture
Initiative, which seeks generally to attract institutional money into Welsh
property, will have a spin-off effect on the Cardiff commercial sector.
Mr Swallow has found no such reluctance among the institutions to invest
heavily in the retail sector. Demand for retail property has been hit by the
general cutback in high street spending, although with a catchment area of
1.3m shoppers several new developments have come on stream. GRE Properties,
which has opened a specialist centre called the Capitol site, in the city
centre, has introduced a number of turnover rental deals, a new feature of
retail rents in South Wales.
Industrial property in Cardiff often tends to be overshadowed in what is
essentially a service city. The market was affected by the loss of land to
B1 use, and the relocation of business from parts of Cardiff Bay as that
area was prepared for redevelopment. Consequently it has been difficult to
identify trends.
Rents have been sustainable with modern units of under 3,000 sq ft reaching
between Pounds 5 and Pounds 5.50 per square foot. Medium-sized modern units
are fetching rents in excess of Pounds 4 per square foot, and larger units
around Pounds 3. Interest in the sites and units being developed in Cardiff
Bay is continuing to grow, although there are unlikely to be any mass
building programmes in the city in the immediate future.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (3): The barrage meets its first storm -
Cardiff Bay / The future of the plan, after a parliamentary jolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY PEOPLE describe Cardiff as a major international city waiting to
happen. After the confusion in parliament last month, the wait may be longer
than they expect.
Progress of a locally-sponsored private bill, to allow a barrage to be built
across Cardiff Bay, creating a non-tidal 500-acre freshwater lake, was
blocked at an all-night sitting. A group of Labour MPs who oppose the
scheme, largely on environmental grounds, made long speeches and raised
persistent objections.
The government says it will now take over legislation to build the barrage,
and bring in its own bill.
Without the barrage, which would cost about Pounds 80m, says the Cardiff Bay
Development Corporation, Cardiff will not be transformed into an important
maritime city. The corporation is charged with renovating and developing
2,700 acres of partly-derelict land around the bay.
Although Cardiff is the national capital of Wales, it has yet to find a new
wider role. The bay was once the port for heavy industry; but coal and steel
went into decline, and Cardiff, though still active as a port, conducts a
fraction of the business it once did. Much of the land around the bay has
fallen into disrepair. The bay itself is heavily tidal, with an average drop
of 40ft between tides. At low water, it is a vista of unattractive mud
flats.
Under Mr Peter Walker, the former secretary of state for Wales, new
industries, both British and foreign, were attracted to the valleys and
other parts of Wales. Cardiff has begun to develop as a financial centre,
servicing these industries. It has also become something of a media city,
with many independent film-production companies. But in terms of rebirth, it
trails behind such cities as Bristol and Cambridge.
Some relocation towns along the M4 have developed London-type congestion and
high costs. Cardiff, towards the end of the motorway, has not yet been
overrun by developers. Land and property were cheap, and skilled labour was
available. What was needed was for the land around the bay to be revived. In
1987, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was set up.
Like many of the other 10 urban development corporations, its purpose was to
rejuvenate and restore degraded acres, using government money as a catalyst.
Its plans were drawn on a grand scale: 1,000 acres of the 2,700 under its
control were considered to be immediately developable. Within 10 years, some
4m sq ft of office space and 5m sq ft of industrial factories could be
built. There would be 6,000 houses, a quarter of them social accommodation
for low-income families.
There were plans for an opera house and a maritime museum, as well as
marinas, hotels and shops; 30,000 jobs would be created directly, and up to
15,000 indirectly; around Pounds 2bn of private capital would be invested.
Cardiff would become a grand maritime city, a bit like Sydney.
The barrage across the bay was the basis for the grand design - but without
it, the mudflats were so unattractive that investors and developers would
not take the bay seriously.
Three years were put into preparing the private bill. It had to be a
parliamentary private bill, because the barrage was a single engineering
project, albeit a large one. But now the bill has now been thrown out.
What has gone wrong? In a sense, nothing. David Hunt, the present secretary
of state for Wales, has said that the government will pick up the
parliamentary bill, and make it part of its official business. With the
government whips behind it, it will almost certainly get through at some
point. But the question is: when?
Much of the opposition to the barrage was on environmental grounds. The
mudflats are the habitat of wading birds, and the bay has been designated a
site of special scientific interest. There were fears that a barrage would
cause flooding. The rivers Taff and Ely flow into the bay, and there has
been flooding in the past. A fresh-water lake would create problems with
algae, said opponents of the barrage, so that the lake would be muddy brown
rather than blue, making swimming impossible. Finally, it was suggested, the
ground water-table would be affected by a lake, so that houses would
suddenly start to develop fungus in their basements.
The seven Labour MPs, who conducted the filibuster that blocked the private
bill, emphasised these issues. But many of the criticisms have been met by
the development corporation. It says research has shown that algae can be
dealt with, as can the threat of flooding. The corporation proposes to spend
Pounds 5m to provide an alternative wildlife sanctuary for the wading birds
a few miles way. The ground-water problem is being investigated.
At bottom, the opposition of the Labour MPs ' not all of them Cardiff
members ' seemed to centre not simply on environmental problems, but on a
mix of arguments. These ranged from the view that Cardiff should become a
better capital of Wales rather than an international city, to the belief
that too many developers would make too much money out of lakeside projects.
The development board may have done itself a disservice by inadvertently
creating the impression that, without the barrage, there would be no
development around the bay.
This is not the case. So far, the private sector has invested about Pounds
250m in the bay area. The board itself has been active in infrastructural
development. It is spending money on a peripheral distributor road, which
loops off to the east and west of the M4.
Perhaps because of the time taken over the bill, it has studied other
development areas and learned from their mistakes. Unlike Southampton, say,
where the waterfront developments are divided from the old town centre,
Cardiff Bay projects will be locked on to the established city centre.
The development corporation is anxious to begin; the South Glamorgan county
council supports the barrage; Cardiff city council wants it.
The danger is that the government bill, which Mr Hunt now promises, may be a
long time coming. A general election might bring a change of government, and
the Labour party does not have the same commitment to the barrage.
Further delay could mean the difference between a piecemeal waterside
development and a dream enterprise. Opinion polls in the local press suggest
that most of the people favour the dream.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Saab-Scania falls 47% as car
division losses mount

<TEXT>
SAAB-SCANIA, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group, yesterday reported a
47 per cent fall in profits after financial items to SKr267m (Dollars 43m)
for the first quarter of 1991, due to mounting losses at Saab Automobile.
Saab-Scania, recently bought out by the investment group controlled by the
Wallenberg family, predicted that annual earnings would be lower than the
1990 result of SKr2.2bn. Group sales slipped by 6 per cent to SKr6.94bn
(Dollars 1.11bn), mainly because the Scania truck division suffered a 10 per
cent fall in sales to SKr5.4bn.
Losses at Saab Automobile, the 50:50 joint venture with General Motors,
increased by 52 per cent to SKr1.011bn during the period. This reduced
profits for Saab-Scania by SKr506m. Excluding Saab Automobile, profits for
the rest of Saab-Scania declined 6 per cent to SKr764m.
Saab Automobile reported a 16 per cent fall in volume sales to 20,800
vehicles, with demand weakening mainly in the Nordic region. Sales amounted
to SKr3.36bn, a 18 per cent fall. Sales for Saab Automobile are not
consolidated in Saab-Scania results.
Saab-Scania and General Motors are discussing a new injection of capital
into Saab Automobile. They will decide whether more funds are needed for the
company's rationalisation after a review of its capital structure is
completed in June. No forecast was offered for Saab Automobile's 1991
profits. The company noted that rationalisation measures taken in 1990 did
not affect the first-quarter results.
Scania division earnings were also lower than last year's first quarter, but
were not specified. Scania's annual profits were predicted to be below last
year's SKr2.9bn. Sales of trucks and buses fell by 6 per cent to 7,800
vehicles.
Profits increased at the aerospace division, however, with a 17 per cent
rise in sales to SKr1.18bn as orders climbed for the Saab 340 and Saab 2000
commuter aircraft. Earnings for 1991 are expected to exceed last year's
SKr111m.
Saab Combitech, the defence technology division, reported unchanged earnings
on sales up by 38 per cent to SKr622m.

ASSURANCES Generales de France (AGF), the country's second largest
state-owned insurer, shrugged off losses on its international activities
last year to produce a 5 per cent overall net profits increase, writes
William Dawkins.
AGF's net earnings rose in line with forecasts to FFr2.7bn (Dollars 461m)
from FFr2.57bn in 1989, on turnover up by 20 per cent over the same period,
to FFr46.03bn from FFr38.22bn, the group said yesterday. Half of the
turnover growth came from acquisitions.
Group investment income rose to FFr9.18bn from FFr7.67bn, while profits on
asset sales climbed to FFr3.37bn from FFr2.45bn.
Life insurance produced an 8.8 per cent rise in sales to FFr15.9bn, with
growth mainly coming from savings and retirement contracts. Profits on AGF's
life activities rose by 4.6 per cent to FFr1.5bn net.
AGF's international division saw its turnover rise by 54 per cent to
FFr11.2bn from FFr7.2bn, within which 38 per cent came from new acquisitions
including NEM in Britain, ICI in Ireland and l'Escaut, a Belgian insurer.
AGF's reinsurance business produced a 17 per cent rise in turnover to
FFr2.3bn.

ZENITH Electronics, which is competing for a share of the high-definition
television market, yesterday unveiled a deeper first-quarter loss and a drop
in sales.
The US company, which is in the middle of a proxy battle, incurred a
first-quarter net loss of Dollars 23.7m, or 85 cents a share, compared with
a loss of Dollars 4m, or 15 cents, last time.
Mr Jerry Pearlman, chairman, described the first-quarter results as
'unsatisfactory'.
News of the loss was not expected to help Zenith as it fights a proxy
contest by Nycor to replace three directors. A count of the proxy votes from
yesterday's annual meeting was not expected to be announced for at least
several weeks.
Nycor, a holding company spun off from Fedders, the air conditioner maker,
holds 8.2 per cent of Zenith's shares. It claims the company has no business
plan to turn around consumer electronic losses. Nycor and Fedders are
controlled by the Giordano family of New Jersey.
Zenith has responded that the Giordanos, with only low technology
experience, do not understand the long-term, high-tech strategy of the
company, which is engaged in a race for the estimated Dollars 80bn market of
high-definition television.
Zenith may have undermined Nycor's arguments about weakness in consumer
electronics with its sale in March of a near 5 per cent stake to Goldstar,
South Korea's largest consumer electronics maker, for Dollars 15m.
Goldstar wanted access to the US company's high technology.

LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, the newly-formed French water distribution and
construction combine, reported increased turnover and profits for 1990,
writes William Dawkins.
The group turned in net profits of FFr1.42bn (Dollars 230m) last year,
slightly below the FFr1.48bn forecast by the Lyonnaise des Eaux water
distribution group and the Dumez construction company at the time of their
merger in July.
The result is a 12.8 per cent increase on the combined earnings in the
previous year, on a 13.4 per cent increase in pro-forma turnover to FFr72bn.
Earnings per share rose 17.6 per cent to FFr31.6.
Mr Guy de Panafieu, group administrator and managing director, forecast that
turnover would rise by between 5 and 10 per cent this year.
The former Lyonnaise des Eaux contributed FFr896m to net profits.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Hardy Oil &amp; Gas calls for Pounds 27.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDY OIL &amp; Gas, the exploration company demerged from Trafalgar House,
yesterday launched a 1-for-4 rights issue of 17.8m shares to raise about
Pounds 27.6m.
Shareholders will be offered new shares at 160p apiece to enable the group
to invest in further exploration.
The cash call was accompanied with an up-beat profit forecast for the year
to March 31.
Group profit after tax is expected to almost double to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds
5.1m), after taking into account estimated Petroleum Revenue Tax credits of
Pounds 4m.
However, the recent fall in oil prices forced the group to warn that the
current year's trading profits might be 'adversely affected', despite
hedging two thirds of its oil production. Analysts believe profits could
fall by up to Pounds 7m.
Hardy's share price - after an initial fall of 10p - recovered to end the
day 5p down at 192p.
Earlier this month the company announced its most significant gas find in
the North Sea, 150 miles east of Aberdeen, since joining the stock market
two years ago.
It has also announced discoveries of potential significance in the US,
Canada and the Netherlands, while building up a portfolio of exploration
acreage, with stakes in noted oil-bearing regions such as the Gulf of Mexico
and Western Australia.
Mr Peter Elwes, chief executive, said he wanted to build on the recent
discoveries. The rights issue was an exercise 'in cash flow management.' It
would help fund the exploration which would generate the group's income.
He also hoped it would help reduce borrowing, although he added that since
the group's debt was all project-related he was not under any pressure to
tap the equity market for cash.
Hardy's share of the development of the Ravenspurn North gas field and the
acquisition of an interest in the producing Harriet oil field in Australia
have been financed largely by bank loans. By the end of last month some
Pounds 35.4m had been borrowed.
Mr Elwes hoped the contribution to profits from the sale of gas -
particularly from Ravenspurn, which is priced in sterling and not subject to
short-term price fluctuations - would do much to offset the instability of
the oil price.
To finance acquisitions and drilling in North America the company has
arranged an Dollars 80m (Pounds 46.8m) credit facility. At the end of March
it had borrowed Dollars 53.2m of this amount.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Devenish hits back at criticism on strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVENISH, the West Country brewer fighting off a hostile bid from
Boddington, yesterday gave its first detailed response to the attack on its
strategy by the pubs, hotels and health-care group.
Directors met with advisers to begin drawing up 'a line by line rebuttal' to
be sent to shareholders by May 6, 14 days after Boddington issued its formal
offer document.
Mr Michael Cannon, chairman of Devenish, responding to allegations that his
company had committed a U-turn in buying and then selling wholesalers,
accused Boddington of the 'biggest ever U-turn' in brewing history.
Mr Cannon said: 'Ours was a blip of a U-turn compared with their massive
blunder. The sale of our wholesalers was just a short, sharp reversal of
strategy which generated a healthy profit. The same can not be said for
Boddington's decision to buy and then sell its breweries.'
Boddington bought the Oldham Brewery in 1982, followed by the acquisition of
Higsons Brewery three years later. The group's brewing business was then
sold by November 1989.
The group said it recognised that 'the longer term prospects for profitable
growth linked to brewing and brand ownership were unexciting'.
In response to Boddington's accusation that Devenish had failed to achieve
its ambition of increasing its estate from 400 to 1,000 houses, Mr Cannon
said he still intended to buy more pubs 'but only when the price is right'.
The West Country brewer is already buying individual pubs but admitted that
it has put its plans to bid for a for a larger group of pubs on hold until
the big brewers drop their prices.
Mr Cannon also denied Boddington's charge that Devenish had wasted millions
of pounds of shareholders' money on advertising the Newquay Steam brand. He
said the promotional expenditure had been worthwhile and had helped push up
sales to about 100,000 barrels a year.
He added: 'The board's investment in Newquay Steam achieved its purpose. How
does Boddington expect to launch a new product without advertising?'

FT  25 APR 91 / Business Law: A case of good timing over VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE few opportunities more welcome than that of using someone else's
money, free of charge. When that opportunity is offered by the government to
exporters of goods in the form of a cash refund of tax not yet paid, it
would be madness not to take advantage of it.
This has certainly been the view of a number of manufacturing exporters in
relation to value added tax and, until Customs and Excise attacked the
Philips Electrical group of companies, at the end of 1989 the arrangement
apparently worked well. How that arrangement operated demonstrates a
principle of VAT which is of interest and potential benefit not just to
exporters but to all those who pay it.
The events which followed the attack on Philips reveal a good deal of
confusion in VAT administration policy.
The scheme, if it can be called that, used the simple mechanics of VAT to
achieve a substantial cash flow benefit. It works as follows.
A business which sells goods only to UK customers taxes those sales at the
standard rate of 17.5 per cent. It will pay over to Customs the tax which it
charges and collects (output tax) having first deducted from that payment
the amount of VAT paid to its own suppliers on purchases and other
expenditure (input tax). A business which sells goods for export does not
charge VAT on those sales (they are zero-rated) but can claim back its input
tax from Customs, ie, it receives repayments of VAT. The difference between
the two types of businesses is that an export business can claim its VAT
repayments monthly, whereas most businesses which have to charge their
customers VAT make returns and account for VAT quarterly.
A company which makes both standard-rated sales in the UK and zero-rated
export sales would normally make three-monthly VAT returns. Such a company
can improve substantially its cash flow by selling the exports through a
subsidiary, registered separately for VAT. The export company then makes
monthly returns, claiming repayments of the tax charged to it on sales by
the parent, up to 10 weeks before that same tax has to be paid by the parent
to Customs and Excise.
The advantage to be gained by doing this was recognised by a number of
companies as long ago as the early 1970s when VAT was first introduced in
the UK. They have operated the system successfully since then, and with at
least tacit approval from Customs and Excise evidenced by their
discretionary agreement to the use of monthly returns.
However, for reasons that have never been made clear, Customs took exception
to the scheme operated by Philips. Philips' appeal went first to the VAT
Tribunal where Philips lost; then to the High Court in May last year where
Customs conceded defeat having agreed the tribunal's decision was wrong.
At the same time, Customs asked the judge, Mr Justice Roch, to give his view
on the critical point of the tribunal decision - whether or not Philips had
made a 'supply' to the export company.
Originally, Customs had informed Philips that there was in its view no
supply of the goods to the export company and the supply for export was in
fact made direct from the manufacturer. Thus there was no tax to be charged
between the companies and no claim to input tax to be made by the export
company.
The tribunal supported Customs, saying that if the export company did take
ownership of the goods at all, it was for so fleeting a moment as to be
compared with an inter-city express train passing through a station. There
could therefore be no supply made under those conditions.
In the High Court the matter was settled by consent, leaving Philips to
continue with the scheme subject to agreed conditions. In the judge's
opinion there was no requirement in the VAT legislation as to the length of
time for which a transferee should have ownership of the goods to establish
that a supply had been made to him.
He went on to make the incisive comment that any other interpretation would
create considerable difficulties in the levying and recovery of VAT,
particularly in chains of transactions where title might pass
instantaneously through a number of persons.
There is much to be read between the lines in this case. It is clear from
their conduct of the case that, having argued the point successfully at the
VAT Tribunal, Customs suddenly realised that the decision would cause
enormous administrative difficulties. This shows an unexpected lack of
foresight in a department responsible for an important part of government
policy.
In any event, there was a clean and simple alternative for Customs. Monthly
returns are allowed at the discretion of the commissioners and, if they
wished to make Philips an exception to the generally permissive treatment
accorded to exporters, the commissioners could have directed Philips Exports
Ltd to make quarterly returns.
This would have largely erased the cash flow benefit of the scheme to the
company. To reverse that direction, Philips would have had to show that the
commissioners were behaving unreasonably in denying them the monthly
facility.
What then prompted Customs to take the action they did? To understand their
position, it must be appreciated that the VAT timing point used in the
export scheme is a general feature of the UK VAT system and can provide a
benefit even without intentional arrangement.
As the quarterly tax periods allocated to businesses for VAT accounting are
not all coincidental (Customs could not cope with 1.4m returns at one time)
there are three different quarterly return groups, the maximum variation in
period ends being two months.
In large commercial transactions, particularly property transfers, this can
be important because the VAT charge on a sale can be a cash flow cost or a
benefit, depending upon whether the vendor must account to Customs for the
output tax before or after the purchaser obtains the benefit of his claim to
the input tax.
There have been wholly contrived cases, which have demonstrated the timing
point only too well and have rightly been stopped. There was, for instance,
the enterprising individual who registered two businesses with conveniently
overlapping VAT periods. He then 'sold' an article of jewellery at a grossly
inflated price from one business to the other, thereby creating a charge of
VAT which could be claimed as input tax and banked for the remaining time
before it was to be paid over as output tax by the 'vendor'.
Nevertheless, it must be said that, in general, Customs have never been too
happy when the timing works against them, despite the rigidity of the tax
point regime which they insist must be observed by taxpayers.
When VAT was introduced on land and buildings in 1989, it was pointed out to
the department that businesses might suffer if they had to wait for three
months to claim the substantial input tax on the purchase of new premises.
At that time, Customs said that they would consider making early repayments
of tax in such cases, before the normal quarterly period end.
In reality, the position is quite different. Businesses which make unusual
claims to repayment of tax must undergo time-consuming credibility checks
even where the claim is made at the normal time. These will frequently
involve visits from the local VAT office before their claims are approved
for payment. Some of those checks are to ensure that the vendor has properly
accounted for the tax which includes a check on the due date for payment.
This attitude is an unnecessary source of annoyance, as well as cost, to the
trading community. On the whole, the VAT system works to the advantage of
the Revenue. However, the system which provides for easily administered,
self-assessed tax collection at each stage of the journey from production to
final consumer inevitably contains in its structure benefits for some
taxpayers. This should be accepted by Customs.
Further, the civil penalty system, progressively introduced since 1985,
allows for little or no mitigation when errors or defaults are made by
taxpayers. It is tempered only by a concession that in cases where Customs
are extremely late in making repayments Customs will pay a compensation
supplement.
Because these sanctions against underpayment of VAT are heavily biased in
favour of the Revenue it is hard to see the justification for tilting the
administrative balance of the collection system any further in favour of the
department. If a realisation of that fact was at least part of the reason
for Customs withdrawing from the Philips case, it would be an encouraging
sign of as yet unseen maturity in the administration of VAT.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ashtead seeks Pounds 5.8m and sees profit
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONRUSH of equity financing in the construction industry continued
yesterday when Ashtead, the acquisitive plant hire group, announced it was
raising approximately Pounds 5.8m net of expenses in a 1-for-4 rights issue.
The issue of 4.49m new ordinary shares at 135p represents a 15.6 per cent
discount to Tuesday's market price. Yesterday the shares slipped 2p to 158p
on the news. The new shares will rank for the final dividend for the year to
April 30.
The move is aimed at strengthening the group's financial position to enable
it to take advantage of the opportunities for expansion in the wake of the
recession, directors said.
'Our competitors clearly have had a horrid time, and we expect more to go
into receivership as conditions improve,' said Mr Peter Lewis, chairman.
Historically bankers have tended to let their troubled customers go when it
looks like they are going to be able to sell their assets, he explained.
Additionally, Ashtead considers that its 5 per cent share of the
highly-fragmented UK plant hire industry leaves it with significant scope
for further expansion.
The group's strategy through the current UK recession has been to maintain
its business infrastructure of 49 profit centres and increase its market
share even at the expense of short-term profitability.
The rights issue was announced as Ashtead forecast a near-halving of pre-tax
profits for the year to April 30.
In the absence of unforeseen circumstances profits will be not less than
Pounds 4m and earnings per share not less than 14.3p, the company said.
This represents a 49 per cent fall in profits from last year's Pounds 7.82m
and a 50 per cent drop in earnings per share from a previous 28.44p.
Trading conditions deteriorated in the second half, following a
disappointing first half which saw profits fall 31 per cent to Pounds 2.5m
(Pounds 3.6m).
Operating margins, although still among the highest in the industry, slipped
from 20 per cent to 18 per cent in the second half, resulting in a forecast
of 19 per cent for the whole year.
Pending acquisitions, the proceeds of the rights issue will be used to
reduce borrowings which have risen to about Pounds 14m. Gearing, which stood
at over 83 per cent at the year-end will come down to about 40 per cent,
directors said.
'I think we have taken our medicine in the form of this year's results, and
now we stand a better chance to benefit from any upturn in the industry,' Mr
Lewis said.
On the basis of its profits forecast, the group expects to recommend a final
dividend of not less than 3.025p making a total of 4.125p (3.75p).

<TEXT>
SOVEREIGN OIL &amp; Gas, the North Sea exploration and production company,
reported an advance from Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.9m in pre-tax profits for
1990 after a strong rise in oil prices at the outset of the Gulf crisis.
Mr David Biggins, managing director, said he hoped for some stability in the
value of sterling against the dollar this year to provide a reasonable
future for the company's business. The weakness of the dollar against the
pound had produced an oil price of Pounds 8 per barrel in February which was
'sheer misery' for North Sea independent oil producers, he said.
Sovereign is partly hoping to hedge its exposure to the dollar oil price by
increasing its stake in the Victor gas field which sells gas to British Gas
on long-term contracts priced in sterling. Sovereign increased its stake in
the field from 3 to 5 per cent with a Dollars 30m purchase from Superior
Oil, an affiliate of Mobil.
Turnover rose to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 12.3m). Earnings per share increased
from 0.9p to 4.9p.

<TEXT>
CO-OPERATIVE Wholesale Society, the co-operative trading company which has
substantial interests in retailing, farming and manufacturing, raised
trading profits from Pounds 30.7m to Pounds 44.1m in the year to January 12.
However, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 19.7m to Pounds 19.1m after a
higher interest charge of Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 13.8m). And following a
Pounds 10.9m loss arising from bad-debt provisions in the banking group
there was only Pounds 12.3m transferred to reserves in comparison with
Pounds 34.7m last year.
Sir Dennis Landau, chief executive, said the society's property development
and engineering businesses had also proved vulnerable to the downturn in the
economy but that retailing had proved resilient and had increased profits by
Pounds 6m.
He singled out for praise the performance of the Scottish retailing arm
which which operates a wide spread of outlets, ranging from superstores to
small shops in the Orkney, Shetland and Western Isles.
In total, the group's retailing activities now represent 30 per cent of
turnover.
Almost half of CWS's business is accounted for by supplies to its retail
society shareholders although these operations are run on a cost-recovery
rather than a profit basis.
Sales topped Pounds 3bn for the first time climbing from Pounds 2.68bn to
Pounds 3.03bn as the society benefited from the inclusion of North Eastern
Co-op, which joined CWS in June.
During the year, CWS spent almost Pounds 150m on capital expenditure.
Sir Dennis said this had helped sow the seeds for future development which
augured well for the future of CWS and the Co-op as a whole.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Scottish Power boosts options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH POWER, the larger of the two Scottish electricity companies due to
be floated in May, said it had raised its exposure in the electricity
options market with a 77 per cent increase in its option contract with the
12 English regional electricity companies.
It also said that losses of supply contracts to industrial customers in its
own area in the current round were significantly smaller than in last
April's round.
Last year Scottish Power lost 6 per cent of its business with large
industrial customers - which take more than 1MW - measured by volume.
Although that is lower than the losses suffered by the regional companies in
England, Scottish Power emphasised that it was not immune from competition
in Scotland and that has had a 'material' effect on the prices it can
charge.
Scottish Power increased its power sales in volume terms in the past year by
7 per cent through exports to England.
The company has agreed option contracts covering 320MW of power to the
regional companies compared with 180MW last year. This is not a contract to
supply electricity but a financial instrument under which Scottish Power
guarantees a price for power which applies when the price prevailing in the
electricity pool exceeds it. The regional companies pay an initial fee and
Scottish Power still expects to make money if it has to supply the power.
Mr Michael Smith, marketing and distribution director, said Scottish Power
had signed option contracts with industrial users in England in the current
round of contracts which outweigh by three-and-a-half times the contracts
lost.
Scottish Power recently agreed with another supplier an option contract for
well over 200,000 gigawatt hours of power with an unnamed customer,
offsetting option contract losses of 83,000 gigawatt hours.
Mr Smith said that Scottish Power's retail shops had roughly doubled their
share of the south of Scotland white goods market last year to about 25 per
cent, thanks to a large scale reorganisation and upgrading of its shops.

<TEXT>
MR GERALD Abrahams, chairman of Aquascutum, has retired from the board of
the fashion company after 44 years' service.
His departure comes almost exactly a year after the acquisition of
Aquascutum by Renown, Japan's biggest clothing company.
At the time of the takeover, Mr Abrahams said that he looked forward to
working with Renown and continuing to run the company from London.
But his departure and the appointment as chairman of Mr Paul Bennett,
previously head of the company's Far East operations, is perhaps an
indication of the greater in-fluence Renown is now intending to exercise
over the business.
In particular, Renown is planning to speed up the development of the company
in North America and the UK.
Mr Bennett has also been appointed joint managing director along with Mr
James Stokes, the former vice-chairman.
Mr Abrahams' wife, Marianne, who was the ladies fashion director, has also
retired from the board.
They have however, been appointed the company's president and vice-president
respectively.

AUSTIN REED, the upmarket clothing retailer and manufacturer, blamed a
dearth of tourists and a 'white-collar recession' for a decline of nearly 48
per cent in pre-tax profit for the year to January 31.
The taxable figure fell from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 3.6m, the lowest since
1983. Turnover declined by nearly 8 per cent to Pounds 78.4m (Pounds 85m)
and trading profit by 34 per cent to Pounds 6.5m (9.9m). Interest charges
were little changed at Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 3m).
Mr Barry Reed, chairman and grandson of the founder, said the start to the
current year had been the worst he could remember. He has been on the board
for 33 years.
The final dividend is held at 6.5p, making an unchanged total of 9.5p. This
was only just matched by earnings per share of 9.5p (17.3p).
An extraordinary loss of Pounds 1.3m on the closure of Cashmeres of Scotland
led to a retained loss.
Cashmeres, which was built up to 11 small US branches, had entailed an
investment of Dollars 2.2m (Pounds 1.3m) over the past 3 1/2 years, said Mr
Reed. Over the past two years it had lost Pounds 1.1m.
On UK trading, he said: 'The Gulf situation caused tourism to dry up which
affected retailing in London.
'While womenswear stayed level with the previous year, men's tailored
clothing was difficult. This recession has been atypical because it has been
a white collar one in London and the south-east.'
The group had closed two branches leaving a total of 40. About 10 per cent
of the 2,000 jobs in retailing and manufacturing had been shed.
In manufacturing, exports were up, sales to other retailers were 25 per cent
down and inter-company sales were static.
Borrowings (including credit finance) peaked at Pounds 20m but finished the
year at Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 13.7m), compared with shareholders' funds of
Pounds 54m (Pounds 55.8m).
COMMENT
It is possible to defend these figures as 'no worse than expected,' bearing
in mind the company's dependence on the highly elastic, south-eastern end of
the men's suit market. But there is still plenty of scope to quibble. Some
of the customers, for instance, must be in the less-squeezed, mortgage-free
bracket; the Cashmere venture was a failure; and the figures would have been
even worse but for a Pounds 500,000 property profit and a sharp cut in
capital spending. This year started with a 17 per cent sales fall in
February, since when some ground has been made up. Progress will come from
eliminating Cashmere's losses and lower interest payments; tight cost
control is promised. A forecast pre-tax profit of Pounds 4m, but a higher
tax rate, gives a prospective p/e of nearly 18 on the A share price of 170p.
Japanese takeovers of Daks-Simpson and Aquascutum have stirred up some
speculative interest, but with 60 per cent of the stock held by family,
directors and friends, it looks as though it will be up to the present
management to make better use of the prime sites and prestigious brand
names. They should be helped considerably by economic recovery.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ibex talks could lead to offer below market
value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBEX, the USM-quoted recruitment and employment agency, said yesterday that
it was in talks that might or might not lead to an offer being made at a
price materially lower than the current market value.
The announcement sent the shares plummetting 7p to 11p.
At 18p, they were standing at their lowest point since the company joined
the USM in April 1989, representing a steep decline in the company's market
value since it floated at 175p per share.
Ibex's market capitalisation at yesterday's closing level was Pounds 1.5m.
Ibex and Hoare Govett, its financial adviser, said they could provide no
further information on the situation.
Last September, the company reported that it had just broken even in the six
months to end-June, producing pre-tax profits of Pounds 7,000 against Pounds
1m in the corresponding period. That was after finance charges of Pounds
477,000 (Pounds 169,000).
Earnings per share were nil (5.7p).
Mr Hugh Laughland, chairman, then blamed the deterioration on a 'substantial
reduction' in demand for the group's services. Turnover was up at Pounds
17.77m (Pounds 15.23m) owing to an increased number of branches.
He also said the company had agreed to sell P&amp;M, its advertising business,
for a nominal sum.
The other main businesses are Austin Benn, a recruitment consultancy for
sales and marketing staff and ABC Contract Services, which supplies
temporary staff for the construction, warehousing and distribution
industries.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Disposal helps limit fall at British
Dredging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IN 1990
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a period when the UK building trade hit a severe recession - British
Dredging managed to limit its profits fall to just under 14 per cent, from
Pounds 4m to Pounds 3.45m.
The final dividend is raised to a proposed 4.8p, to lift the total from 7p
to 7.4p.
This marine dredging company is also involved in the supply of sand and
gravel, the manufacture of paving blocks, other concrete products and tiles,
builders' merchanting and ship repairing.
Mr Fane Vernon, chairman, said that the structure of the group was changed
significantly during the year by the sale in April of a 50 per cent stake in
British Dredging Aggregates to RMC Group for Pounds 4.39m and by July's
acquisition of Selco Trade Centres, the building materials supplier, for an
initial Pounds 3.5m.
Mr Vernon noted that the Pounds 443,000 contribution from Selco partly
offset reduced trading profits from established operations, where concrete
products fell to Pounds 792,000 (Pounds 1.23m) and marine aggregates to
Pounds 331,000 (Pounds 1.79m).
Group operating profits were down by Pounds 1.42m at Pounds 1.9m, though the
share of profit of associated undertakings rose to Pounds 308,000 (Pounds
13,000) and net interest received almost doubled to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds
674,000).
Earnings slipped to 13.06p (14.53p) per share. There was an extraordinary
gain of Pounds 2.58m (Pounds 322,000) relating mainly to proceeds from the
disposal to RMC.
The company was proud of its 'very strong' position, with net short-term
cash deposits, loan notes and investments at the year-end totalling Pounds
7.2m (Pounds 6.9m).

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: ADT reveals Dollars 96m provisions against
sold Sechura businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the Bermuda-based car auction and security group, has made provisions
of Dollars 95.7m (Pounds 56m), against businesses recently sold by Sechura,
a Canadian former associated company in which Mr Michael Ashcroft, ADT's
chairman and chief executive, has revealed an interest.
In a footnote to its annual report, filed with the Stock Exchange yesterday,
ADT revealed that last year Sechura disposed of a string of loss-making
businesses, and reorganised its capital structure. As a result of that
restructuring, ADT's former 47.8 per cent interest was eliminated.
Consequent on Sechura's restructuring, said the annual report, and 'given
the uncertainty with respect to the future value' of the businesses Sechura
has disposed of, ADT recorded 'provisions totalling Dollars 95.7m against
the carrying value of amounts owed by and investments made in these
operating businesses'.
The ADT report added: 'While the company may recover a portion of this sum,
the amount and timing is uncertain.'
The businesses Sechura disposed of had been sold to it by ADT in 1987.
Documents issued in December 1990 as part of Sechura's restructuring said
that Mr Michael Ashcroft and his wife, Susan, between them owned 29.1 per
cent of voting shares in Sechura.
Earlier this month Laidlaw, a Canadian waste management group which owns
28.4 per cent of ADT, sued the Bermuda-based group in a New York court,
alleging that transactions between ADT and Sechura had led to an 'illusory
profits stream' for ADT. The allegations were rejected by ADT, which
threatened a counter-suit for defamation.
Laidlaw withdrew its suit last week following an agreement that gives it
four seats on the ADT board and ensures that outsiders outnumber executive
directors there.
Laidlaw insisted, however, that it had only withdrawn, not dropped, its case
against ADT and said that investigations into its allegations would continue
through an audit committee set up by the new independent directors.
The ADT annual report makes no mention of Mr and Mrs Ashcroft's stake in
Sechura, and says: 'There were no contracts of significance during or at the
end of the year in which a director of the company is, or was, materially
interested.'
ADT shares closed 3p lower yesterday, at 86p.

Shares of Partridge Fine Arts yesterday fell by 6p to 73p after the antique
furniture dealer warned shareholders that trading in the current year had
been badly affected by the fall in the number of visitors, particularly from
the US.
Mr John Partridge, chairman, told the annual meeting that the decline in
trading would hit first half profits. The position would not improve until
more people came to the UK.
Turnover rose 2.9 per cent to Pounds 13.2m for the year to end-October,
although pre-tax profits advanced 28 per cent to Pounds 4.1m as a result of
increased cash resources.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Poor second half as CI dips 38%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CI GROUP, the formerly acquisitive steel and engineering concern, saw
pre-tax profit fall 38 per cent to Pounds 4.83m in the year to January 31.
The decline, from Pounds 7.77m, came in spite of a 9.5 per cent turnover
increase to Pounds 93.75m (Pounds 85.61m). CI said this was accounted for by
acquisitions early last year.
Mr Albert Hargreaves, chairman, said the pain of UK recession had been felt
since October. Only Pounds 1m was added to interim pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.8m.
In the steel division, turnover expanded 8 per cent to Pounds 49m, but
pre-tax profit fell 34 per cent to Pounds 3.2m. Worst hit had been sales of
reinforcing material to the construction industry.
Engineering turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 44.7m, but profit fell to
Pounds 1.62m. The capital goods business slipped into loss as sales
plummeted by a third.
Early this year, Mr Cedric Grew, a driving force behind the acquisitions
policy, resigned as chief executive.
He was replaced by Mr Rob Yates, the former head of the steel division.
Mr Hargreaves said the resultant review of activities had focused on the
problem areas of reinforcing, capital goods and part of the foundry
business. Two factories had been closed and further rationalisation was
going on. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.46m (Pounds 696,000) was made.
Some unspecified costs were also incurred above the line, as the workforce
was cut by 7 per cent to 1,500 and Mr Grew was paid off.
Mr Hargreaves said the group had grown quickly and encompassed 20 companies.
'But probably 80 per cent of the turnover is generated by 20 per cent of
them.'
It would concentrate on areas where it had a significant market share or a
concentration of management skills. A prime example was industrial flooring,
where Redman Fisher Engineering had won a Queen's Award for export.
Operating profit fell to Pounds 6.64m (Pounds 9.31m) and interest charges
rose to Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.55m). Year-end gearing was reduced to 40 per
cent (44 per cent) of shareholders' funds of Pounds 16m (Pounds 17m).
Capital spending was cut from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2.5m.
Earnings per share slid to 3.77p (5.93p). A slightly reduced final dividend
of 1.225p leaves the total unchanged at 2.05p.
COMMENT
Several nettles have been grasped at CI, as the changed leadership has given
belated priority to managing recession rather than growth by acquisition.
Cash has started to move in the right direction and orders have picked up
since a dismal February. With 79 per cent of sales in the UK, the group has
obvious vulnerability and many uncertainties remain, not least over how much
more the reorganisation will cost. A second-half improvement might rescue
profit to another Pounds 4.8m, a prospective p/e of 7.8 on yesterday's close
of 29 1/2 p. Its 25 per cent discount to the engineering sector reflects
uncertainty over both trading prospects and the results of the
reorganisation. Until the picture is clearer, the share price is unlikely to
make much headway.

With the management preferring to retain commercial properties rather than
sell them at the depressed prices of 1990, Dencora, the East Anglian
property group, saw profits fall from Pounds 7.06m to Pounds 2.21m pre-tax
in the 12 months to end-December.
Net asset value was down 17 per cent at 280p (336p). Turnover dropped to
Pounds 34.34m (Pounds 41.22m), with a contraction in trading to Pounds
27.31m (Pounds 36.1m) and an expansion in rental income to Pounds 7.04m
(Pounds 5.13m). Net interest payable was Pounds 405,000 higher at Pounds
5.35m.
Fully diluted earnings tumbled to 7.7p (21.6p) but the single dividend is
maintained at 5.5p. Bank borrowings at the year-end were up at Pounds 71m
(Pounds 59m).

FT  25 APR 91 / Manchester wins Olympic heat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE A bruising heavyweight boxer scoring a famous victory, Manchester
out-slugged London yesterday and won the right to bid for the Olympic Games
in the year 2000. The result was a terrible mauling for the capital but a
powerful boost to Manchester and north-west England.
At a meeting of the British Olympic Association (BOA) in London, Manchester
won unanimous support for its bid and was thus catapulted into the
billionaire bidding game that will preface the millennial Olympics.
The host city for the Games of 2000 will be chosen by the International
Olympic Committee in September 1993. Manchester's rivals are expected to
include Berlin, Peking, Sydney, Milan, Brasilia and Belgrade.
Last September Manchester was roundly defeated in its bid to stage the 1996
Olympics, which were won by Atlanta. But it says it has learnt from that
episode, and that its new bid will be better and stronger.
Mr Bob Scott, chairman of the Manchester Olympic bid committee, said
yesterday: 'We're going to go hell for leather for 2000. This is not just
Manchester's bid. It is the British bid.'
London's campaign was led by Mr Sebastian Coe - Olympic gold-medal runner,
millionaire world record holder and would-be Conservative MP. After losing
the vote, Mr Coe, crest-fallen, claimed London had mounted a credible bid.
The hope had been that a successful London campaign would have proved a
fillip for development in the Docklands area of east London and a spur to
accelerating transport and other spending.
But Mr Coe was floored by a campaign led by an even richer man, the Duke of
Westminster, president of the Manchester committee, who told the BOA that he
was not a Londoner but had lived in Chester for 22 years - and his family
for 900.
From the briskness and gumption displayed by the Duke and his colleagues, it
was clear Manchester was going to keep bidding for the Olympics until it won
them.
Manchester city council has said it will underwrite the bid. Fourteen
Olympic-style sports venues are said to exist already in Manchester and the
North-west, with eight to be built or under construction by September 1993
and a further five at the planning stage.
Manchester claims that its transport infrastructure is the best in Britain,
and that the core sports venues and planned Olympic village would be within
15 minutes of each other.
Mr Graham Stringer, leader of Manchester city council, said: 'We are
determined to give Manchester, and Britain, the best possible platform for
its case to host the 2000 Games.'
A study by Kleinwort Benson has forecast an Olympic operating surplus of
around Pounds 190m if Manchester wins.
According to insiders Manchester beat London because of the technical
competence of its experience of Olympic in-fighting. What hampered London,
it is thought - the BOA would not say - was the capital's lack of an
umbrella council, its crowdedness, grime, and terrible transport.
Yesterday it was tottery old London versus a wily and free-punching northern
foe - virtually a push-over.

FT  25 APR 91 / IMF urges cut-off point for benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, LISA WOOD and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CUT in the length of time during which unemployment benefit is paid in
Britain is urged by the International Monetary Fund, which also warns that
the UK is facing the deepest recession of the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries.
The IMF's suggestion of the benefits limit is a part of a package of
measures intended to curb the UK's high level of wage increases.
In its World Economic Outlook, the IMF says that action is needed to
increase the responsiveness of British wages to market conditions and to
promote labour mobility.
It also suggests 'increasing training programmes and improving the
functioning of labour exchanges' to prevent a rise in unemployment in the
recession similar to the sharp increase witnessed in the early 1980s.
Britain must maintain monetary and fiscal policies 'conducive to a
substantial downward adjustment in the growth of wages,' the IMF says.
While warning of the depth of the recession, the IMF says there is 'little
scope for a significant reduction in UK interest rates' unless this is fully
justified by sterling's position in the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System and clear signs that underlying inflation is
falling.
IMF projections point to a sharp 2.1 per cent drop in UK gross domestic
product this year. Growth next year is forecast at around 1.9 per cent.
However, unemployment will keep on rising in 1992 and is expected to average
8.5 per cent of the labour force next year compared to 7.5 per cent this
year and just 6 per cent in 1990.
Britain faces several years of slow growth, it indicates. Between now and
1996 the IMF expects GDP growth in the UK will lag slightly behind the
average annual increase of 2.1 per cent which was seen in the 1980s.
The IMF did not elaborate on its suggestion for a cut-off point on
unemployment benefit. The government said yesterday that it was keeping the
impact of the benefit system on the labour market under review but insisted
that it was not considering any proposals to cut the duration of
unemployment benefit payments.
Basic unemployment benefit, currently Pounds 41.40 a week, is paid in
Britain for up to a year, but after that individuals who have no savings can
claim indefinite income support at only a slightly lower weekly rate.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said: 'It would be wrong to
think that a cut in the period of unemployment benefit would, of itself,
bring lower unemployment.'
Mr Blair endorsed other comments in the report, saying: 'I would agree with
the IMF in the importance of better training, a better employment service
and, in particular, we believe it is right now to adopt a temporary work
programme to prevent the unemployed becoming long-term unemployed.'

FT  25 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Lyonnaise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was some confusion in Paris yesterday about what to make of last
year's FFr1.425bn net profit from Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the first set of
results since the utilities and construction groups merged their activities
in September. A figure close to FFr1.5bn had been forecast in the pro forma
profit and loss account. Lower than expected capital gains as well as a
disappointing performance from the Canadian construction materials group
Westburne appear to be responsible for the shortfall. Lyonnaise shares
slipped FFr9 to FFr618 on the day, though that may have had as much to do
with the forecast that this year's earnings would only advance in line with
the likely 5 to 10 per cent increase in sales.
At this early stage of the venture, it is difficult to tell whether Mr
Jerome Monod's vision of an integrated group solving problems of
infrastructure around the world will succeed. He certainly would appear to
be getting the upper hand in what many suspected would not turn out to be a
marriage of equals, or so the earlier than expected disposal of Dumez's
electrical equipment businesses would suggest. That might even point to a
Westburne sale as part of the ongoing programme of asset sales, though now
is hardly the best time in the cycle to be speeding it along.
French utilities have been popular with investors and Lyonnaise has
outperformed the market by 5 per cent over the last year. But the market's
hesitancy is reflected in the fact that its rival, Generale des Eaux, which
swallowed Societe Generale des Entreprises that much earlier, has
outperformed by 10 per cent over the same period.

FT  25 APR 91 / The Lex Column: ADT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the habitual secrecy of ADT's chairman Mr Michael Ashcroft, it was
never to be expected that the company's annual report would give many clues
to the real state of its affairs. But it does confirm what a deplorable
muddle ADT has become. Investors have every reason to ask why the disposal
of ADT's 48 per cent holding in Sechura has given rise to a Dollars 96m
write-off, or indeed why there is no suggestion in the accounts that a
principal shareholder in Sechura was Mr Ashcroft himself. Above all, there
is no real explanation of why a year which saw the issue of ADT paper to the
value of Dollars 335m also saw a horrendous drop of Dollars 842m in the
group's cash mountain.
As always, the answer will lie not in the group's operating businesses but
in Mr Ashcroft's dabblings around the fringe. So far as can be told from an
exceptionally opaque flow of funds statement, the operating businesses net
of capital expenditure, tax and dividends were broadly cash neutral in the
year. The same dabblings doubtless lie behind the drop of almost 20 per cent
in the group's net asset value in the year. It would be nice to know what
has happened to Mr Ashcroft's salary as a result of all this. Needless to
say, in accounts certified by Coopers &amp; Lybrand 'in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the UK', we are not told that either.

FT  25 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Laura Ashley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The transformation of Laura Ashley from small family business to closely
scrutinised public concern has been a painfully fraught affair. However,
yesterday's announcement of a second consecutive annual loss may prove the
nadir of the group's fortunes. Much has been achieved over the last year,
not least the overdue closure of its manufacturing plants. Gearing has been
brought under control through the disposal of peripheral assets, the arrival
of new Japanese capital and impressively brutal financial controls. Stock in
the core Laura Ashley business, for example, has been slashed by more than a
fifth.
There is a long way to go before the group can make the most of its prized
asset: an international brand name which covers an enviable product range.
There is still a big marketing challenge to be addressed, notably in
clothing, where the image badly needs bringing up to date. Cost pressures
from rents and wages remain intense, the plight of UK retailers is getting
no better, and the company has still to master the art of dealing with
third-party suppliers.
The shares - up a penny at 80p yesterday - have risen roughly 50 per cent
since late January. At that level, the prospective multiple is more than 20
times for 1992. It will be some years before police horses are again
controlling crowds desperate to throw money at a Laura Ashley issue.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,488.6 (-15.2)
A couple of days ago, the UK chancellor announced that his assessment of the
economy would henceforth rely more heavily on anecdotal surveys of consumer
and business confidence. The latest quarterly survey from the British
Chambers of Commerce will have dampened his spirits accordingly. The level
of home and export orders is plunging faster than ever, in both
manufacturing and services. Expectations on employment and investment are
down again, as is capacity utilisation. Against the odds, there is a modest
revival in business confidence. Significantly, though, it relates more to
sales than to profitability.
There is room for slight scepticism on the findings, since the Chambers of
Commerce survey does not have the same long history as that of the
Confederation of British Industry. But there is no reason to suppose the two
will differ radically. If the CBI confirms the picture in its quarterly
survey next week, the equity market will have to rethink the timing on the
recovery of the UK economy as a whole.
Equally, the chancellor might be tempted to rethink his views on interest
rates. But as luck would have it, sterling is proving a minor casualty in
the battle between the D-Mark and the dollar, besides perhaps suffering from
market nerves ahead of next month's UK local elections. Earlier this week,
it was the second strongest currency in the ERM after the peseta. It has now
fallen to fifth place. There is no real threat from the mooted rise in
German interest rates, since the D-Mark has meanwhile dropped to second
bottom in the system after the French franc. But with sterling now bang in
the middle of its divergence range, it is a risky time for UK rates to move
aggressively the other way.

FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Water meters - a fair but costly option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M. R. HOFFMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr D. A. Fagandini is quite right (Letters, April 20) to point out that
substantial cost savings are possible with a water meter, though much
depends on the size of the property concerned and the customer's
consumption.
Thames Water has regularly told its customers about the meter option. We
give details every year with our billing document and our customer service
staff will offer advice to anyone who calls.
We believe that metering is the fairest option but it would be vastly
expensive to meter all private premises in our region. This is especially
true in London where installation costs could be as high as Pounds l,000 per
property because of the need to separate supply pipes. This should be seen
against an average household's annual bill of Pounds 130 - among the lowest
in the UK, and Europe.
Our price rises - up to 4.5 per cent above inflation for the next five years
 -are necessary to correct years of under-investment. Our aim is to give
customers one of the best water and sewage services in Europe and meet the
highest environmental standards.

FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Quite a time for teenagers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been quite a time for the economic teenagers - those who rush to
dramatic but volatile conclusions on the basis of ephemeral indicators. At
the end of last week there were cries of 'credit crunch' on the basis of a
one-month drop in seasonally adjusted bank lending this March to Pounds
0.7bn (or 0.1 per cent) compared to an average of Pounds 5bn in each of the
preceding six months. A reduction of base rates, we were assured, was now
urgent.
Then on Monday there was the opposite alarm. The volume of retail sales in
March rose by 3.7 per cent above that of February. Now we were told that
base rate reductions must be put on hold in view of the vigorous rebound in
consumer spending.
Both conclusions were of course absurd. Next Tuesday we will have the Bank
of England's analysis of bank lending on a three, six and 12-month basis. It
has already told us that, on any of these bases, narrow money (M0) is well
within, but not below, the government's target range. Broad money, which the
government does not target, has been growing by between 6.8 and 9.9 per cent
per annum - if anything, reassuring compared with the double-digit rates
experienced for so long.
The idea of a retail sales boom is even more absurd than the opposite one of
a credit crunch. The main reason for the March upsurge was, of course, the
desire to beat the April VAT increase. A secondary factor was the early
Easter. On a slightly longer view, sales volume fell smartly in the final
three quarters of 1990 and recovered very slightly in the first quarter of
1991 to end up half a per cent lower than a year ago. In other words, sales
are just about dragging themselves off the bottom.
The trade figures are not now as fashionable as credit and retail sales.
This is partly because the recession has reduced imports, while the
discovery by the Central Statistical Office of hitherto unrealised invisible
earnings has diminished the current deficit by some Pounds 6bn per annum.
Nevertheless, teenagers found the estimated March current deficit of Pounds
432m 'disappointing' and 'double your money'. Why? Because it was twice as
high than February's erratically low deficit and because the so-called
market consensus was for a deficit of Pounds 300m. This latter guess was
simply the average of the previous five months; and the actual shortfall
from it was very well within the normal range of variation. The entire
deterioration is due to a swing from an erratically high surplus in volatile
items, such as aircraft and precious stones in February, to an erratically
low one in March.
If we look at quarterly export volumes, and exclude oil and erratics, they
have been roughly level pegging since the second quarter of 1990, with small
fluctuations in both directions. Imports, on the other hand, have been very
gradually declining with economic activity.
Arguments about the importance or otherwise of the balance of payments will
well up again with economic recovery and will not be stilled until there is
a single European currency and no intra-European payments figures. Roll on
the day.

Sir, You refer to the problems of traffic in densely populated Britain. How
does western Germany, with similar population density but already 30 per
cent more cars, manage to keep its traffic flowing so relatively well, both

If we introduce further costs for motorists which are out of line with our
European competitors, will this not contribute to our economic decline?
What about countries such as the Netherlands with much higher population
densities?

FT  25 APR 91 / Economic Viewpoint: A country with a fix-price culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When unemployment exploded in the early 1980s and then continued to climb
more gradually, ministers suggested that the phenomenon was related to
excessive pay increases. Indeed, the Treasury issued a mustard-coloured
paper, The Relationship between Employment and Wages, in January 1985, with
the unusual by-line 'Review by Treasury Officials', presumably to show
respectability.
Respectable or not, the thesis is true - although there is much room to
argue about how far the trouble is with money wages, how far with real wages
and how far with something more elusive, like real pay objectives.
The Treasury paper, written when ERM was under veto, concentrated on real
pay and estimated that for every 1 per cent it rose above some appropriate
level, employment would fall by  1/2 to 1 per cent (other things being
equal, which they are usually not).
Ministers were, therefore, puzzled and almost embarrassed when unemployment
virtually halved, falling from 11.1 per cent of the workforce in 1986 to a
low of 5.6 per cent in 1990, without any visible wage moderation and indeed
some modest reacceleration as the last boom got going.
The answer to the puzzle is, I am afraid, that part of the fall in
unemployment in the late 1980s was unsustainable. Economists who had no
political axe to grind hesitated to say this for good reasons.
They hoped that there had been a sufficient productivity breakthrough, and
not just a temporary boom-related upsurge, to raise the warranted rate of
pay growth consistent with high employment. They also hoped that the labour
market had become more flexible - that is, more responsive to supply and
demand changes - so that pay would respond to any required application of
the economic brakes without having to endure agonies of massive unemployment
first.
These hopes have obviously proved too optimistic, but more definitely on
labour market flexibility than on productivity. The official estimates
showing annual UK labour cost increases of 11 per cent, based on a 2 per
cent fall in productivity for the whole economy are as suspect as the trade
figures were before the statisticians found missing invisibles (see below).
Productivity has always moved with the business cycle; but the statisticians
may well have underestimated even year-on-year productivity, which the CBI
puts at nearly 4 per cent in manufacturing. Even with that correction,
British labour costs are still rising by about 5 per cent, compared with 1
per cent in Germany.
The real disappointment is that pay should have taken so long to respond to
the slowdown in demand which has been going on for more than two years.
Employers and unions appear to have responded not to fundamentals but to a
backward-looking glance at the headline Retail Prices Index.
There are two aspects of perverse labour markets. One is the rate of
unemployment required to maintain in being any reasonably low and stable
rate of inflation, once it has been achieved (the so-called NAIRU, or
non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). The second relates to the
even higher transitional unemployment costs of moving from one rate of
inflation to a lower one.
Recent academic estimates of the UK NAIRU have varied from 6 per cent to 9
per cent, or 1.8m to 2.5m. Although much too high, it has, if anything, been
slightly less than actual average EC unemployment. The real British disease
has been the even higher transitional unemployment required to achieve each
percentage point reduction in inflation.
The late Sir John Hicks used to distinguish between flex-price and fix-price
economies. Flex-price economies respond to a slackening of demand by
reductions in pay and prices or in their rate of increase. In fix-price
systems, wages and prices have a large inertia and adjustments are made by
means of quantity. Stocks pile up, outside purchases are curtailed, and
workers are laid off.
The UK is by and large a fix-price economy. This is shown not only in the
stickiness of wage inflation, but of price inflation too in many sectors.
Employers respond to difficulties by cutting outside purchases, trimming
staff; but they reduce list prices or wages only as a last resort.
Eventually, of course, prices and margins do get trimmed and pay increases
do come down to what the international competition can justify. But after a
painfully long interval when many jobs have disappeared.
Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs is very likely right in pointing to the
parallel with the corresponding stage of the 1980 recession when both the
headline RPI and pay settlements suddenly fell with astonishing speed - the
latter from 16 1/2 per cent to 9 per cent in the course of the year. This
time Davies expects a drop from 10 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent. The headline
RPI will not, of course, be the basic cause of wage de-escalation, but the
fig-leaf which will be used to justify it.
But what a cost this fall in pay settlements will have exacted on both
occasions. Unemployment is now rising by some 300,000 a quarter and is
likely to be within spitting distance of 3m before the rise tapers off, even
assuming a gradual recovery from recession from mid-year onwards.
Eventually ERM membership should acquire enough credibility to speed up
these adjustments. In any case a change in business culture is as important
as changes in laws and incentives. The Thatcher years may have laid the
ground for this change. But it has not yet happened.

FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: The real roots of poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOF RAYNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a former teacher in a supposedly 'ghetto' area of New York and today
a social services worker in Lambeth, I recognise - and reject - the
diagnosis of the underclass offered by the American academics presented in
Michael Prowse's sympathetic piece, 'The underclass is no illusion' (April
22).
However, if their diagnosis smacks of Thomas Malthus and Samuel Smiles, the
alternative that Prowse offers, that of mass relocation of the poor, also
has roots in a more repressive era. His suggestion of moving people out of
the ghetto en bloc, as was also achieved in 'ghetto' parts of London in the
final quarter of the last century and through urban planning in this, is
merely an act of dispersal and dilution. Sprinkle the poor through those
neighbourhoods with economic abundance, says this theory, and the problems
would be set to right.
But what is wrong with trying to redress - by economic, educationa1 and
other means - the injustices to poor people in the communities in which they
already live, and by activities which encourage their existing survival
structures? Individuals and families do suffer damage by deprivation, but it
has to be said that the problem is not fundamentally the people or even for
that matter, the place. What is missing from communities afflicted by
unemployment, drugs, or other perils, on either side of the Atlantic, is
hope - hope that is associated with individual and group economic progress,
community pride, and legitimacy of social institutions.
Until American policymakers discard Dickensian fantasies about lifestyles of
the poor and start dealing with poverty, they'll be as far off the mark as
their Victorian forebears.

FT  25 APR 91 / Hiccups over monetary growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNIQUES to monitor monetary growth across Europe will be vital to the
operation of the new European central bank, due to be set up during the
final stages of economic and monetary union (Emu). Officials at the Bank of
England, in conjunction with other European central banks, are working on a
novel, highly secret approach to this subject. The FT has stumbled upon a
Bank briefing paper on the project, part of which we reproduce here.
The European Aggregates Targeting (EAT) programme is aimed at finding
monetary indicators that will faithfully monitor changes in the pan-European
economy. That is no mean task, given the range of economic and cultural
conditions across the continent.
Britain's role in EAT can be traced to the mid-1980s. Disillusioned with the
performance of existing monetary aggregates, a small team of Bank officials
started work on a Grand Unifying Theory (GUT) of monetary targeting. The
group explored new thinking that went beyond conventional monetarist
economics. It drew on people skilled not just in this field but in
biochemistry, an area where Britain has a world reputation for innovation.
The GUT team's radical approach paid off with the theory that changes in the
UK money supply could be modelled on genetically-induced interactions during
the digestion of food. The influences of genetic programming on this process
were found to be similar to the way that factors such as wage claims,
unemployment and production efficiencies affect the money supply.
The practical relevance of the GUT ideas was established in a programme of
tests, which used human volunteers with a range of genetic characteristics.
Virtually all aspects to the trials were satisfactory. Outbreaks of
inflation were characterised in the GUT model by localised physiological
disturbences. Ingestion of specific foods accurately simulated external
economic shocks; lobster for an England cricket victory, rice pudding for an
oil-price rise and a well-grilled steak for a broadside from the Bundesbank
on price control.
More quantitatively, the studies held out the prospect of a new regime of
monetary indicators - code-named Biological Universal-Rule Parameters, or
BURPs - which would be far better than any previous monetary aggregates.
Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, was elated with the project's success. But
Mrs Thatcher, then prime minister, was more sceptical; apart from her own
personal disagreements with Mr Lawson, she had little confidence in the
practical capabilities of UK biochemists, whom she had never forgiven for
failing to patent monoclonal antibodies.
After Mr Lawson resigned in 1989, the GUT work foundered - until Mr John
Major took over as prime minister and recognised its significance to Emu. Mr
Major, whose straightforward eating habits based around a liking for ice
cream and brown sauce are well known, was instinctively attracted to the GUT
concept. He also seized upon the work as a demonstration of how Britain
could use its capabilities in the monetary field to the benefit of Europe,
following up the UK's pioneering studies on the hard Ecu currency. After Mr
Major broached the matter over dinner with the other European heads of
state, EAT was born.
EAT has led to the establishment of several loosely linked projects across
Europe. Germany, France and Denmark have led the way with a joint effort,
the Strategic Alliance Aimed at Monetary Indicators (SALAMI). Italy has its
Provisional Attempt at Short-Term Aggregates (PASTA) project, while Spain is
working on the Critical Inflation-Target Reduction Scheme (CITRUS).
EAT has found that, despite the cross-border differences in genetic
programming and eating habits, the same basic theories hold across the
entire continent. Although it is too early to be sure, we can hold out the
hope that ultimately EAT will produce an all-encompassing monetary index for
Europe, provisionally labelled the Highly Operational Target Aimed at
Inflation Reduction, otherwise known as HOTAIR.

FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Sophistication of the Polish consumer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDRE SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Although I am unable to devote the time necessary to refute each point
James Morgan addresses in 'Poland wakes to the day of the deal' (April 13)
let me bring just one of his mis-statements to light. In his attempt to
characterise Polish consumers as unsophisticated and naive, Mr Morgan writes
that Poland is filled with 'goods well past their sell-by dates, which are
incomprehensible to most Poles. The labelling of these goods comes in any
language but Polish'.
For a few weeks last year I conducted an economic experiment by working as a
street-side vendor in Warsaw. After all, how could I claim to offer economic
advise to Poland without a real, first-hand knowledge of the nuts and bolts
of the Polish economy? So I joined the crowd of Polish traders on the night
train to west Berlin, stocked up with several crates of Dutch chocolates,
returned to Warsaw, and set up shop on Marszalkowska Street. The first thing
that virtually every potential customer did was bring my attention to the
expired sell-by date. It was the worldly American who had unwittingly
purchased out-dated merchandise.
Likewise, with the ski jackets I was selling the next week. Although 'Made
in China' does not look much like 'Wyprodukowano w Chinach', it was
universally understandable - and unfortunately not much of a selling point.
It is the clever entrepreneurial spirit of the Poles, not their desire to
cheat and exploit, that will lead to Poland's return to 'western' Europe.

FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Britain's march from a social market economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BRYN JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Marsh ('A hard act for Britain to follow', April 15) is surely
right in identifying a gulf between the German reality of a 'social market
economy' and present arrangements in Britain. It is a pity that he didn't
emphasise the size of that gulf. The Thatcher era has not only left us with
a battlefield of broken 'social' institutions but with brigades of
enterprise warriors force-marching human and capital resources in the
opposite direction from the social market towards the 'free market'.
For example, in the field of vocational training, David Marsh is wrong to
say that Britain is already actively trying to imitate the German 'dual
system'. The core of the latter is the industrial craft apprenticeships for
Facharbeiter (skilled workers), as in the metal-working sectors. British
training has been, and is still being, pushed away from the
Facharbeiter/craft principle of training for broad-based potential
capacities, towards much narrower train-as-you-need-them 'competencies'; a
trend that the government's National Council for Vocational Qualifications
is actively endorsing.
When a British government has to turn social market rhetoric into reality -
if only to keep up with the probable institutional harmonisation for common
EC standards in training and other employment relations - the necessary
U-turn will be on a scale to match the retreat from Moscow.

FT  25 APR 91 / Leading Article: Days of hope in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY, there is hope in Moscow. The statement agreed between the leaders
of nine republics - crucially including Mr Boris Yeltsin of Russia - and Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet president, offers the best possibility in
months for ending the zero-sum games which have been the stock-in-trade of
Soviet politicians.
They have agreed that they must, as soon as possible, sign a new union
agreement, adopt a new union constitution and then hold elections for the
union parliaments and perhaps the union presidency. But with that, they have
explicitly said that those six republics which appear determined to pursue
an independent course and not sign a union agreement, and which did not send
their leaders to Tuesday's meeting, have the right to do so.
At the same time, they warn that those which sign will establish a common
economic space, within which 'most favoured nation' status will prevail. The
implication is that non-signers will be on the same footing as former
fraternal allies in eastern Europe: that is, they can go, but they must then
pay hard currency for Soviet oil, gas and other products. This will be hard,
but it looks like freedom: an end to the 'internal Brezhnev doctrine'.
They have agreed, too, that the anti-crisis programme which Mr Valentin
Pavlov, the prime minister, laid before the Supreme Soviet on Monday will be
supported and that the strikes now paralysing important parts of the Soviet
economy should end. Mr Yeltsin seems ready to lend his authority to the
restoration of industrial peace.
Step forward
This is a big step forward. Most of these republican leaders are
increasingly powerful figures, so the deal, if it sticks, marks both a
further coup for Mr Gorbachev's political skills and an indication of their
own sober sense that they must, in these hardest of times, hang together if
they do not wish to choke separately.
But it is Mr Yeltsin's signature on the document with Mr Gorbachev's which
represents the main political breakthrough. The Russian leader will, in
seven weeks' time, run for the presidency of Russia. His previous
calculation, that his popularity would increase in inverse proportion to the
fall in Mr Gorbachev's seems to have yielded to an appreciation that if he
blows too hard, down will come Gorby, Boris and all. If the two most
powerful politicians in the Soviet Union can suppress their personal dislike
in favour of a political accord with clearly stated aims, the Soviet Union
may have a period in which it can peacefully dis-unite.
Western aid
Such an accord is essential if the country is to receive any of the western
aid, investment and technical assistance it must have.
There is, however, another large question: is the reform which the
republican leaders have agreed to support - the anti-crisis plan - actually
serious? Mr Pavlov says he wants to use the power of the state to effect
necessary sacrifices, steady the currency, balance the budget and increase
production. He has recognised explicitly that a socialist economy with no
fear factor cannot work.
But he also plans (small) privatisations this year and larger ones next. He
urges entrepreneurial behaviour. He has already pushed through price rises,
and has even freed some from state control.
There is much room for doubt. Many - not all - of the radical economists
associated with a more rapid dash for the market distrust Mr Pavlov deeply:
after all, as finance minister, he was responsible for debauching the
currency. He talks too easily of coercion, of states of emergency and of
force.
But if, in the fleshing out of his programme, he really is prepared to
bequeath decision making to the market-oriented republics and, more
importantly, to the enterprises; if he really can provide some space for
market behaviour and not simultaneously woo it and beat it, as Mr Nikolai
Ryzhkov, his predecessor, did; if he can keep the apparatus at bay - then he
may prove to be a reformer after all. And then the Soviet economy may have a
chance, even if it is a slim one.

GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY: IN SEARCH OF A NEW WORLD ETHIC
By Hans Kung
SCM Press Pounds 12.95, 158 pages
This is a small mountain of a book. Its sides are steep and climbed only
with frequent pauses for breath, but the view from the top is worth the
exertion.
The difficulty of the climb stems from the author's ambition. Hans Kung, the
prolific Catholic theologian whose teaching licence was withdrawn by the
Vatican in 1979, uses this short work to outline his plan to spend the
coming years examining the history and theology of Christianity, Judaism and
Islam in pursuit of a secure, ethical basis for world peace. The spirit of
the enterprise is captured in the book's German title: Projekt Weltethos.
What a project]
But this is not a book for a closed theological fraternity. Dedicated to a
former Bundesbank president, one chunk of the thesis was shared with a
momentous meeting of the Davos World Economic Forum in February 1990.
In style, the book swerves between brilliantly compressed summaries of, for
example, theories of world history (Hegel to Toynbee) and slideshow slogans.
Its final words read:
no human life together without a world ethic for the nations;
no peace among the nations without peace among the religions;
no peace among the religions without dialogue among the religions.
Kung's thesis states that 'our new, post-colonialist, polycentric age, in
post-modernity' needs an agreed ethos which only religion can provide;
post-modernism, in his view, set in about 1918. Among its identifying
features are technologies capable both of drawing people together
(telecommunications) and destroying the planet (nuclear weapons and
environmental mis-management). And yet in this world of information
overload, there is a simultaneous tendency for old individualisms, cultures,
nationalisms and religions to re-assert themselves, most powerfully and
obviously in the Islamic world.
Kung accepts that 'those who have no religion can also lead a life which is
authentically human and in this sense moral', but he argues that without
religion there is no absolute or unconditional reason to adhere to or to
require adherence to religion's essential tenets: don't kill, don't lie,
don't steal, respect parents, love children and avoid immorality. Only
religion, he says, has shown itself capable of leading and influencing whole
populations, regardless of background and education.
Although Kung's unmistakably central European timbre betrays a hint of the
evangelist, he makes a specific pitch for unbelievers to join this great
dialogue on the grounds that even if you resist the claims of belief, you
cannot deny the political and social importance of the fact that millions do
believe.
Kung thus seeks at once to be open-minded, but loyal to his own creed:
steadfastness and self-criticism are the essential qualities he identifies
for the task ahead.
What, though, is the common threat which binds the great religions? For
Kung, the answer is 'the humanum', or basic human values. 'Religion,' he
writes, 'is true and good to the degree that it serves humanity, to the
degree that . . . it advances men and women in their identity, sense of
meaning and sense of dignity, and allows them to attain a meaningful and
fruitful existence.' The thread is thus clearly aspiration rather than
achievement, and perhaps even as aspiration it is too much the work of a
post-Englightenment European mind to carry the weight the author gives it.
It would be wrong, however, to imply that Kung is unaware of the
Eurocentricity of his intellectual heritage. He rejects both Hegel's and
Spengler's seminal theories of history partly on the grounds that they
ignore or marginalise Judaism and Islam. Arnold Toynbee, the British
historian, is viewed more favourably, but still found wanting in his groping
for some synthesised 'world religion'. Kung is surely right to recognise
that religions will remain stubbornly factional; the best that can be hoped
is that they learn to love dialogue more than they enjoy militancy.
As we look from Prof Kung's mountain top, it is not surprising to see
patches of haze. In his opening survey of the state of the world, for
example, he dismisses Japanese moral and spiritual life with a
superficiality which seems over-influenced by newspaper stories about recent
scandals in politics and business.
But mostly, we should be thankful for Hans Kung and his motivating judgment,
that religion remains decisive in human affairs and that peace, if it is to
be found anywhere, lies along the road of intelligent and well-researched
dialogue. Kung, an antidote to the conservatism of the current Vatican, is
the kind of intellectual the late 20th century needs; thorough, engaged and
with a global perspective.
Towards the end of the book, he mentions in passing the great protestant
theologian, Paul Tillich, who gave a lecture in Chicago in 1965, recognising
the need to re-work a lifetime of systematic theology in the light of his
emerging understanding of world religion. Ten days later, he died. As Kung
approaches his mid-sixties, with Projekt Weltethos before him, we can only
wish him a long and active old age.

FT  25 APR 91 / Arts: Ten new productions for Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new principal conductor and ten new productions for 1991-92 were announced
yesterday by the newly ebullient Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Edward
Downes is taking over on September 1 as principal conductor from Jeffrey
Tate. He will also function as associate music director, making life easier
for Bernard Haitink.
These days 'new' productions tend to have started life in some foreign opera
house, but five of next season's repertoire will actually have been created
in the House. They are Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, conducted for the first
time by Georg Solti and directed by Elijah Moshinsky; a very early Mozart,
Mitrodate, re di Ponti, which opens on the actual centenary of his death in
December, and a very established Mozart, Don Giovanni; a new production of
Wagner's Die Fliegende Hollander to replace the one recently booed off the
stage; and the first British professional staging of Rossini's comic opera
Il viaggio a Reims.
The five 'bought in' productions are Prokofiev's The Fiery Angel, never
previously staged at Covent Garden; Das Rheingold, to complete the new Ring
cycle; Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots; Bellini's I Puritani (the WNO production);
and Britten's last opera, Death in Venice.
The general director of Covent Garden, Jeremy Isaacs, also placated his
critics by announcing that he was asking many of the members of the chorus
aged over 50 to take early retirement.
The Minister for the Arts, Timothy Renton, has asked the Arts Council to
come up with savings of Pounds 1m on its devolution programme by May 17. He
is unhappy with the few savings that have accrued so far from the policy of
creating Regional Arts Boards with enhanced responsibilities.
So far out of a total Arts Council and RAB payroll of around 500 only 35
jobs are to be lost through the rationalisation. The Minister wants a 10 per
cent cut in the payroll bill.
Mr Renton has approved the first Arts Council list of 28 devolved arts
organisations but it is remarkable for the general unimportance of the
companies involved. It includes Aldeburgh, going to Eastern Arts, and
Northern Sinfonia, to Northern Arts. There is no mention of the big four
London orchestras, the ICA, the Royal Court, or Manchester Exchange, all
once earmarked for devolution.
It could well be that Tim Renton is not so keen as the Arts Council on
devolution. The new Boards are being recruited but they start life, on
October 1, not knowing whether they will handle the really major arts
companies.

<TEXT>
Vaut le voyage, says the guidebook; or vaut le detour. Not for Rambert's new
programme when you have to negotiate the horrors of Hammersmith Broadway.
And not, alas, for the way the troupe is performing this season. It may be
that the adjustment to an open space from a routine of proscenium
appearances has thrown the dancers off balance, but the company style looks
to me less polished and purposeful than of late years. A notable exception
on Tuesday night was Amanda Britton, who appeared in Richard Alston's Soda
Lake. This solo in silence is inspired by Nigel Hall's sculpture, which in
turn was inspired by the austere and isolated forms of a dry lake in the
Mojave desert. Miss Britton, with her wonderful linear qualities and clear,
fluent phrasing, makes a very fine impression in a piece that has previously
been danced by men. She reveals the watchful stillness of the piece in
movement that is beautifully poised, responding to the two austere metal
forms that are the sculpture (like a telegraph pole and a skeletal tree)
with images no less pure and controlled.
The novelty of the evening was the first performance of William Tuckett's
Slippage, fruit of funding from the Ashton Memorial Commission. Tuckett is
just starting to make his way as a choreographer with creations for both
halves of the Royal Ballet. He is still young, and I am not persuaded that
the chance to compose for a modern dance troupe is the best means of
extending his skills. For Slippage he has chosen a score of minimalist
chatter by Dan Jones, music that provides nothing to sustain choreographic
invention save the dubious merit of continuing to do what it has already
done at interminable length. The chief incidents of the piece amount to the
dancers peeling off layers of clothes - dull, and by Candida Cook - to
reveal themselves in dreary underwear (one chap looks like Captain Webb
about to embark upon the English Channel).
The dance, like the score, goes on. Four couples leap and walk, droop and
race over the stage, and part of the choreography has the innocent
springiness I associate with revivals of the sacred texts of early Denishawn
dance of 60 years ago. It is decent, and unmemorable, and Tuckett has
already shown us that he can do better things than this.
The problems of the Riverside space were very apparent in the revival of
Richard Alston's Dealing with Shadows. It is a piece altogether too
sprightly about a Mozart piano sonata, but when it was first seen at
Sadler's Wells last year, ebullient performance gave it a superficial charm.
In its present setting it looks diffuse and garrulous, and the choice of
printed tops and beach trunks as costume makes the dancers seem like
gigantic babies. The visual record of this season has not been happy.

FT  25 APR 91 / Arts: Frederick Douglass - New Jersey State Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newark is a romantic and vital place, easily reached from New York by
overground or underground train, architecturally explorable, ethnically
diverse. The biggest Portuguese community outside Lisbon lives there.
Italians abound. And opera in Newark is attended by an eager audience in
which English is the last language overheard.
The only big new opera to have been staged in or around New York this season
is Ulysses Kay's Frederick Douglass, which was put on by the New Jersey
State Opera for a single performance in Newark's Town Hall. It's a grand
Roman theatre, seating 2,700. One of the company's specialities is verismo -
Iris, Lodoletta, Zanetto, L'amico Fritz - performed under a conductor,
Alfredo Silipigni, who knows the traditions. Another is loyalty to singers
abandoned by the Met: it was in Newark that I heard Birgit Nilsson sing her
last Turandot, with Licia Albanese as Liu; and an Attila with Jerome Hines.
This season a Carmen with Fiorenza Cossotto was billed, but it fell through.
So did the second performance of a star-cast Lombardi, Bergonzi the tenor; I
made the trek to Newark only to find a 'Performance cancelled' sign on the
door. Money had run out, as in this country it is running out for musical
enterprise of all kinds.
But Frederick Douglass reached the stage, if only for a single performance.
The Mayor of Newark, Sharpe James,appeared as a super. I wish I could write
that it was a triumph; instead, I can find nothing to praise. I thought it
an incompetent opera. Douglass - a hundred years ago this identifying would
not be necessary - was an escaped slave whose oratory and whose published
Narrative (Penguin keeps it in print) stirred both the US and Europe. The
Narrative tells of a youth whose free, active mind rejected the notion that
he and his fellows should be lifelong a white man's owned chattels. William
Garrison, the great abolitionist, wrote truly that 'he who can peruse it
without a tearful eye, a heaving breast, an afflicted spirit, must have a
flinty heart.'
David Blake's Toussaint, Thea Musgrave's Harriet, and Anthony Davis's X have
given differing examples of how such matter can be more worthily treated. By
comparison with those operas, Frederick Douglass seems cheap and unworthy.
Kay and his librettist, Donald Dorr, concocted a clumsy, long-winded drama -
untrue to history, crudely and conventionally 'operatic', wholly
unconvincing - about how Douglass in his last years, ambassador to Haiti,
was brought low by a conspiracy of Washingtonians resentful of a black man's
eminence. Donizetti and Verdi would had have rejected it as ineffectual.
The libretto is poetastry, and Kay's music drones on and on in Puccinian
arioso without Puccini's command of melodic gesture. Kevin Maynor sang the
title role, and the veteran dramatic soprano Klara Barlow was Mrs Douglass.
Should we hail the show as homage to an elderly black composer (Kay was born
in 1917), or deplore it as time, money and talent spent on something
artistically worthless and unworthy?

FT  25 APR 91 / Arts: The Seagull - Lilian Baylis Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE ARMITSTEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most obvious feature of Mike Alfreds' version of The Seagull for the
Oxford Stage Company is that it looks extraordinary, not because of any
design-led flight of fancy but because of its conception of the people
involved. The members of Chekhov's country house party appear like a cross
between the background interest in a Renoir painting and a convention of
Lithuanian nationalists. The men sport big-bottomed beards; the women are
simply big-bottomed. Even the luckless seagull, bagged by the fretful
Konstantin, is an albatross in all but name.
Biggest and brashest of all is Pam Ferris, whose Arkadina is no elegant
Muscovite, bestowing her refined presence on her country estate, but a
corpulent diva with an all-engulfing presence, who erupts into unconfined
temper tantrums and as quickly erupts out of them again. When she steps on
to her son's rickety little stage, after ridiculing his play off it, the
structure shakes under her weight, its little proscenium arch no match for
her voluminous coiffure.
One can well imagine her appeal to a restless spirit like Trigorin, who
could simply bury his sense of inadequacy in her massive bulk; likewise, she
makes it woefully clear why her son, Konstantin, has never grown up. Michael
Mueller presents a man spiritually and materially squashed by a mother who
bandages his head one minute and hurls insults at him the next. 'While I'm
away, you won't go click-click again,' she beseeches him. It is the nearest
she gets to acknowledging his desperation, her choice of childish euphemism
underlining her childlike refusal to face his attempted suicide.
The refusal is so complete that it makes a charade of her attempt to prevent
Trigorin from leaving her for the younger Nina. This central scene, which
anchors the characterisation of Arkadina to a sense that her day is past,
loses its meaning when it is played by an emotional illiterate. She weeps,
bullies and finally, having reduced Trigorin to hopeless tears, bustles off
with a smug smile on her face, her sense of her own importance confirmed.
Alfreds' preoccupation with grandiloquence of emotion and gesture creates a
sore problem for Irena Brook, whose visually lovely Nina - a gift for the
declamation of Konstantin's sweet nothings - signally fails to gather the
required stature along the way. Her reappearance, a fallen woman, in the
final act is certainly not the stuff of tragedy as Arkadina would know it;
this haggard little slip is merely pathetic - and rather less so than
Caroline Quentin's slatternly Masha, whose capacity for melodramatising her
misery gives her a sombre momentum.
So what of the men? One is tempted to leave them till last because they are
so entirely dwarfed by the women. Nicholas Clay builds the character of the
usually urbane Trigorin around a sphynx-like smile into his beard, as if the
successful writer is lost for the appropriate words. It is as hard to
imagine him indulging a casual amour as it is to envisage Roger Frost's
skinny schoolmaster fathering Masha's family, or Ric Morgan's brusque doctor
sustaining a 20-year liaison with Dawn Keeler's fluttery Polina. It is all
interesting and different enough, until one starts to look for the
Chekhovian heart.

'If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear as it is,
infinite.'
It was astute of William Blake, a film critic before his time, to associate
the notion 'doors' with the notion 'infinite.' Oliver Stone's film The Doors
seems infinite, though it lasts a mere 141 minutes. Yet it shows not the
remotest perception of what was 'infinite' in the Blake-ian sense about The
Doors' music. Even I, a non-rockomane, recognise in Jim Morrison's
broody-thunderous songs a power born of some pyromaniac vision in the soul.
Stone's vision is the same as the one he brought to Platoon and Born On The
Fourth Of July. Well-upholstered hyperbole drives on the story, with a few
tinny morals attached like cans to a wedding car. Drug-prone
composer-vocalist Morrison, though played and sung with spitting-image
similitude by Val Kilmer, is presented as a messiah in search of martyrdom.
Society is out to get him, but who in this film is 'him'? No human being
dwells inside the mad eyes and the marijuana'd wisecracks. ('I don't
remember being born,' he tells a reporter, 'it must have been during one of
my blackouts'). This Morrison was a bio-pic legend even before he was born.
The whole film starts with the assumption of immortality then tries to climb
higher into Rock Era inspirationalism. Socking on through concert after
concert (mixing real and staged footage), traversing ever dottier sexual
skirmishes with girlfriend Meg Ryan or groupie Kathleen Quinlan ('Have you
ever tried drinking blood?'), the story's ascent is interrupted only by the
odd dutiful attempt to 'explain' Morrison. He may have been traumatised as a
child by the sight of a roadside accident (cue surreally bleached
flashback). Or he may have been a free soul spurred to revolt by society's
moral pressures or the Vietnam war or . . . What the hell. Suffice it that
he is a genius and the film is two hours of designer idolatry. Stone's
Steadicam powers on through rock stadiums and hotel corridors, tracking
after its hero like a mad lepidopterist chasing a butterfly.
Occasionally the headlong chase yields a glimpse of some Elysian
possibility. The film could have been a pop-world mockumentary in the style
of This Is Spinal Tap, but its funny lines are strictly unintentional. ('I
had enough of this shit with Janis,' screams a studio manager at a
misbehaving Morrison). It could have confined itself to what it does best:
re-constructing the concerts via fact and fiction. Stone comes into his
barnstorming own here: the thousands of extras are whipped into a plausible
frenzy, as the air crackles to 'Come on, baby, light my fire' or 'This is
the end.' At these moments Morrison-fever means something. Elsewhere in The
Doors it means only Hollywood's latest bid to be with it by jumping on a
bandwagon that vanished 20 years ago.
White Palace starts out as a steamy slice of erotic life only to end up a
soggy May-December romance. Max (James Spader) is an effete Yuppie adman who
is emotionally scarred by the accidental death of his wife. He seems
destined for a life of tortured celibacy until he meets Nora (Susan
Sarandon), a brassy hamburger waitress 16 years his senior. Against all the
odds, the two fall madly in love, bonded not only by intense sexual desire
but also by shared tragedy - Nora lost her teenage son to drugs. Their first
few dates see them proceeding all the way from the sofa to the waterbed,
with Nora using her considerable skills and experience to draw Max out of
his cocoon of impotent self-pity.
So fa so good. In these opening scenes director Lius Mandoki elicits the
film's erotic tension with a steady, stylish hand. Spader's unctuous
self-containment, reminiscent of his fine performance in sex, lies and
videotape, is perfect for his character, while Sarandon is eminently
believable as a woman determined to keep middle age at bay by sheer sensual
will. Unfortunately, their energy flags about a half-hour into the film,
transforming it into a quirky love story far less engrossing than the
initial pyrotechnics promised. There's a squabble over a vacuum cleaner, an
embarrassing visit by Nora's clairvoyant sister (Eileen Brennan), and the
inevitable confrontation when Max brings his older, declasse girl home to
meet family and friends. Sarandon is much less convincing making impassioned
pleas for the working class to Spader's smug relations than she is showing
him the sensual ropes. After all this soppy domesticity, it comes as little
surprise that heir final reconciliation is sealed with a chaste, public
kiss, in which eroticism is joked about rather than explored.
It also comes as little surprise that Bill Murray plays a robber in Quick
Change. There can be few more apt roles for one of modern cinema's most
adept scene stealers. In fact, everything about this light, engaging comedy
suits Murray perfectly, lending him a perfect vehicle for his wry asides and
deadpan double-takes. He plays an ambitious thief who, with the help of a
clown suit, a sexy girlfriend (Geena Davis) and a doltish sidekick (Randy
Quaid), pulls off what just might be the perfect bank heist. Unfortunately,
the one thing that he doesn't take into account is making his getaway
through New York City, portrayed here as a thoroughly moronic inferno.
Maniacal bus drivers, lovelorn Mafia wiseguys and urban jousters conspire to
turn a simple trip to Kennedy Airport into a tortuous adventure.
Murray deadpans his way through it all with consummate skill, particularly
in the opening scenes when he takes over the bank. Despite attempts at
broadening his character with hints of a traumatic Vietnam past and a
romantic entanglement with Davis, he never stops being Bill Murray, even
when hidden behind a fright wig and white face. Everybody else - including
New York - plays off him with varying degrees of success. His fans will not
be disappointed.
Fans of the triumvirate headlining Scenes from a Mall - Paul Mazursky, Woody
Allen and Bette Midler - will be less satisfied. Everything is in place here
for a wonderful comedy, with the veteran satirist Mazursky directing Allen
and Midler as a successful Beverly Hills couple (she's a best-selling author
of psychobabble, he's a sports lawyer) publicly feuding their way through
their 16th wedding anniversary. The movie is strangely flat, however,
despite an occasionally trenchant script by the director and Roger L. Simon.
The problem, surprisingly, is with the leads, who suffer from a
disappointing lack of chemistry. When mixed, these two potent and precious
elements fizzle out rather than ignite. Allen bravely plays against his
usual screen persona, sporting a pony tail and singing the praises of Los
Angeles, but is never altogether convincing. Nor is Midler, whose frenetic
mastery is only sometimes glimpsed, such as when she publicly pelts her
wayward husband with sushi. For the most part, she's as subdued and aimless
as the picture itself.
It's a shame that Wings of Fame isn't a bit more subdued. In it, Peter
O'Toole plays a pompous actor who is gunned down by a deranged fan (Colin
Firth). When the assassin perishes as well, their spirits are barged to the
netherworld, depicted here as a posh island hotel inhabited by famously dead
souls. It is a last resort of sumptuous comfort and profound ennui -
Hemingway shoots clay pigeons, Einstein saws away at his fiddle, even Lassie
makes an appearance, lurking in the bushes. All wait in dread of the moment
when their earthly fame runs out and they will be consigned to the much less
cozy mists of oblivion.
Despite the overblown symbolism of hooded boatmen, cadaverous bellhops and
blindfolded archers, writer/director Otakar Votocek has a simple point to
make - in a godless world, fame is the only form of immortality going. He
would have fared far better to ease up on the skewered allegory and focus on
the complex relationship between O'Toole and Firth, who both labour
heroically to salvage the film from its pretensions. O'Toole is
characteristically dissolute and charming, maintaining his legendary poise
even in a film that sends him to Hell and back.

FT  25 APR 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Jockeying for
position - The battle in the TV listings market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until March 1 this year the market for television listings magazines in the
UK was a market like few others, quaint even by British standards. All over
the rest of Europe a diversity of listings magazines, some countries with as
many as 30, is normal.
Yet in Britain there was only the Radio Times for BBC programmes and later
on TV Times for commercial television. Each jealously guarded its monopoly
and sued any publisher which broke it. The only limited exception was for
newspapers - they could print weekday schedules 24 hours in advance, 48
hours at weekends.
The listings duopoly was nearly overturned by the Monopolies Commission in
1985. The commission found that the listings duopoly was anti-competitive
but, on the casting vote of the chairman, Sir Godfray Le Quesne, strangely
it found that it was not against the public interest. A suggestion by the
commission that other publishers should be able to get the information under
licence was ignored.
The drama intensified in December 1988 when the European Commission ruled
that the titles of programmes should be freely available. A year later the
then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd denounced 'the dotty duopoly' and set the
beginning of last month as the date for opening up the market.
Partly because of the government's own Copyright Act which strengthened the
concept of intellectual property, the 'dotty duopoly' could not be
overturned entirely.
In future, however, the broadcasters had to make the listings available to
any other legitimate publisher under licence - a licence they could charge
for.
For the first time the British viewing public is able to get all its
programme schedules - BBC, commercial television, satellite and cable -
under one cover.
The controversy is, however, far from over. Companies such as ITP,
publishers of TV Times and What's On TV, are threatening to take the BBC to
court in the UK and to Brussels for abusing its dominant position by using
its own airtime to promote its magazines such as Radio Times.
Newspapers are also angry because they now have to pay for listings material
that once was free - some weekly papers are even boycotting programme
listings because they cannot afford them.
Formal complaints have been made to the Copyright Tribunal, the body that
will adjudicate on fair rates for listings.
It's all a long way from the hopes of the original campaigners who argued
that publicity for television programmes benefited broadcasters and that
programme details should simply be available for free.

brownie points - A government/commerce approach to road safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Malcolm Rifkind, the UK's transport minister, launched a campaign this
week aimed at improving safety for child cyclists, Halfords basked in the
glow of its public-spiritedness.
The motor accessories retailer is one of several companies to take advantage
of the opportunities offered by the Department of Transport to enhance their
corporate image by helping to promote road safety.
This year the DoT is raising the amount spent on road safety publicity from
Pounds 4.75m to Pounds 6m. Since last year, campaigns on subjects ranging
from drink-driving to aircraft security have all come under the Safety on
the Move umbrella.
An important element is the initiative on child safety which concentrates on
two big campaigns a year. The first of these last autumn featured Texaco's
'Children should be seen and not hurt' campaign.
For the companies involved, the return on their investment - which typically
includes disseminating literature and providing equipment at cost - cannot
be measured in terms of profit on the promoted item promoted. It could,
however, be argued that the products resemble loss leaders and win it more
customers.
Instead, they count on a boost to their image. 'We get the benefit of being
associated with a government campaign. We are seen to be responsible
retailers,' says Hugh Birley, a spokesman for Halfords.
The DoT is not shy in extracting some benefit for consumers in return for
the companies' public earning of brownie points. In Halfords' case it
suggested that the retailer might supply helmets for child cyclists at a
more accessible price than the usual Pounds 23 to Pounds 24. For the offer
period, the helmet will be sold for Pounds 14.99, the wholesale price.
There are, however, limits to the closeness of the relationship between
government and the commercial concern. The department is keen to dispell any
impression that it is using taxpayers' money to help a company's advertising
campaign.
No product is endorsed - 'we don't say buy this or buy that' - nor are there
any exclusive arrangements. For instance, Mothercare and Elastoplast are
also involved in the child cyclist campaign.
Because of the delicacy of the relationship, Miller &amp; Leeves WAHT, the
advertising agency used by the DoT, is careful which companies are invited
to take part. Peter Jones, the director responsible, says: 'Part of our
remit is to find companies interested in the marketing of road safety.'
One company Jones describes as having a suitable track record is Kwik-Fit,
the tyre and exhaust company. It is contributing to publicity about new
legislation which, from July 1, will make it compulsory for adult back-seat
car passengers to wear safety belts.
The law applying to children came into force in 1989, when Kwik-Fit mounted
its original 'Belt up in the Back' campaign.
Peter Holmes, marketing director of the Edinburgh-based company, says it
first ventured into the safety area in 1987 when it launched its offer to
fit toddler safety seats for Pounds 34.90, with the promise to take back the
seat and refund the money once the child had reached the age of four.
The rear seat-belt legislation, however, can only go so far; it can only be
enforced if the belts are already fitted and the DoT estimates that a third
of the UK's 19m cars do not have them. Part of Kwik-Fit's role will be to
offer a fitting service.

FT  25 APR 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): TV schedules
publishing wars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fiercest marketing battle for 30 years has broken out in the once sedate
world of publishing television programme schedules.
This has been generated by the British government's decision to end the
duopoly of programme listings held by TV Times and the BBC's Radio Times.
The market, at least in theory, is now open to any publisher willing to pay
for the information under licence.
As a result, the established titles and the new entrants are jockeying for
position and market share; as much as Pounds 20m has been spent on
advertising and promotion.
There has even been the first casualty - one of the new entrants, TV Plus,
collapsed after only three issues. Some potential players didn't even make
it to the starting line; the Daily Telegraph closed its television magazine
7 Days before deregulation and Rupert Murdoch's candidate, the British
version of the US TV Guide veered off to concentrate on satellite TV
programmes.
'This market is not for the faint-hearted,' says John Matthews, managing
director of Independent Television Publications - with more than a touch of
understatement. ITP is the publisher of TV Times and a cheaper entrant to
the market, What's On TV.
Until March 1 viewers who wanted advanced listings had to pay 50p each for
TV Times and the Radio Times. Just over 3m households regularly bought a
programme journal; about 88 per cent of them bought both. This amounted to
only 15 per cent of households with a television compared with 80 per cent
in the Netherlands, 30 per cent in France and 28 per cent in Italy.
In the UK now there are four paid-for magazines giving all the programmes
including those on satellite; at least two more are under consideration.
Britain's two leading popular newspapers, The Sun and the Daily Mirror, now
include special listings supplements in Saturday's editions which cover the
whole week's programmes.
But this has potentially tricky consequences; circulation on Saturdays has
increased but sales for the rest of the week have gone down. Robert Maxwell,
the publisher of Mirror Group Newspapers, says that he will review the
situation in two months.
Time Out magazine has seen a significant increase in circulation since it
has been carrying full TV listings. The full week's listings are also
available in the popular celebrity magazine, Hello.
But the publication to have made the most significant entry to the scene
comes from the German publisher, H Bauer. Having scored two successes in the
UK women's weekly market with Bella and Take A Break, and planned its move
for nearly two years, Bauer then sat out the first four weeks of the
liberalised market before launching TV Quick with all guns blazing.
'We really wanted to be sure that the product was absolutely right before we
launched,' says Alan Urry, managing director of Bauer in the UK, who
explains that the company had wanted to allow a little of the dust to
settle.
Some of that dust settled on TV Plus which, after an estimated initial sale
of 500,000, sank to 220,000 and closed; Hamfield Publications, the company
behind it, went into receivership before TV Quick even appeared. Bauer aimed
TV Quick unashamedly at the mass market with a cut-throat cover price of 10p
for its first four weeks and backed it with a saturation television
advertising campaign.
The strategy behind the pricing policy was to get as many people as possible
to sample the magazine; it seems to have achieved its objective. Between
1.85m and 1.9m were sold of the first two issues, giving TV Quick an early
lead over both TV Times and Radio Times.
According to Urry, between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m was spent on the launch.
For its first four weeks, Bauer gave the 10p straight to the newsagents,
paid the wholesalers a distribution fee and shouldered the entire production
costs without revenue. The true test of its circulation will come when TV
Quick charges an economic price that Urry says will be between 35p and 45p.
Over at ITP, Matthews has also placed considerable emphasis on price-cutting
as a device to draw attention to the fact that TV Times now has news of all
TV programmes. For the first three weeks of the new competitive era TV Times
halved its cover price to 25p.
Radio Times was forced to respond - but John Thomas, managing director of
BBC Publications did not cut the magazine's cover price - although the
effect for the consumer was similar. The BBC seized on the fact that the
second week after deregulation coincided with Comic Relief, when comedians
and the public raise money for charity. The Corporation announced that
during the last two weeks of the special offer at TV Times the BBC would
donate half its 50p cover price to Comic Relief.
'We were absolutely appalled that TV Times cut its price - thus devaluing a
very well established brand in the marketplace,' Thomas argues. But TV
Times's Matthews says the price reduction was both planned and necessary and
was a strategy that worked.
The second string to ITP's bow grew out of research which showed that while
many consumers wanted detailed programme information, others wanted their
listings in a more concentrated form.
To meet this latter market and to try to extend the company's market share,
What's On TV, complete with a free TV planner board with the first issue,
was launched. What's on TV began at a discount price of 25p and had a single
week at 35p before having to match TV Quick's 10p cover price.
After a total ITP promotional spend of Pounds 10m by week six What's on TV
had a circulation of around 600,000 and TV Times claims its circulation was
1.7m, down from 3.1m before deregulation.
Falls in circulation of both TV Times and Radio Times were expected as
double buying of the titles fell away; the BBC says Radio Times sales fell
from 2.16m to 1.72m. The Corporation's promotional costs were about Pounds
5m including more than Pounds 1m spent on commercial television. It also had
considerable support on BBC television channels.
Thomas believes deregulation is leading to a polarisation of the market. The
BBC claims that more than 50 per cent of Radio Times readers are ABCIs, the
professional and managerial classes, compared with a TV Times figure in the
mid-30s. 'We think the UK public is realising what this is all about; there
is now an opportunity to increase the market not through pyrotechnics but
through careful promotion to distinct segments,' says Thomas.
He has researched a new listings title which could be launched later this
year, but refuses to say at which sector of the market it would be aimed.
ITP, too, has plans for a third title - a glossy upmarket magazine - but no
decision has yet been taken on whether to bring them to fruition.
Thomas says he would be amazed if another mainstream British publisher were
to enter the market now 'with the blood still drying on the wall', although
further interest from non-UK publishers could not be ruled out.
In two or three years' time when the market has settled down, Matthews
forecasts there will be five paid-for listings magazines in the UK with
total sales of more than 6m, 1m more than at present - a far cry from the
last time all Britain's broadcasting listings were available in a single
magazine: the Radio Times of the 1950s sold more than 10m copies a week.

FT  25 APR 91 / Technology: A crackdown on originality - Beginning a series
on innovation in the recession, Charles Leadbeater looks at how the economic
climate has affected investment in research and development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bombarded by the pressures of recession British managers might be forgiven
for putting plans for innovation to one side. But they would be gambling
with their company's future.
As the director of one of the UK's leading electronics companies puts it:
'We cut back research and development for 1988. We are still reaping the
harvest of this decision, which has left us 1.5 product generations behind
the competition. We are faced with the choice of leapfrogging generations or
getting out of the business.'
Innovation is becoming increasingly central to competition. It is no longer
enough to produce low-cost, high-quality items. Product ranges must be
renewed constantly to take advantage of the quickening pace of technological
change and create distinctive products which can command a niche in
international markets.
The Confederation of British Industry's Innovation Trends survey* published
on Monday showed that UK companies have had little success in reducing the
time it takes them to develop new products. Yet the need for new products is
becoming more pressing. Companies reporting that the lifespan for their
products had shortened outweighed those who said it had lengthened by almost
10 to one. About 40 per cent said they needed to replace their product
ranges within three years.
The innovative capacity of an economy is a key index of its strength. The
impact of the recession upon the UK's innovative potential will have
implications for the health of the economy long after the recession is
formally declared over. Cuts in investment in 1990-91 might allow dividends
to be maintained in the teeth of recession. But by the mid-1990s companies
may find their product development pipelines have run dangerously dry.
Britain entered the recession with a record for innovation which was at best
mixed. The main source of industry's renewed competitiveness in the last
decade was a leap in productivity. Between 1980 and 1987 output per person
employed in the UK rose in real terms by 24 per cent, compared with 22 per
cent in Japan, between 12 per cent and 14 per cent in Germany, Italy and
France and about 7 per cent in the US. But have British manufacturers become
more efficient at developing new products?
A House of Lords select committee report** published earlier this year says
that many UK manufacturers invest too little in new or improved products,
plants or systems. 'They rely on doing what they have done in the past and
fail to seize new opportunities created by changing customer demand. As a
result their competitiveness declines.'
Gross domestic expenditure on research and development fell in the UK
between 1981 and 1988, but rose in France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US.
Public spending on R&amp;D fell markedly while industry spending rose from about
1.2 per cent of GDP to about 1.25 per cent. This compares with a rise in
German industry's expenditure from 1.4 per cent of GDP to 1.8 per cent.
British electronics groups such as GEC have been criticised for avoiding
technologically important areas such as the mass production of
semiconductors. In retrospect this looks like a sensible decision as all the
big European semiconductor manufacturers - Siemens of Germany, Philips of
the Netherlands and SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian joint venture - are
losing money hand over fist on chips.
At best Britain's relative technological decline may have been arrested. It
has definitely not been reversed and there are signs that it has continued.
Is the British innovation system strong enough to withstand the battering of
recession?
Over the last 15 months the outlook for innovation has deteriorated in line
with the fall in confidence among manufacturers, according to the CBI. In
October 1989 a balance of about 35 per cent of manufacturers expected to
increase their expenditure upon innovation in the year ahead. By January of
this year the balance had turned negative - more companies expected to
reduce their expenditure than those expecting to increase it.
Yet it seems possible that innovation may not be cut back as far as other
costs and the cuts will fall unevenly across the economy. Throughout last
year manufacturers remained quite bullish about their spending on innovation
even though they had become deeply pessimistic about the business outlook.
This may mean that innovation spending could get away with a shave rather
than a cut, as long as confidence recovers soon (see graph).
Moreover cuts in innovation are likely to be spread unevenly across the
economy. The recession will widen the gap between those sectors where
Britain has well-established strengths, built upon heavy research and
development spending, and those where it is weak because it has
underinvested in the past. The recession will amplify the difference between
these two sectors.
Chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers are the most buoyant about the
outlook for innovation. A positive balance of 20 per cent of companies in
the chemicals sector still expect to spend more on innovation in the coming
year. Only 18 per cent think their spending is less than adequate. The UK
entered the recession with a strong position in chemicals and
pharmaceuticals and is likely to retain it.
In contrast the mechanical engineering sector is among the weakest in
manufacturing, with one of the poorest investment records in the 1980s. In
this sector the outlook for innovation is poor. A negative balance of 10 per
cent of companies expect to spend less on innovation. About 44 per cent of
companies believe their innovation spending is inadequate. This sector will
be made weaker by the recession.
Yet it would be complacent to assume that areas of traditional strength will
escape unscathed. The defence-related areas of aerospace and electronics are
cases in point. Within the overall recession is a specific defence recession
brought on by cuts in military expenditure.
Defence accounts for 51 per cent of UK government spending on research and
development and 20 per cent of total UK research and development. Defence is
one of Britain's specialisms. Military research feeds much of the civil
aerospace and electronics industries. Thus the British innovation system
will be particularly hit by cuts in defence-related research.
A development which may counterbalance the decline in defence is the
increase in foreign investment in innovation in the UK. The share of British
R&amp;D accounted for by foreign companies rose from 4 per cent in 1967 to 13
per cent in 1986. In areas such as consumer electronics and automobile
assembly the UK has become almost wholly dependent upon foreign groups. In
the long run the prospects for innovation in the UK will increasingly turn
upon whether large foreign groups choose to complement their UK
manufacturing plants with research facilities.
Small companies may fare worse than larger groups. The CBI survey found that
45 per cent of companies which employ fewer than 50 people felt their
spending on innovation was inadequate, compared with 30 per cent of
companies employing between 1,000 and 5,000.
Innovation is the product of a complex process involving a range of
ingredients. It seems likely that companies will cut back on some elements
of innovation, while continuing to invest in others. According to the CBI,
in manufacturing as a whole investment in formal R&amp;D will fall this year.
Yet there could be an expansion in the resources devoted to other elements
of innovation such as training. David Lees, chairman and chief executive of
GKN, the automotive and industrial services group, says: 'In 1980 we cut
back on training. This time we will not do that.'
Joint ventures with foreign companies are set to expand. About 50 per cent
of manufacturers are planning to put more effort into joint ventures which
bring access to technology, according to the CBI. Some groups such as Smiths
Industries in aerospace and John Brown in engineering pride themselves upon
being highly skilled buyers, integrators and appliers of technology to
specific markets rather than inventing it in house.
Perhaps most importantly the best British companies have developed a
management culture of continuous, incremental improvement to products and
processes which will continue through the recession.
Indeed one beneficial side-effect of this recession may be to expose the
relative fragility of the British approach to innovation. In the wake of the
1980-81 recession government policy and management effort was directed at
improving labour productivity, through trade union reform, de-manning and
the introduction of reformed working practices. The recession of 1990-91 may
well yield a different, and altogether more complicated, task - to shore up
and strengthen the British capacity to innovate.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Fears over warheads discounted -
Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that the nuclear warheads to be fitted to Britain's Trident missiles
could be unsafe were discounted by Mr Kenneth Carlisle, junior defence
procurement minister, in the Commons last night.
He gave an assurance that the warheads would be designed and manufactured in
the UK and would not be affected by the problems which led to the closure of
the plant at Rocky Flatts, near Denver, which produced missiles for the US
Trident force.
Concern over the warheads was raised by a US Congress armed services
committee report warning of the risk of 'unintended detonations'.
Mr Carlisle said the British made warheads would be subject to a series of
trials and independent assessments to ensure safety before and during
operational service.
He rejected opposition criticism of the Atomic Weapons Establishment Bill
which provides for private contractors to undertake the management of the
atomic weapons establishments at Aldermaston, Burghfield, Cardiff and
Foulness.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd to press Kuwaitis on human
rights - Foreign Office Questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, will raise concerns over human
rights abuses when he visits Kuwait at the beginning of next month. Mr Hurd
will be also be going to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan between May 1st and
5th.
In the Commons yesterday he said the government was taking seriously the
recent report by Amnesty International on the torture of Palestinians and
others in Kuwait.
'We take the Amnesty report seriously, because it's been made clear by us to
Kuwaiti ministers before the liberation, that we believe this should be a
new and hopeful chapter in the history of Kuwait,' said Mr Hurd.
While some retaliation and disorder was understandable, Mr Hurd said he
would reinforce the message he had given the government in exile.
During foreign office questions, MPs from both sides urged Mr Hurd to give
an assurance that foreign policy would remain the concern of individual
countries within the EC.
Mr Peter Shore (Lab Bethnal Green and Stepney) said divisions within the
European Community over the Gulf were 'very worrying indeed'.
He said the government should 'oppose the extension of majority voting to
any aspect of foreign policy'.
Mr David Wilshire, (Con Spelthorne) said it was possible to be a good
European by supporting economic aspects of the EC while questioning the
wisdom of a common foreign policy.
The advantage to Britain of joint action within the community should not be
under-rated, said Mr Hurd who pointed to the relief effort for the Kurds as
a good example of the twelve member countries working together effectively.
Later Mr Hurd defended the presence of British troops in Iraq after warnings
from a backbench MP about getting involved in the internal politics of Iraq.
'The purpose of the presence of our troops in northern Iraq is purely
humanitarian,' said Mr Hurd.
That did not prevent the government, when asked, from saying it believed the
Kurds should have autonomy within the boundaries of Iraq, he said.
Mr Douglas Hogg, the foreign office minister, insisted yesterday that full
diplomatic links with Iran would not be restored until the three British
hostages held in Lebanon were released.
'We believe Iran has a decisive influence over their future,' he said.

Corporate Affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, told the Commons yesterday the
Government was 'concerned' about threats made by certain national brewers to
serve their tenants with notices to quit.
He said the tenants involved were not yet protected by the Landlord and
Tenant Act 1990 extending to pub tenants the same protection as other
business tenants.
The Act requires brewers, for the first time, to pay statutory compensation
to tenants whose pubs are taken back into management, but does not become
fully effective until July 1992.
Mr Redwood said it was understood that most of the notices to quit had been
served for the purpose of renegotiating the terms of tenancy agreements and
would not ultimately lead to evictions.
The Government has begun appointing advisers for the flotation of part or
all of its remaining 48 per cent holding in British Telecom.
In the Commons yesterday Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the
Treasury, said no decisions had been taken about the timing and number of
shares to be sold.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Party set to discipline councillors
 -Lambeth Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR Party's national executive is intending to bring disciplinary
charges against thirteen suspended Lambeth councillors.
At a meeting yesterday the NEC committee reaffirmed its decision to suspend
members of the south London borough for 'continual breaches of the rules of
the party' and agreed to consider drawing up charges to go to the party's
national constitutional committee.
At this stage the councillors could face expulsion from the party.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said at the meeting: 'Who is going to be
convinced by people who say they are going to change the world and can't
even collect the garbage.'
The suspension of the councillors, which included Ms Joan Twelves, leader of
the council, followed council meetings which, in one case, voted against the
Labour leadership's policy by condemning Britain's role in the Gulf war and,
in the other, refused to allow bailiffs to be used to collect poll tax.
The meetings were deemed highly damaging to the national party.
Also suspended along with the councillors were Mr Steve Nally, secretary of
the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation, which Labour judges to be a
Militant front group, and Mr Kevin Fernandez, a prominent member.
With the campaign for next week's local elections well under way, the Labour
Party's national leadership is anxious to distance itself from hard-left
councils like Lambeth which is considered by some to be an electoral
liability.
The remaining 27 Labour councillors in Lambeth have been told to write to
the council's chief executive stating that they are members of the Labour
group.
The NEC has also instructed them to elect new officers at their next council
meeting on May 13th.
Until then Ms Twelves, one of those who has been suspended, is technically
still the leader of the council.

FT  25 APR 91 / The Guinness Appeals: Saunders said to be suffering dementia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ernest Saunders, the former chairman and chief executive of Guinness, is
suffering from incurable pre-senile dementia, the appeal court was told
yesterday. A scan has disclosed evidence of abnormalities of his brain.
Three doctors called to give evidence on Mr Saunders' appeal against the
five-year jail sentence he is serving for his part in the Guinness affair
said they had diagnosed pre-senile dementia and believed he would have been
suffering from it during his trial.
A doctor called by the Serious Fraud Office did not agree with that
'unequivocal diagnosis'. He said there was no definite correlation between
an abnormal brain scan and pre-senile dementia.
Mr Saunders, serving his sentence in Ford open prison in West Sussex, was
sentenced on August 28. He will become eligible for parole after a third of
his sentence, at the end of next April. Mr Saunders; Mr Anthony Parnes, a
City stockbroker; and Mr Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron group, are
appealing against their convictions and sentences.
Mr Antony Shaw, Mr Saunders' counsel, said the brain scan had been part of
an investigation carried out into possible organic causes for headaches from
which Mr Saunders had suffered for some time.
Mr John Chadwick, QC, for the SFO, said the Crown had been advised the
diagnosis was 'not impossible' but was not capable of being confirmed by
reference to the observations and tests so far carried out.
Dr Patrick Gallwey , a consultant with Devon and Cornwall Forensic
Psychiatric Services, said he had treated Mr Saunders in 1988. When he had
seen him earlier this month the change in Mr Saunders' symptoms, coupled
with the scan evidence, had been sufficient to diagnose pre-senile dementia
of the Alzheimer type.
Dr George Perkin, consultant neurologist at Charing Cross Hospital, called
by the SFO, said the 'bedside tests' carried out on Saunders would raise 'a
suspicion' of pre-senile dementia, but he would want further, and much more
structured, data. He said that undoubtedly if Mr Saunders did have
pre-senile dementia it would be a progressive disorder and it should be
easier month by month to make a diagnosis based on psychometric tests,
because changes would become much more evident.
The appeals continue today.

FT  25 APR 91 / IBM to shed 400 jobs at two sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer maker, is
rationalising its manufacturing activities in the UK with the loss of 400
jobs over three years at its plants in the south of England and in Scotland.
IBM manufactures magnetic disc files, the memory systems used in large
mainframe computers, at Havant in Hampshire, and personal computers at its
Greenock plant near Glasgow. The company said it remained committed to a
policy of full employment and there would be no redundancies.
The rationalisation measures are designed to eliminate duplication in
services to the two plants.
They will involve creating a single structure for planning, finance,
information processing and site services under Mr John Holmes, director of
manufacturing for IBM UK.
IBM plants worldwide compete against each other to manufacture particular
computer systems. The performance of plants making comparable equipment in
the US, Europe and Asia is closely monitored.
The company said yesterday that the chief aim of the rationalisation was to
improve the cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of the UK manufacturing
operations with the intention of winning more manufacturing 'missions' for
the UK plants. That did not imply that Havant and Greenock were less
efficient than their counterparts in the US or Japan.
Over the past three years, IBM has moved thousands of employees worldwide
from administrative positions into line jobs.
Many other workers have been encouraged to leave through voluntary
redundancy schemes as part of a restructuring operation designed to match
overheads to a market that has slowed from growth rates of more than 20 per
cent to 10 per cent or less.

FT  25 APR 91 / Public entry to police cases urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS allegations against police officers should be heard at tribunals
open to the public, Judge Francis Petre, chairman of the police complaints
authority, said yesterday.
The authority, an independent government-appointed body, oversees
investigations into serious complaints against the police. Its annual report
published yesterday shows that it is supervising 60 per cent more cases now
than in 1987.
Judge Petre, introducing the report, said that the proposed tribunals
hearing serious cases would include independent representatives and
recommend punishments to chief constables. Less serious allegations would
still be handed by police forces internally, but with lower standards of
proof than at present.
The authority believes that the standard of proof in complaints against
police officers is unnecessarily high.
He also criticised the level of secrecy surrounding the handling of
complaints. At present, those making complaints are not informed of
disciplinary decisions made by chief constables.
Last year the authority received 7,156 new cases for consideration - 16 per
cent more than in 1989.
The authority's report expresses concern at the length of time taken to
complete investigations into complaints.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETY receipts fell to Pounds 543m in March from Pounds 608m in
February, mainly because investors withdrew funds to apply for electricity
shares.
However, mortgage advances rose sharply to Pounds 3.356bn from Pounds
2.681bn in February as falling interest rates spurred homebuying. Mr Mark
Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, predicted
that lending would continue to pick up in the coming months.

FT  25 APR 91 / Engineering slide expected to last into 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S engineering industry is unlikely to see any real recovery from the
recession until at least mid 1992 and has not yet reached the bottom of the
current downturn, according to a gloomy forecast by the Engineering
Employers' Federation.
Output, productivity, employment and exports are all still dropping, the EEF
said yesterday in its spring 1991 trends report. Employment is forecast to
fall a further 90,000 by this time next year to 1.9m, making a total
reduction of 210,000 over three years.
Mr Peter Brighton, director general, said the EEF's forecasts 'obviously
differed' from those of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who this week
forecast a slow recovery in output in the second half of this year.
Mr Brighton said he disagreed with the view of some in industry that the
upturn is already happening. 'The rate of decline is decreasing, but we
haven't reached the bottom' in manufacturing industry, he said.
He ger-term effects of a further decline in British manufacturing. 'The
simple thing is that our manufacturing base is now down at a level where it
will not be able to cope with the upturn,' he said.
That was the main reason why the EEF was relatively pessimistic about the
mid-term outlook for engineering exports. In the more immediate future, it
sees the decline in engineering exports, which began in the second half of
last year, continuing this year, before recovering slowly in the first half
of 1992.
The one relatively bright spot was in motor vehicle exports, which rose
sharply at the end of last year and are expected to stay high. In contrast,
domestic demand for vehicles is very weak.
The EEF has 5,000 member companies in electronics, computers, electrical and
mechanical engineering, motor vehicles, aerospace and shipbuilding. It said
the recession was affecting virtually the entire industry.
Engineering output is estimated to have fallen about 8 per cent between the
first halves of 1990 and 1991 and a further decline of 2 per cent is
forecast between the first six months of 1991 and 1992.
Sales by the engineering sector this year are forecast at about Pounds 128bn
 -of which Pounds 50bn are for export - compared with Pounds 136bn in 1990,
and Pounds 117bn 10 years earlier . All figures are at 1991 prices.
The EEF said productivity - output volume per person - had dropped in spite
of falling employment, but further job cuts this year and next would prevent
productivity from falling below early-1991 levels.

FT  25 APR 91 / Toll of cuts in media staff mounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOLL of media job losses is mounting. The BBC yesterday announced 364
redundancies among its national radio staff while News International is to
cut 185 jobs from its newspaper printing workforce.
The BBC redundancies will affect cleaning, catering and security staff at
Broadcasting House in London, where its national radio operation is located.
The losses, which involve one in eight employees at Broadcasting House, are
the result of the BBC's decision to contract out those services.
Yesterday's announcement means the BBC has called for more than 1,000
redundancies this week, after Tuesday's 720 job losses at its network
television operation in west London.
The BBC is cutting costs across all activities as part of the Funding the
Future financial restructuring programme intended to save Pounds 75m a year
by 1993. Yesterday's cuts will reduce Broadcasting House overheads by at
least Pounds 1m a year.
Those redundancies bring the total of jobs lost as a result of Funding the
Future to 2,818.
The job cuts at Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International are among the
printing workers who produce its national newspapers, including The Sun and
The Times.
Most of the job losses will be at Wapping, its main newspaper production
plant in east London. The company also plans to shed 56 staff at its
regional printing plants in Glasgow and near Liverpool.
The redundancies follow News International's decision to restructure
printing operations by changing shift patterns. They also form part of
general cost-cutting after the completion of Mr Murdoch's Dollars 7.4bn
(Pounds 4.4bn) debt restructuring measures. Century Newspapers of Belfast,
publishers of the News Letter, the UK's oldest morning newspaper, is to cut
45 jobs at the end of the month, nearly a fifth of its workforce.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE streamlined city lifestyle of thousands of New Yorkers has been thrown
into turmoil this week. From the most high-toned Park Avenue apartment
blocks to hovels in Hell's Kitchen, residents are confronting a strike by
30,000 building service workers.
This is no joking matter. Jobs done by striking employees - members of Local
32B-32J of the Service Employees International - range from internal rubbish
collection to building maintenance. Many doormen, security guards, lift
operators and caretakers have joined the strike.
At issue is a new wage contract. Neither side has been forthcoming about the
negotiations, but at the weekend, when the strike began, the union claimed
that the building owners, represented by the Realty Advisory Board on Labour
Relations, were offering wage increases of only 2 per cent a year over three
years.
Even so, the strike seemed to take some union members by surprise. 'The
first I knew about it was when we were called out on Sunday,' said one
doorman.
To date, the dispute seems to have been largely good-humoured. Good doormen
are a valuable commodity in New York, and those residents inclined to whinge
are careful to do so out of the strikers' earshot. Many apartment blocks,
meanwhile, quickly instigated temporary arrangements, asking residents to
take out their own rubbish.
Even in extreme situations, it seems commonsense prevails: two striking
Fifth Avenue doormen were reported to have abandoned their picket-line
yesterday to rescue a maid who had set fire to her wealthy employer's
apartment with an overheated iron.
How the dispute will be resolved is unclear. The union claims that many
building owners are settling individually, saying that these numbers now run
into three figures.
The owners claim that this trend is being over-played and that the number of
individual settlements is much less. In the meantime, New Yorkers can only
grit their teeth and put out the rubbish.

NICARAGUA expects to settle Dollars 360m in overdue payments to the World

year, following the approval of Dollars 225m in bridging loan finance by the
Mexican, Venezuelan and Spanish governments.
Mr Antonio Lacayo, Nicaragua's Minister for the Presidency, said on Tuesday
night that Mexico and Spain had confirmed in the past week their support for
the financial package. He said that Venezuelan support was to be ratified
during the state visit of President Carlos Andres Perez to Nicaragua today,
to mark celebrations of the first year in office of President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua.
Between Dollars 100m and Dollars 150m has been pledged by other countries on
longer-term finance. A special meeting is to be held in mid-May in Paris to
finalise the entire package.
Settlement of the overdue payments to the multilateral institutions is
considered to be a central pillar of the government's economic stabilisation
plan, as it would unlock new foreign credit for the country.

FT  25 APR 91 / Kurdish leaders meet Saddam: Meeting angers other opposition
groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Saddam Hussein of Iraq held talks yesterday with Kurdish guerrilla
leaders who want internationally-guaranteed autonomy from Baghdad and the
safe return of Kurdish refugees to their homes.
Iraqi government officials have been negotiating with the Kurds since last
Friday, but the state-run Iraqi media mentioned the discussions for the
first time yesterday.
Kurdish organisations have expressed optimism that President Saddam will
make concessions to the Kurds, although many Kurds hate and distrust him and
some non-Kurdish opposition groups are angry about the negotiations.
President Saddam met Mr Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, and representatives of other Kurdish parties, the Iraqi news
agency said.
'The meeting means there was agreement on the basic points and that a
breakthrough was achieved in the talks,' a Kurdish official in Damascus was
quoted as saying.
Both sides need a deal. President Saddam's army is weakened by the Gulf war
and he could not use chemical weapons against the Kurds without incurring
the wrath of the international community.
The Kurdish guerrillas are still a force to be reckoned with in the
mountains, but they are fighting for an empty political cause if nearly 2m
Kurdish refugees - half the Kurds of Iraq - do not return home from the
borders of Iran and Turkey.
It remains to be seen if Mr Saddam will accept Kurdish demands for a
genuinely autonomous region within a democratic Iraq, for control over oil
revenue from Kurdish areas, and for international guarantees to bolster any
agreement.
A loose ceasefire is in force in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, but
Shia Moslem rebels in the south continue to announce guerrilla attacks on
government targets.
The Voice of the Iraqi Opposition radio station recently described Mr
Talabani's discussions with the government as 'a stab in the back for all
the Iraqis'.

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO has agreed that a 20 per cent target figure can be included in a new
pact with the US on its foreign semiconductor market share in Japan, but the
two countries were divided last night over final wording of the agreement.
Japanese officials suggested they had made a significant concession in
accepting the figure, although it has been clear that the US would not
conclude the negotiations unless a target was set.
The two countries have argued for five years over whether a target figure
was set for the first semiconductor agreement, which began in 1986 and will
expire at the end of July, with Washington insisting that the commitment was
contained in a side-letter and Tokyo arguing that no such commitment was
made.
Japanese officials want the 20 per cent to be seen as a general goal rather
than a specific target, and are aiming for a final wording of the agreement
to be vague enough for it not to be a precedent for market share targets in
other trade areas.
The foreign-market share in Japan at the end of last year was 13.2 per cent
and, under the US interpretation of the present agreement, was supposed to
be 20 per cent in July, a target that is now out of reach.
The latest round of negotiations for a new pact began here on Tuesday and
continued late last night. While there were hopes that the agreement would
be settled, officials of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and the
office of the US Trade Representative are likely to have to meet again.
Other important issues have been Japan's insistence that sanctions imposed
under the present agreement be lifted, and the choice of a measurement
standard for the market share. Japanese officials have argued that Japanese
companies are making efforts to increase their use of foreign chips and
these efforts should be recognised in the new agreement.

FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: Caricom slow to put common into market -
Agreed uniform external tariffs look like being held up a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EFFORTS of the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) to create a
customs union are being set back by reservations by some member governments
over the impact of a new common external tariff.
The new tariff should have been implemented by all 13 members at the start
of this year. In the event, several were unable to meet the deadline, with
trade ministers saying they were concerned about the impact on national
economies.
Government officials and representatives of the Community's secretariat
appear confident that the common tariff will be in place by the end of this
year. They suggested that, despite the delay, the implementation of the
common tariff would be significant for the Community, not least because it
was written into the treaty establishing Caricom 18 years ago.
While the Community is moving with equal uncertainty towards the reduction
of barriers to trade among its members - the aim is to have a common market
in place by 1993 and monetary union the following year - the level of
success with which the common external tariff is implemented could determine
the viability of any attempt to increase economic integration.
Efforts at integration have been bedevilled by parochial concerns and the
tendency of some governments to implement significant changes in economic
policy without consulting partners.
'We have to get our act together in view of what is happening in Europe and
other parts of the world,' said Mr John Compton, prime minister of St Lucia.
'All of these things show we must have a common market, and we must have the
common external tariff.'
The community is made up of the English-speaking countries in the region,
including Belize in central America and Guyana in South America. It has a
combined market of 5.5m people. All members, except the Bahamas which is not
a signatory of the trading agreements, have said they will implement the
common tariff.
The proposed tariff structure promises low rates of duty on imports which do
not compete with goods produced within the community, but sets high rates on
any imports likely to injure domestic industry. Under the new tariff the
highest rate of duty will be 45 per cent and the lowest 5 per cent. This
replaces a structure where tariffs range from 5 per cent to 70 per cent.
The new measures will streamline the three different tariff structures used
in the community. Rates will differ where imports are raw materials or
finished products, and agricultural products will be given protection while
inputs for agriculture will be subject to low tariffs.
'There is need for the common external tariff to stimulate production in the
community,' said Mr Hayden Blades, director of trade and agriculture for the
Community secretariat.
'But the tariff structure must not encourage inefficient production. The
tariffs have to be set at levels which will allow regional industry to be
competitive,' he said.
In effect, however, most of the smaller Community members, in particular the
smaller islands of the eastern Caribbean, and Belize on mainland central
America, will have to raise their import duties, while the more developed
countries (Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Guyana) will be
lowering theirs.
This has led some government officials in the smaller states to be concerned
about the inflationary impact of the common tariff.
Mr Charles Maynard, trade minister of Dominica, says the the new
arrangements will have to be constantly monitored to determine the impact on
the cost of living 'so we can decide, at the level of the Community's
Ministerial Council whether we need to revise it upwards of downwards'.
Several governments have become dependent on revenues from import duties,
and have moved to cushion the expected loss of income with the lowering of
tariffs. The Jamaican government has imposed a sales tax on some imports on
which duties have been reduced.
The new tariff offers greater protection to the fledgling industries of the
smaller community members, while presenting increased competition to
businesses in the larger countries. The community's industrial sector is
based on light manufacturing and the assembly and re-export of consumer
durables.
The changes caused by the new arrangements have unsettled some
manufacturers. Mr Anthony Robinson, president of the Jamaica Manufacturers
Association, has complained that the implementation of the common external
tariff has exacerbated differences in the level of competitiveness among the
Caribbean Community members.
Mr Robinson said Jamaican manufacturers may be forced to close or reduce
operations because '. . . our Community competitors pay no duty on raw
materials, and having made the products, ship them here at between 14 per
cent and 21 per cent less than it costs Jamaican manufacturers to ship
products to other parts of the Community.'
Mr Compton argued that the Caribbean Community has no option but to
implement measures such as the common external tariff. 'It will take some
sacrifice, there might be short-term adjustments and we must be prepared to
bear these sacrifices if the Caribbean is to adjust itself economically to
meet the challenges of the outside world.'

<TEXT>
SUZUKI is to become the first Japanese car maker to assemble cars in eastern
Europe. It is to take a 40 per cent stake in a joint venture in Hungary,
Magyar Suzuki, to produce up to 60,000 cars a year.
Its partners in the venture are C Itoh, the Japanese trading group, with an
11 per cent stake, Autokonszern, a Hungarian consortium (40 per cent), and
International Finance Corporation, a World Bank affiliate (9 per cent).
The total project cost of more than Y32bn (Pounds 136m) makes it Hungary's
largest joint venture undertaking to date. Magyar Suzuki will have an equity
capital of Y10bn. Production is due to start at end-1992, Mr Osamu Suzuki,
Suzuki Motor president, said. Viability depended on promoting local
production of components and improving quality, he added.
The company said output would be about 15,000 in the first year, rising to
50,000 after the third. The workforce will total some 1,100 when production
reaches 50,000 a year. Suzuki aims to reach a target of 60,000 cars a year
by 1997.
The venture will be located at Esztergom, north of Budapest. Suzuki said it
would assemble its small 1- and 1.3-litre Suzuki Swift hatch-back range at
the plant.
The Japanese car maker is giving local parts suppliers a stake in the
success of the project by taking them on as equity-holding partners. It is
encouraging them to link up with its own suppliers in Japan through joint
venture or licensing agreements.
Up to 1997, it aims to increase local content to some 70 per cent. Suzuki
seeks to sell about 60 per cent of output in the Hungarian market, with some
40 per cent exported mainly to western Europe.
Like Fiat's small-car production at FSM in Poland, Suzuki will seek to
export from its Hungarian plant to the whole of the European market.
Hungary was chosen because it had the most market-oriented economy in
eastern Europe and a home market free of domestic competitors, Mr Istvan
Lepsenyi, Magyar Suzuki president, said. The Suzuki investment in Hungary
follows moves by General Motors and Ford of the US to set up manufacturing
operations in Hungary.
General Motors has formed a joint venture with Raba, the Hungarian
state-owned maker of trucks, diesel engines, and tractors, to build Opel car
engines and to assemble Opel cars with an investment of around Dollars 150m
(Pounds 88m). It has a 67 per cent stake and management control.
It aims to produce up to 30,000 Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra cars and 200,000
engines a year at a plant at Szentgotthard, close to the Austrian border.
Ford plans an investment of Dollars 80m in a wholly-owned plant in
Szekesfehervar producing ignitions.
Plans by western car makers are now advanced for moving into eastern Europe,
with Volkswagen investing heavily in Czechoslovakia and eastern Germany, and
General Motors establishing operations in eastern Germany and Hungary.
Fiat is still the dominant force in Poland but GM is also expected to begin
negotiations shortly for an assembly venture in Warsaw with FSO. Fiat has
led western car makers' moves in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.
Hungary has granted favourable tax and customs duty treatment for the the
Suzuki project.
Yesterday's signing marked the belated end of a six-year gestation for the
venture. Suzuki's insistence on a 10-year tax holiday had postponed
agreement. Analysts also said the delay and the scaling down of the Japanese
car maker's earlier ambitions had followed a change of strategy.
Previously, the company had intended to use Hungary as a base for deliveries
to the rest of the region. After the disintegration of the Comecon system of
trade between east European countries, Hungary has no preferential access,
however.

FT  25 APR 91 / Brussels crackdown on Italian state aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has told Italy to explain why it has prolonged an
Ecu292m (Pounds 200m) aid scheme for the consumer electronics industry,
approved by Brussels in 1984-85 for only five years. The move is part of a
widening crackdown by the EC on illegal state aid.
The action is intended as much to forestall further aid it believes Rome is
planning, as to hold Italy to the agreement.
This put strict time limits on the aid, channelled through the state's
Ristrutturazione Elettronica SpA (REL), set up by the Italian industry
ministry in 1982 to restructure the sector by taking minority stakes in, and
providing soft loans for, consumer electronics manufacturers and components
suppliers.
The stakes were supposed to be sold to the private sector after five years;
the Commission says state holdings in six companies have not been.
Furthermore, Brussels says, three companies in receipt of the subsidised
loans have missed their repayments schedule.
This 'illegal application' of the agreed aid regime constitutes a distortion
of competition, the Commission says, and it has asked Rome for a reply
within one month.
Yesterday's decision follows the announcement of four state aid inquiries
this month. These are into French plans to pump more than Dollars 1bn into
Bull, the computer maker, and Thomson, the defence and electronics group;
into France's use of its main state enterprises to funnel money into smaller
companies in industrially declining areas; into a Dollars 230m Italian plan
to restructure the road haulage sector; and into Belgium's plans to
recapitalise Sabena, its ailing flag airline, to the tune of Dollars 1bn.
The Commission also intends to investigate France's plans to inject around
Dollars 400m into Air France.
By contrast, the Commission yesterday approved eight separate state aid
schemes allowed by EC law: for research and development and for backward
regions in Italy and Spain; for small to medium-sized industry in Italy and
for Dutch shipbuilders; and a UK undertaking on future industrial aid to
assisted areas.

<TEXT>
THE German government is bracing itself for a dramatic increase in east
German unemployment in July, when several hundred thousand public servants
will lose their jobs and the one year ban on redundancies in the engineering
industry ends.
Mr Thomas Geitz, an official at the BDA, one of the main employers'
organisations, said that the engineering industry agreement had been
reluctantly respected but employers were hoping to shed many workers in
July. IG Metall, the industry union, is seeking talks to extend the
agreement.
Many engineering workers in east Germany are on government supported
short-time working so the effect of ending the no-redundancies agreement
will be to transfer many short-time workers (currently about 2m) to the
unemployed total (now about 1m).
Most of the several hundred thousand public servants who have been suspended
on 70 per cent of their pay since the end of last year will also lose their
jobs in July. The public servants worked for organs of the former communist
state which have now been dissolved.
Yesterday the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe ruled that the
suspension of the workers had not been unconstitutional, except in the case
of pregnant women whose suspension contravened their job security
arrangements.
Early signs of upswing in the east German economy were detected yesterday by
two economic research institutes, the IFO in Munich and the DIW in west
Berlin. The IFO business confidence report said that in February the
business climate had improved for the first time since August last year.
DIW said incomes in east Germany rose by a fifth from the middle of 1989 to
the end of 1990, reaching about 60 per cent of the west German level.

FRANCE'S foreign trade deficit widened slightly in March, according to
provisional figures published yesterday, writes Ian Davidson in Paris.
The slowdown in demand in France and abroad led to unchanged levels of
exports, while imports increased very slightly. The underlying trend points
to a further gentle deterioration ahead.
The seasonally adjusted deficit in March grew to FFr4.7bn (Pounds 460m),
compared with FFr3.5bn in February and FFr5.7bn in January. The deficit in
industrial goods grew to FFr4.5bn, compared with FFr1.9bn in February.

THE World Bank has approved a Dollars 120m loan aimed at improving Poland's
inefficient telecommunications system. The loan will help finance the
installation of a new digital system including new switches, fibre optic
cables and the construction of a satellite ground station to improve
international links.
The World Bank is also considering a Dollars 300m loan to aid privatisation
and industrial restructuring, as well as another Dollars 300m loan for heat
supply and conservation projects.
A further Dollars 500m of loans devoted to developing financial
institutions, employment promotion, agriculture and health services are also
being considered.
The telecommunications project is primarily aimed at providing an
improvement for 70,000 new business subscribers and will be part of Poland's
telephone modernisation programme which is set to cost Dollars 1.5bn over
the next ten years.
Next week PPTT,the country's telecommunications authority, is to announce a
shortlist of western companies which are bidding to supply a separate
cellular telephone network costing Dollars 150m, which should provide
100,000 lines over five years.
The World Bank loan, to be repaid over 17 years, is to be accompanied by an
Ecu70m (Pounds 48m) loan from the European Investment Bank. The project
includes the installation of 12 digital switches and should improve
communications between 17 towns as well as calls abroad.
Poland's Finance Ministry has decided to suspend sales of bonds which gave
holders a 20 per cent discount when used to buy shares in privatised
companies. The issue was to have run till 1994.
The decision, which will be implemented early next month, comes after a
parliamentary declaration in February criticised the scheme for overly
favouring investors.
The bonds, with an interest rate index-linked to the monthly inflation rate,
have been on sale since December 1989. Zl 196.7bn of the bonds had been sold
by the end of February.

THE EC Council of Ministers yesterday settled a institutional row with other
Community bodies and approved Ecu3.83bn (Pounds 2.62bn) for ten research
projects over the next two and a half years.
The row, which threatened further to delay the EC's already tardy framework
programme for 1990-94, was a by-product of the sparring between EC
institutions in the negotiations on political union.
The Council had earlier changed five programmes - on marine and life
sciences, the environment, communications and electronic data transmission -
to the extent that the parliament persuaded the Commission to withdraw them
altogether. Pulling these programmes off the table and then resubmitting
would have delayed them months.
So,in the end, the EC executive and parliament settled for a few vague and
minor changes, such as promises to weigh the socio-economic impact of EC
research, which were adopted by EC ministers yesterday and are expected to
win parliamentary approval next month.
In addition to these five programmes, ministers also reached basic political
agreement on information technology (worth Ecu1.33bn alone), medical
research, industrial materials, and non-nuclear energy and the
agro-industrial programme.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (15): 'Birds can mean good business' -
Environmental Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST TOURISTS take one look at the Gouves estuary with its shallow, brackish
lagoons and tufts of spiky grass and head further down the beach.
But birdwatchers are fascinated: this 30-acre wetland near Heraklion on the
northern coast of Crete is a stop-over for dozens of exotic species
migrating to and from the rest of Europe.
With a little luck, Gouves should become the first organised centre for
environmental tourism in Greece. Next to it is a 680-bed hotel belonging to
Grechotel, the country's largest hotel management group, which is backing
the project.
The problem until recently was opposition from local residents, who wanted
to fill in the river delta and take advantage of soaring prices for property
close to the sea.
In fact, one part of the delta is now covered by a soccer pitch. But the
remaining lagoons are still frequented by such rarities as the giant
flamingo, the glossy ibis, the pallid harrier and the booted eagle. More
than 170 species have been logged on spring visits by British birdwatching
groups.
Mr Nikos Daskalantonakis, Grechotel's chairman, who owns a sizeable part of
the delta, is ready to see his property included in a nature reserve planned
for Gouves. 'Green tourism could be very successful on Crete,' he says. 'Why
shouldn't Gouves set the trend?'
Many Greek wetlands have disappeared in the past 20 years as long stretches
of sandy coastline were swallowed up by hotels and bungalow complexes.
Though specialised bird and flower tours to Crete have been operating for
years, environmental awareness was slow to develop in the rush to exploit
traditional sea and sun tourism.
But members of the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature have been
taking an interest in Gouves for several years. Now the Greek tourism
ministry is also involved.
A scheme to develop Gouves along the lines of the highly successful Minsmere
nature reserve in Suffolk is being considered for European Community
funding, as one of four green tourism projects in Crete. If accepted, the
Community would contribute 50 per cent of the costs initially estimated at
about Dr48m (Dollars 250,000).
In the meantime, the bird enthusiasts have been trying to persuade people in
Gouves that their lagoons will be worth more in the long run if they are not
filled in and sold off as building plots.
Mrs Anne Cryer, who runs a travel business for the Wildlife Trust in
Britain, argued the case with the villagers with the help of videotapes from
Minsmere dubbed into Greek.
'I think there's now a growing realisation that Gouves actually has a
natural resource that will help it catch up with other tourist areas. Birds
can mean very good business,' she says.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (14): Foreign visitors set to fall at least
10% - How the country's tourist bodies and hoteliers are trying to win back
lost trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZEUS XENIOS, the ancient Greek god in charge of offering hospitality to
strangers, seems to have turned his back on the tourist industry. For the
third time in six years, a disastrous plunge in bookings threatens to wreck
a promising year for earnings.
Once again, a US travel warning to its nationals to avoid the eastern
Mediterranean because of the risk of terrorist attacks following the Gulf
war is scaring off the high-spending sector of the Greek market: Japanese
honeymooners, incentive groups and conference organisers as well as the
older Americans who like cruising in the Aegean.
Similar advice in 1985 was blamed for two unfavourable seasons that
followed. Then came a terrorist attack aboard a cruise ship in 1988. This
year a series of bomb explosions damaged foreign bank branches and tourist
buses and a badly aimed rocket narrowly missed a luxury hotel. There were no
injuries but concerns over visitors' safety have revived.
As in the past, the Greek Tourist Organisation (EOT) is trying to win back
lost trade through heavier advertising. This year's campaign will cost Dr6bn
(Dollars 33m). It is being co-ordinated for the first time by a group of
Athens advertising agencies with international affiliations. This, it is
hoped, will prove more effective than relying on haphazard media-buying by
EOT offices abroad.
Senior Greek tourism officials have visited the big tour operators in
Britain and Germany, their two main markets, as well as the US, offering
reassurances about airport security and the government's determination to
crack down on terrorism.
'We constantly point out that Athens is still one of the safest cities in
Europe for visitors, in spite of what has been going on,' says Mr Nikos
Iatrakos, EOT's secretary-general. 'However, we still face a considerable
drop in numbers this year, 10 per cent at minimum but perhaps as much as 20
per cent.'
In 1990, tourist arrivals reached a record 9.3m, a 9 per cent increase over
the previous year's 8.5m, the average figure for most of the past decade.
Official foreign exchange inflows totalled Dollars 2.57bn, up from Dollars
1.89bn in 1989.
But if credit card purchases, cruise earnings and tour operators'
commissions paid abroad are counted in, overall tourist earnings rose to
Dollars 4.1bn, almost 6 per cent of GDP. Income for 1991 was expected to be
well over Dollars 5bn but 'now we'll be lucky to maintain last year's
levels,' says Mr Iatrakos.
The worst-affected region this year will undoubtedly be Athens. Despite its
chronic traffic and pollution problems it remains the focus for most
conferences and incentive tours and a starting point for the classical tours
favoured by the Americans and Japanese.
Hopes of substantially boosting tourism in the capital during the 1990s
suffered a setback last autumn with the failure of Athens' bid to stage the
1996 Olympic Games.
Advance bookings for the Mediterranean Games in July, one of several major
sports events planned as dress rehearsals for an Athens Olympics, are
disappointing, according to the organisers.
But amid the general gloom, tourist officials note one optimistic pointer
for the future: the sale of the 100-year-old Grande Bretagne Hotel, to a
Dutch-based investment company which has transferred management to Ciga, the
international hotel group. As a family-run establishment, Athens' best-known
luxury hotel could barely make ends meet, with occupancy averaging only 55
per cent in recent years.
Ciga is expected to invest considerably in refurbishing to bring the Grande
Bretagne's facilities up to the standard of its other traditional luxury
hotels around Europe. 'The presence of a really top-quality hotel in Athens
will upgrade the surrounding area and encourage other hotels to try harder,'
says Mr Iatrakos.
The government is already trying to ensure that older first-class hotels
around Greece, including some in spectacular settings, are upgraded to the
standards of increasingly demanding guests. It is breaking up a
state-controlled hotel chain and offering individual units to private
operators on long-term leases.
Improving hotel facilities is one of the easier ways of attracting more
older, wealthier tourists, something Greece has been trying to do for years
but without conspicuous success.
With 433,000 hotel beds, Greece has no shortage of accommodation. But many
large island resort hotels built in the boom years of the 1970s have not
been maintained to international tour operators' standards. Occupancy levels
in Corfu and Rhodes have slipped in recent years.
It is no coincidence that the one area where bookings picked up sharply once
the Gulf war ended was Crete, which boasts some of the best-run hotels in
Greece. Last year the island drew over 1.7m tourists, close to 25 per cent
of total arrivals.
'Large-scale tourism didn't start in Crete till the early 1980s. The resort
hotels are newer and better managed and many of the mistakes made elsewhere
were avoided. As a result, we get a very high proportion of return
visitors,' says Mr Thanos Habipis, chairman of the Cretan Hoteliers'
Federation.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (16): Manos tackles the car fumes - Athens
Pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Stefanos Manos is fed up with discussing the problems of Athens. The
minister of environment and public works, an energetic - some would say
impatient - technocrat, he blames 'endless talking and delays in
decision-making' for the continuing presence of the nefos, the brown
pollution cloud that hangs over the city in still weather.
Car exhaust fumes are the major source of atmospheric pollution in Athens,
now that industrial emissions are more strictly controlled and householders
banned from using heavy diesel oil for heating.
Last summer Mr Manos proposed a tax break for Athenians who bought a new car
equipped with a catalytic converter, provided that their old model was
turned in.
Less than six months later, a short space of time by the standards of Greek
bureaucracy, the measure was fully in operation. Car buyers, who normally
pay import tariffs of over 100 per cent on new vehicles, rushed to the
showrooms. Within weeks, the main graveyard for superannuated cars near
Mount Parnes outside the city was almost overflowing.
Over the past decade the number of private cars in Athens has risen from
550,000 to 880,000. This was partly the result of government attempts to cut
pollution levels in the city centre by permitting cars to circulate only on
alternate days, according to the final digit of their number-plate.
Athenians got around the odd-even driving ban by acquiring a second car. But
since many new purchases were of second-hand vehicles, the city's car fleet
grew visibly older and dirtier. At the beginning of 1990, 40 per cent of
private cars were more than 10 years old, compared with 15-20 per cent in
other European Community capitals.
'The incentives are very successful. At the present rate, 30 per cent of the
Athens car fleet will be replaced in three years. Then from 1993, only clean
cars will be allowed into the city centre,' Mr Manos says.
The next stage of his plan to banish the nefos is to build a network of
underground garages across the city to provide 25,000 new parking spaces by
1994. They would be privately operated for 25 years and then turned over to
the Athens municipality.
'On any weekday, there are 45,000 cars illegally parked around Athens and 60
per cent of the city's road surfaces are taken up by stationary vehicles. If
we get parked cars off the streets, traffic will start flowing faster and
there'll be fewer fumes,' Mr Manos says.
The third stage is to revive a highway project first proposed over 40 years
ago by building about 50 kilometres of highway across northern Athens to
relieve pressures on central traffic arteries. It will cost about Dr150bn
(Dollars 850m) and be operated 'by the constructor as a toll road, a fast
highway where you pay to save time.'
Mr Manos says he is sticking to 'quite simple projects, because you have so
little time to make anything happen before people start thinking in terms of
the next election.'
The biggest project of all, a Dr250bn extension of the Athens underground,
should finally get under way by the end of the year. Its start is already
two years behind schedule because of politically inspired delays and a
dispute over contract terms.
An international consortium led by Siemens of Germany is to build two new
lines across the city centre, totalling 18 kilometres in length, and nine
stations including one beneath Constitution Square. The extension will take
six years to complete and should carry 1bn passengers a year.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (11): Athens roof for the arts - Classical
Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLASSICAL MUSIC lovers, long a beleaguered minority in a country whose
best-known composers are associated with the bouzouki, now have a concert
hall to be proud of. The Megaro Mousikis, a white marble cube overlooking a
main Athens avenue, has taken almost 40 years to complete, and its
German-designed acoustics are said to compete with any symphony hall in
northern Europe.
All the same, last month's opening was a modest affair. Almost nothing was
done to mark the occasion. The Moscow Soloists, a chamber-sized ensemble led
by Yuri Bashmet, a viola player, launched into Bach's Brandenburg Concerto
No. 6 without a trace of inauguration night nerves.
It was the audience who looked awed, as much by the surroundings as the
music. Until now, concert-going in Greece has required stoic dedication. It
usually means perching in the precipitous tiers of an ancient theatre on a
hot summer night with someone's knees pressing into the small of your back.
Moonlight and history do not necessarily compensate for the thin quality of
sound wafted from far below.
'Modern Athens never had a roof for the arts. This is what the Megaro will
provide,' says Mr Christos Lambrakis, the owner of Greece's largest
newspaper group. As chairman of the Friends of Music, which persuaded the
state to provide a site for the Megaro but repeatedly ran out of funds for
construction, he convinced the former socialist government to come up with
most of the Dr19bn (Dollars 10.5m) needed to complete the project.
Music is one of the areas where Greek cultural tradition has kept its
distance from the west. Folk music followed eastern rhythms; in cities the
equally oriental sound of the bouzouki held sway.
The bouzouki used to be inextricably linked with rebetika, harsh songs about
drugs and violence in the Greek underworld. It was made respectable by
composers Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hadjidakis, whose scores for the films
'Zorba the Greek' and 'Never on Sunday' brought a softened version of
rebetika to a much bigger audience.
Yet Greece occasionally produced classical musicians of the stature of Maria
Callas or Dimitri Mitropoulos, the conductor, who became household names
like the bouzouki singers. In recent years classical music has gained ground
rapidly, helped by the success of a new generation of performers with an
international reputation.
But would the potential Greek audience be large enough to support a concert
hall seating 2,000? Mr Lambrakis suspected not, so the Megaro was redesigned
as a multi-purpose building when work on its concrete skeleton resumed in
1986 after a seven-year gap.
'Greece is obviously not the kind of country that can provide large
subsidies for the arts. We have to try to ensure that we can pay our way,'
he says.
The original design by a German architect, Heinrich Keilholz, was radically
overhauled to provide additional facilities for staging opera and theatre
and to accommodate advances in acoustic technology. The acoustics were
designed by Prof Helmut Muller, whose research was used in construction of
the Opera de la Bastille in Paris.
'It would have been too expensive to demolish the concrete shell, so we had
to work within the constraints of the original frame of a building which had
a much less ambitious purpose. This presented a great challenge to the civil
engineers,' says Mr Rolf Krogmeyer, an architect who worked on the Megaro at
the start of his career and found himself unexpectedly recalled years later.
The result is a hexagonal shaped hall with tiered boxes rising from both
sides of the stage. Behind the stage is a huge organ, concealed by a wooden
screen. The organ is a gift from Siemens and the Greek and German
governments.
The suspended ceiling, panelled in American red oak, can be set in four
separate positions to accommodate the variations in sound reflection that
are needed for the full enjoyment of different kinds of performance: opera,
theatre, chamber and symphony music.
'Nowadays, acoustics dictate the shape of a concert hall. To achieve clarity
of speech you must be able to shrink the space but for the sound of a
symphony orchestra to be appreciated, it must be enlarged again,' Mr
Krogmeyer says.
For theatre and opera, two towers rise from the basement and a lighting grid
descends to form a conventional proscenium arch. The front of the apron
stage drops away to make room for an orchestra pit.
The basement contains an asymmetrical chamber music hall, not yet finished,
which will seat an audience of 500. Beside it is a self-contained recording
studio with thick concrete walls set on steel springs to eliminate
vibrations from passing traffic.
The main hall is also equipped to serve as a conference centre with
translation booths for 10 languages. 'It's designed so that you can hold a
congress into the afternoon and then be able to set up for a concert in the
space of three hours,' Mr Lambrakis says.
Looking further ahead, the aim is to encourage young Athenians to become
regular concert-goers. As a start, Mr Lambrakis intends to fit the courtyard
outside the Megaro with a giant screen for simultaneous projection of
performances going on inside. 'There would be no entrance charge. We'll be
helping young people to experience classical music through a medium they're
familiar with.'

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (12): Tribal feelings strained - The
pressure of immigrants from Albania and the Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWN AMONG the newspaper booths and merchant stalls in Omonia Square in
central Athens, clusters of thin, weather-beaten men chat quietly. Any time
of the day and much of the night they are there, dressed in old-fashioned
jackets and ragged bell-bottomed trousers.
These are the Albanians, some of the many thousands who have crossed over
into Greece in recent months. The Greek authorities say that to date more
than 20,00 Albanians have arrived in Greece. Some have returned but at least
12,000 look like becoming permanent residents.
Most of the new arrivals are members of the Greek minority in southern
Albania - a region that for long has been claimed by Greece and that is
referred to as north Epirus in the political textbooks.
For years, Greece had expressed its concern about the Greek minority in
Albania. Now, with the government in Tirana no longer capable of, or willing
to, implement rigid border controls, the minority is flooding out. To the
Greeks, their arrival is something of a mixed blessing.
However, Greece cannot turn back its north Epirot brethren. Athens is also
aware that the new immigrants will at least bolster the Greek population.
That is now a little over 10m. The birth rate is declining and there is much
concern about what is called 'the shrinking of Hellenism'.
But the immigrants from Albania arrive with only the clothes they wear and
with few skills. Most are farm workers in their early 20s. Greece faces
enormous economic problems and is ill-equipped to deal with an immigrant
influx.
Athens estimates the Greek minority in Albania to be more than 350,000
though the government in Tirana says it is 57,000. Mr Constantine
Mitsotakis, the Greek Prime Minister, has appealed to the Greek minority to
stay at home and await the outcome of political reforms.
Greece also faces pressures in dealing with other immigrants, both legal and
illegal. Thousands of Bulgarians have entered Greece from the north. There
are numbers of Poles living for the most part illegally in various parts of
the country. Members of Turkey's Kurdish community regularly ask for
political asylum.
The Pontians are one of the more intriguing groups to arrive on Greek soil
in recent months. Pontians are an ethnic minority of Greek origin who once
inhabited an area on the southern coast of the Black Sea - referred to as
'Pontos' in ancient Greek.
According to the Greek government up to 500,000 Pontians are now dispersed
through the southern Soviet Union. With the freeing of Soviet emigration
controls, more than 25,000 Pontians have already arrived in Greece. Few
speak modern Greek but this group is unlikely to be a heavy burden on the
state.
Pontians are the butt of Greek jokes in much the same way as the Irish are
to the English or the Poles in some parts of the US. But the Pontians are a
resourceful group who through even the toughest times in the Soviet Union
survived and often prospered.
In many parts of Athens, Pontians have set up stalls selling goods brought
from the Soviet Union. As new residents of Greece, they have taken advantage
of entitlements on car imports, buying luxury models and selling them for
handsome profits.
To cope with these new immigrant groups, the government has set up a special
bureau to co-ordinate educational and resettlement activities. It is a
formidable task, fraught with social and political dangers.
Already, some concern has been raised about government plans to settle
several thousand Pontians in Thrace - a region where Muslims predominate and
one of the poorest in the country.
Greece wants to welcome its 'returnees'. But it is fully aware that its
resources are severely limited. In some ways the homecoming could not have
come at a worse time.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (13): The other brand names are dead -
Profile, METAXA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Dennis Malamatinas, chief executive of Metaxa, says that his company
boasts one of only three successful Greek brand names: 'The others are
Onassis and Maria Callas.'
Tankers and arias are easier to identify than the contents of a bottle of
Metaxa. In Greece it is 'koniak,' but to the rest of the European Community
it is brandy. Ask a member of the Metaxas family which invented it a century
ago and you are firmly told: 'Metaxa is a unique spirit.'
It is also very varied. Three-star Metaxa is something you gulp down in the
village cafeneion on a winter morning before setting out to prune the vines.
The five-star version is found in Athenian bars at a fraction of the price
of cognac, though few fashionable Greeks are seen drinking it.
But seven-star Metaxa is the top-selling brandy in international duty free
shops, with sales of 1.5m cases a year.
Nevertheless, duty-free sales account for only 13 per cent of Metaxa
turnover, though more than 50 per cent of production is exported. Most is
drunk in Germany and Austria, 'by expatriate Greeks and people who like to
keep up with things Greek between holidays,' Mr Malamatinas says.
He joined Metaxa after the owners sold out in 1988 to Grand Metropolitan,
the drinks, food and retailing group, with a brief to 'transform a
flourishing traditional Greek family business into a dynamic part of a
multinational group.'
Mr Malamatinas has the kind of background to make the transition go
smoothly: a Greek born in Zimbabwe, he worked for Procter and Gamble in the
US and headed Pepsico's operations in Italy before moving to Metaxa.
His management team was picked, he says, on the basis of 'being
internationally oriented with an awareness of Greek business culture' and
asked to carve out a niche for Metaxa in the international fashion and
luxury goods sector.
The Metaxa distillery outside Athens has been modernised and capacity
doubled, at a cost of Dollars 4.6m.
Last year packaging and advertising for seven-star Metaxa was redesigned.
The amphora-shaped bottle was relaunched as 'the Greek spirit'. Sales in
1990 improved by 10 per cent.
Unlike most Greek businessmen bought out by foreign companies in the past
few years, the Metaxas family still keeps an interest in the spirits
business.
Mr Elias Metaxas, who used to be the company's chief taster, owns a
distillery in central Greece where he experiments with liqueurs and produces
a brandy to match any Metaxa. 'I am still fascinated,' he says, 'by anything
to do with alcohol.'

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (9): Why the timetable is slipping - The
progress towards privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE

<TEXT>
A RECENT survey of Greek industry caused a stir by pointing out something
the Finance Ministry knows only too well: the total amount of tax paid each
year by private sector companies falls considerably short of the overall
figure for losses incurred by public sector corporations.
It is not just the state-owned transport and utilities companies whose
payrolls are swelled by political appointees with little interest in
boosting productivity. The public sector also has a dominant role in
manufacturing though that is less visible, since many larger companies are
controlled indirectly through the state-owned banks. Others belong to the
Industrial Reconstruction Organisation, a state umbrella for a group of
debt-burdened companies nationalised in the early 1980s by the former
socialist government.
While the socialists were held responsible for weakening Greek industry
through selective nationalisations in sectors they considered strategic, the
seeds of today's crippling deficits were undoubtedly sown by the statist
policies of their right-wing predecessors.
However, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis is determined to reverse past attitudes.
The prime minister himself supervises a wide-ranging privatisation programme
launched immediately the conservatives came to power last April.
The companies to be privatised form a profile of Greek industry: among them
are shipyards, mineral processing units, a textile group, several paper
mills, a leading construction company and a group of co-operative dairies
that belong to the Agricultural Bank.
The original aim was to dispose of the 20-odd companies controlled by the
IRO as quickly as possible and encourage the banks to shed another 70
companies. As a parallel measure, legislation was passed permitting the sale
of up to 49 per cent of public sector corporations through the Athens Stock
Exchange.
To co-ordinate the process, the government issued official guidelines for
handling sales and appointed NM Rothschild, the British merchant banker, as
its privatisation consultant.
But the timetable has slipped badly and it now seems unlikely that this
year's budget forecast of Dr200bn (Dollars 1.2bn) in privatisation revenues
will be met. Only two small IRO companies have been disposed of, a
yachtbuilder and a plastics manufacturer. One partial privatisation has
taken place with the sale of a 49 per cent stake in Olympic Airways'
catering subsidiary to Abela, an international industrial caterer.
Valuations and appointments of financial advisers took longer than expected,
while potential buyers were fewer than anticipated given the surge in
acquisitions of Greek manufacturing units by both local and foreign
companies over the past two years.
Mr Yiannis Piperoglou, an independent consultant serving as secretary to the
government's privatisation committee, says: 'When we started, I was looking
forward to putting some deals together. But we all underestimated the legal
complexities of privatisation. The process will take years and getting rid
of the IRO companies is only a small part of it.'
Government officials admit that chairmen and managing directors of some
companies on the privatisation list have resorted to delaying tactics to
keep their jobs for as long as possible. Last year the IRO companies' losses
totalled Dr45bn and their accumulated debts reached Dr215bn.
Mr Mitsotakis remains adamant that the IRO must shut down at the end of the
year. This means in effect that a number of companies will be have to
liquidated since the IRO will be unable to continue its current practice of
extending deadlines in the hope of attracting better offers.
Further delays may be caused by a European Court of Justice decision in a
case brought by the former owner of an IRO company. The court is expected to
rule that the socialists' method of nationalisation, through a compulsory
increase of share capital, flouted Community directives on company law
because shareholders were not consulted.
Such a ruling could bring a spate of lawsuits against the IRO as other
former owners see a chance to recover control of their companies, or at
least to demand compensation from the government.
At the same time, Greek officials are having to stay in close touch with the
European Commission to make sure that terms of sale for larger industrial
companies, such as the heavily subsidised shipyards, do not run foul of
directives on fair competition.
Much attention is being focused on the upcoming sale of Heracles General
Cement, by far the best buy among the IRO's holdings and one of the few
companies slated for privatisation that has posted operating profits in
recent years.
While Heracles was being valued, the statist faction in the government
argued in favour of keeping it in the public sector. The company was
nationalised in 1983 with a capitalisation of debts totalling Dr27bn. The
move later allowed the IRO to gain control of 70 per cent of its shares.
Even before the government committed itself to selling Heracles, the
Commission had decided that this method of writing off debt violated
competition rules.
Despite the legal complications, there is no shortage of interest in
Heracles, said to be Europe's largest single cement exporter, among
international producers. The company's pre-tax profits totalled Dr11.9bn
last year on Dr41.6bn turnover.
The recent appointment as chairman of Mr Stelios Stavridis, a former
Heracles executive who left shortly after its nationalisation, is seen as
underlining the government's intention to speed up its sale.
'The company has deteriorated while under state control, but it is still in
reasonably sound shape. My job is not to get involved in running Heracles
but to accelerate the pace of privatisation. I don't intend to have to stay
here longer than nine months,' he says.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (10): A family business - The country's
political dynasties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUICK glance at the list of members of Parliament suggests that Greek
politics is still very much a family business.
The present and former prime ministers, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis and Mr
Andreas Papandreou, have a daughter and a son respectively in the House.
This is not really a coincidence considering that both leaders launched
their own political careers from similarly privileged backgrounds. Mr
Papandreou's father was a centrist prime minister. Mr Mitsotakis's
great-uncle, Eleftherios Venizelos, was Greece's leading modern statesman.
Descendants of the old tzakia, prominent political families whose influence
stretches back a century in some cases, are scattered around the front
benches in Parliament.
On the other hand, a political dynasty can be founded by present head of
state, Mr Constantine Karamanlis, a schoolmaster's son from Macedonia who
served as prime minister for 15 years. His youngest brother is a cabinet
minister and two of his nephews are up-and-coming deputies.
But the rumbles of complaint from members of Mr Mitsotakis's conservative
New Democracy party when he gave his daughter, Mrs Dora Bakoyannis, a junior
ministerial post, were an indication of how attitudes are changing.
As under-secretary to the prime minister's office, Mrs Bakoyannis is
responsible for co-ordinating government activities. She took over her
husband's parliamentary seat after he was killed by a local terrorist group
in 1989.
'I've been working for Mitsotakis for years. Now I represent one of the
poorest constituencies in Greece where a lot needs to be done,' she says.
'Politics is my life, and I'd like another cabinet job when I've got more
experience.'
Greek political parties have rarely outlived their founders, but both ND,
established by Mr Karamanlis, and Mr Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (Pasok) may have put down strong enough roots over the past 17
years to survive changes that are inevitable in the next few years.
Following Pasok's earlier example, ND constructed a more effective
grassroots organisation during its years in opposition. More younger members
of Parliament were selected originally as candidates on the basis of local
popularity rather than connections with the party hierarchy in Athens.
The frontrunner to succeed Mr Mitsotakis as ND leader, Mr Miltiades Evert,
is a seasoned Athenian politician but not from one of the old families. As
minister to the prime minister's office, he looks after civil service reform
and makes a point of keeping a distance from the party machine.
A year in opposition has taken its toll on Pasok. Funds are low and the old
populist enthusiasm is gone, especially in the countryside where the party
built its power base.
Mr Papandreou's personal grip on Pasok has slackened, but there has been no
attempt to unseat him. On the contrary, the start of his trial - in absentia
 -for alleged corruption while in office brought a closing of socialist
ranks.
The succession battle could turn out to be a long drawn-out affair, given
the doubts about Mr Papandreou's health since he underwent major heart
surgery in 1988 and the number of potential candidates.
Half a dozen former cabinet ministers are frequently mentioned, but it is
not at all clear which of them would appeal to both radical and social
democrat wings of the party.
Potential contenders are keeping a low profile until the court reaches its
decision, which may be several months away.
'The outcome of the trial will decide Mr Papandreou's political future,'
says Mr Costas Simitis, a former economy minister and the leader of Pasok's
social democrat faction.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (8): A new look emerges on the Piraeus
waterfront - There is something of a revival in shipping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Special Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING OF a 'new look' has emerged on the Piraeus waterfront in the year
since the conservative New Democracy party came to power. It started with a
decision by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, to take on the
shipping portfolio himself, a move seen by the community as long overdue
recognition for its contribution to the economy, as major employers and
earners of foreign exchange.
Day-to-day running of the Merchant Marine Ministry was left to Mr Aristotle
Pavlides, who eventually took over as minister six months later. By that
time, the prime minister's promise to address the shipping industry's
problems with 'imagination and daring' had resulted in new measures intended
to boost the competitiveness of Greek flag vessels in the international
market.
Tonnage tax on vessels of 80,000 gross tons was slashed by 75 per cent,
while ships from 40,000 to 80,000 gt were granted a 50 per cent reduction.
An extension of the tax breaks to smaller vessels is now under consideration
by the ministry.
The crew reductions removed up to five members from the complements required
on Greek flag vessels. To counter the outcry from seafarers' unions, Mr
Pavlides made it clear that this was mainly a paper exercise to normalise a
situation in which companies applied individually to use reduced
'experimental' crews.
The government has also acted on shipowners' long- standing complaints about
the dismal state of telecommunications in Piraeus. Efforts by the Greek PTT
to upgrade the system include a pilot project giving the port priority. By
June an extra 17,000 lines should become available, together with other
improvements.
Maritime education, another nagging problem in the eyes of owners, is also
being tackled. Some training schools that were expensive to maintain and not
fully used have been closed. Now the British sandwich-course training system
is being adopted and the ministry is consulting owners on further reforms to
be implemented in the 1991-92 academic year.
Though the government's moves were favourably received by the shipping
community, the number of vessels attracted to the national flag has remained
relatively small. This is largely because of factors over which the
government has little control.
Just as the tax and crew cuts were announced, a wave of strikes paralysed
banks, communications and power supplies for a three-week period. The
walk-outs underlined all too clearly the kind of problems that owners had
been pointing out for years. Piraeus shipping offices were forced to
relocate staff abroad temporarily, to keep in contact with their vessels.
In addition, a weak freight market and an uncertain outlook worldwide
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were more than enough to induce
hesitation about changing office location or flag.
Nonetheless, figures have improved. At the end of 1990, the Greek flag fleet
stood at 2,031 vessels totalling 22.53m gross tons, compared with 2,003
vessels of 21m gt at the end of December 1989.
Foreign exchange earnings from shipping soared by 29.3 per cent over the
same period to Dollars 1.79bn, the highest total since a 1981 peak of
Dollars 1.82bn. The trend continued in January this year with earnings
increasing by 21.1 per cent to Dollars 139m, against Dollars 111.5m in the
same month last year.
The fleet's accident record also improved, with incidents involving Greek
ships falling in 1990 to 54 from 58 the previous year. However, 51 lives
were lost compared with only nine in 1989, principally because of two
disasters.
Mr Pavlides stresses the need to rebuild a climate of trust between owners,
seafarers and the government. Unquestionably, the government's efforts have
made a difference. But Greek owners will continue to be market-oriented on
the whole. Unless it makes sound business sense, they will not opt for the
home flag or a Piraeus office.
Still, one indication of a revised perception of the situation in Greece
came with the announcement by the London-based Papachristides Ship
Management Services that it would transfer its ship management operation to
Piraeus this spring.
The shipowners' associations continue to emphasise their stated aim of
attracting new shipping and financial activities to Piraeus. But Greek
owners, individualists to the last, always look at the bottom line where
their own business is concerned.
One of the major issues, especially for smaller owners, is fleet
replacement. By the end of 1990 Piraeus banks were offering new types of
facilities to clients such as standby lines of credit for future vessel
purchases.
As ship values dropped in the second half of the year, Greek owners, with
their traditional knack for spotting a good buy, began to inspect vessels
with a view to purchasing. The Gulf war put a temporary brake on plans, but
since late February, owners have come strongly into the second-hand market
again, showing interest in a wide range of vessels.
At the same time, two Piraeus-based companies have revealed new building
orders for products carriers. One, Eletson Corporation, is already the
largest dedicated products shipping company in the world. The other, Forum
Maritime, is only now preparing to enter the wet trades.
Both new building contracts are for modern, highly sophisticated tonnage in
line with standards required for trading with the US. They are an indication
of the moves being made in the Greek shipping industry to slough off an
unflattering image of operating an elderly fleet, kept under tight family
control.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (7): Ending the nightmare - Investing in
the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BANKING IN Greece is not an easy business. One of the main hiccups is
communications. The telephone network, starved of investment for the last
two decades, is overloaded and outdated. Banks in the state sector are
chronically overstaffed. Labour problems are a common occurrence.
For the customer, even the simplest transaction can take a great deal of
time as tellers wrestle with telephones that don't work and piles of
paperwork.
Mr Panagis Vourloumis is the managing director of Alpha Finance, 'the
closest thing to a merchant bank in Greece', as he puts it.
'Our communications technology is years out of date. People cannot get in
touch with us so we lose business,' Mr Vourloumis says.
He feels that if there is not substantial investment and reform in the
banking sector soon, Greece risks being left behind not only by the more
advanced countries in the European Community but also by Spain and Portugal
which are already putting into place new banking systems. He believes that
Greece has expertise in many areas and could develop a proper financial
services industry.
'At the moment financial services are only an appendage of the banks. But
they could develop independently, for instance if offering banking expertise
and services to countries like Bulgaria and Romania - places where Greek
banks, more than the more developed institutions in Germany or the UK, have
a knowledge and feel for the way business is done.'
Alpha Finance has been approached by various east European countries but, Mr
Vourloumis says, it already has more than enough business in the home
market. 'Even with our communications problems, we can compete with the
foreign banks.'
Set up two years ago, Alpha Finance belongs to a group of financial services
companies founded by Credit Bank, Greece's largest private bank, which
include stockbroking, leasing, insurance and financial information services.
Credit Bank is the largest shareholder. Samuel Montagu also has a small
stake, with the rest of the institution's equity held by employees - an
innovation in the Greek banking sector.
In the past two years, with a dramatic rise in business on the Athens Stock
Exchange, Alpha Finance has been closely involved in helping several
companies go public.
Together with Credit Bank, it launched two mutual funds, a diversified
equity and a fixed income fund, the first of its kind in Greece. The two
funds manage more than Dr20bn (Dollars 110m) in assets.
Alpha Finance is also involved in the government's privatisation process,
carrying out valuations and acting as financial adviser on the sale of
several companies.
'Privatisation is a revolution in Greece. If it's successful, and for the
future of the country it has to be, then the whole economic outlook will
change,' Mr Vourloumis says.
He points out that as the recession bites deeper, 'some foreign institutions
have come to pick the crumbs from the Greek table - something we welcome
because it broadens the market.'
But Mr Vourloumis and other bankers accept that Greece is still viewed as a
bureaucratic nightmare for some foreign institutions.
While profit repatriation is permitted, bureaucratic stipulations result in
tortuous hold-ups. A combination of labour problems and telecommunications
difficulties has held up progress on automated banking. Cheques are almost
as rare as a free taxi in the Athens rush hour. The black economy encourages
cash transactions. It is not uncommon to see customers carrying briefcases
bulging with drachma in and out of banks.
'Setting up Alpha Finance was an expression of our faith in the future,'
says Mr Vourloumis. 'I am an optimist - things are going to change.'

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (5): Wealthy uncle becomes less indulgent -
The economy, Kerin Hope says it will be hard to avoid a revenue shortfall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN A Greek is in dire financial straits, he remembers his barba stin
Koroni - a wealthy uncle in a distant town.
Twice in the past six years, the government has done much the same thing,
seeking assistance from Brussels in the form of an emergency balance of
payments loan.
But the European Community, which granted Greece an Ecu2.2bn (Dollars 2.7bn)
loan in February, is much less indulgent than it used to be. Stringent
conditions were attached before the first tranche of Ecu1bn was paid.
If Greece is to participate in the next phase of European monetary union, it
must meet ambitious targets for reducing a chronically high inflation rate
and public sector borrowing requirement in the next three years.
Mr Efthymios Christodoulou, the economy minister, says: 'It's a basic
choice. Either you follow the other 11 (EC members) and make an effort to
submit to painful measures, or you stay on the periphery and see what
happens.'
To ensure the drachma can enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS by
the end of 1993, inflation must come down to 9.5 per cent that year, from
22.8 per cent in 1990. This year's target is 17.5 per cent.
Central administration borrowing, which totalled 13.1 per cent of GNP last
year, is expected to shrink to 10.5 per cent this year and reach a minimal
1.5 per cent in 1993.
The current account deficit must be limited to 3 per cent of GNP, compared
with an average of over 4 per cent for the past two years.
Other conditions call for the kind of reforms that Greek economic analysts
have advocated for years but governments were always reluctant to apply
because of the political cost.
They include a 10 per cent cut in civil service staffing levels by 1993, a
broadening of the tax base to include more farmers and an effective
crackdown on tax evasion by restructuring revenue collection.
Such strict conditionality is the result of the former socialist
government's failure to keep the terms of an Ecu1.5bn Community loan in the
mid-1980s.
Structural reform was largely ignored but the government managed to cut the
PSBR from 18 to 13 per cent of GDP and bring inflation down from 22 to 12
per cent before yielding to pressure for substantial wage increases.
These, together with an extravagant campaign to find public sector jobs for
socialist supporters in the run-up to the June 1989 election, quickly
dissipated the gains from two years of tight austerity.
Crucial economic decisions were postponed during almost a year of political
stalemate before the conservatives' narrow election victory last spring. Now
the government cannot afford any delay at all in implementing reforms if it
wants to benefit from a recovery forecast for 1993. By that time, another
election will be imminent.
One encouraging sign has been union willingness to accept pay rises well
below the inflation rate, following the abolition of automatic index-linking
of wages at the end of 1990. This year public sector employees will receive
nominal increases of 8 per cent.
In the private sector, a landmark agreement was struck that seems to
guarantee smooth labour relations for the next two years. The unions agreed
to a basic 12 per cent increase for this year and 9 per cent in 1992, when
inflation of 14 per cent is forecast.
In fact, inflation could drop below 17 per cent this year. 'Underlying
inflation, especially labour costs, is below the consumer price index, and
this year's target was set when the outlook for oil prices was much
gloomier,' said one analyst.
Growth this year will be restricted to less than 1 per cent, but even that
would be an improvement. Revised estimates for 1990 show negative growth of
minus 0.4 per cent, largely as a result of a sharp drop in agricultural
production after a disastrous drought.
The main challenge for the government is to meet its budget targets for
curbing public sector expenditure and increasing revenues.
There has been little sign so far that the deficit-plagued public sector
enterprises have reined in spending, though a new scheme requiring them to
submit monthly accounts to the Economy Ministry should impose more
discipline.
About 35 per cent of budget revenues are already earmarked for serving the
public debt. Even if the stabilisation programme meets all its targets,
overall debt will still total more than 90 per cent of GDP in 1993.
On the revenue side, the Finance Ministry is confident of maintaining last
year's growth in tax income of more than 30 per cent. But tax evasion
deprived the government of Dr350bn in revenues last year (Dollars 1.9bn),
equivalent to about 3 per cent of GDP.
Mr Yiannis Palaiocrassas, the finance minister, says: 'Much of the present
evil in the tax system stems from apparently contradictory provisions and
regulations that make it hard to determine when an enterprise is outside the
law. But it's true there is a lot of corruption everywhere.'
The black economy, estimated at 30-40 per cent of GDP, is under attack.
Buoyed by the success of its raids on night clubs and restaurants, the
ministry is setting up a 'tax commando unit' to frighten more proprietors
into producing correct receipts on their newly installed cash registers.
But the new income tax structure will not come into effect until 1993. In
the meantime, tax returns will be systematically cross-checked this year for
the first time.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the government is unlikely to collect
the expected income from its privatisation programme. The Industrial
Reconstruction Organisation was expected to sell about 20 companies under
its control this year. Due to lack of interest from buyers, it seems that
all but half a dozen may have to be liquidated instead.
Another important potential source of revenue, sales of land bonds
redeemable as building plots, is lagging behind schedule. If, as seems
likely, they are not introduced until late in the year, it will be hard to
avoid a revenue shortfall.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (6): Out go curbs, out go funds? - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF Greece officials are professing confidence that when restrictions on
long-term capital outflows are finally lifted next month, there will be no
large-scale flight of funds. But if a note of trepidation creeps into their
voices, it is hardly surprising.
The liberalisation, which will bring Greece into line with its European
Community partners by permitting individual Greek investors to buy property
and securities abroad, is already more than a year overdue.
Successive governments obtained an extension, citing a steadily worsening
current account deficit that reached Dollars 3.6bn last year, over 5 per
cent of GDP.
The deficit is shrinking only slowly, but a commitment was made to freeing
outward capital movement this spring under the terms of the EC emergency
balance of payments loan to Greece.
Mr Dimitris Chalikias, the governor of the Bank of Greece, belives the
benefits of liberalisation will quickly outweigh any adverse effects on the
balance of payments.
'We're not very worried about the effect on the current account deficit. It
won't be so large. The important factor is the confidence it brings, which
will encourage capital inflows as well.'
There are no longer any restrictions on inward capital movement, or on
direct investment abroad. Greek companies are already allowed to borrow from
foreign banks, in foreign currency if they wish.
But until last year, total Greek purchases of foreign securities were
limited to Ecu50m (Dollars 60m) yearly in EC and European Investment Bank
issues. At present, Greek mutual funds can place no more than 25 per cent of
their portfolios in foreign stocks.
The average Greek businessman still aspires to owning property in England or
Switzerland and a portfolio of Wall Street stocks, though the flourishing
equity and property markets in Athens mean such investments may be as much a
status symbol as a hedge against the spectre of political or economic
turmoil at home.
The Bank of Greece view is that the serious money has already left because
wealthy Greeks have little difficulty in bypassing regulations in order to
transfer capital abroad.
Mr Chalikias says: 'If we consider the structure of foreign exchange
receipts, invisibles are the most important item and private capital inflow
is a very large item. This structure makes it relatively easy for capital to
be exported unofficially.'
Nonetheless, a steady trickle of funds abroad can be expected as smaller
Greek investors experiment with purchases of foreign securities or buy
second homes in parts of western Europe where prices compare favourably with
those in Greece.
On a lesser scale, lifting the current yearly ceiling of Dollars 300 on
credit card purchases abroad, also included in the liberalisation, will add
to the outflow.
Once the initial shock is absorbed, 'this move will prove a catalyst for
changing the entire Greek financial landscape,' according to Mr George
Zavvos, European Parliament member who chairs the recently established
committee for the reform of the Greek financial system.
The committee's aim is to implement EC policy on banking and securities as
swiftly as possible. This involves preparing a considerable amount of new
legislation. While the Bank of Greece has been steadily deregulating the
banking system over the past five years, little has been done to overhaul
its legal framework.
Mr Zavvos, who used to work for the European Commission, should be the ideal
person for the job: he was responsible for drafting the Community's Second
Banking Directive.
'We have one of the most antiquated banking systems in Europe, so we needed
a mechanism for change. The image of Greek regulatory institutions needs to
be reformed. Integrity and efficiency are terribly necessary if we are to
start competing with the rest of the Community.'
The committee has already prepared legislative decrees on solvency ratios
and capital adequacy arrangements that will bring Greece into line with
standards worldwide. A law is being drafted on banks' accounting plans; a
much-delayed scheme for guaranteeing deposits is nearly complete.
Improvements in prudential supervision are also high on the agenda.
Testimony in recent weeks by Mr Chalikias and other Bank of Greece officials
at the trial of several former cabinet ministers accused of involvement in a
Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal at the privately owned Bank of Crete
revealed that, without government support, the central bank was unable to
mount an effective investigation of its own.
Once the new legislation is in place, the state-owned Greek banks, which
still control more than 70 per cent of deposits but have largely failed to
grasp the opportunities offered by deregulation, will come under much
stronger pressure to modernise, Mr Zavvos says.
'The state banks have a competitive advantage in their proximity to the
client plus their networks all over Greece. Their unions are weaker than
they used to be, so there is a chance to improve efficiency. But they need
up-to-date technology and management.'
For the 22 foreign banks, the reforms will mean 'a more level playing
field,' according to one foreign manager. Though the foreign banks complain
about the vagueness of existing legislation, it has not deterred them from
expanding their retail banking operations or from becoming the leading
players in handling mergers and acquisitions.
The revised framework will also reinforce the position of the two leading
private Greek banks, which between them hold 14 per cent of deposits.
Both have carved out profitable niches, expanding into leasing and brokerage
activities in recent years, while avoiding involvement with the loss-making
public sector corporations.
'The private banks have already done well out of deregulation. We're more
flexible. It's a question of quality of services. Our bank is modelled on
the kind of helpful high street bank that doesn't exist any more,' says Mr
Constantine Capsaskis, chairman of Ergobank, which looks after small
businessmen and is one of the most profitable banks in Europe.

IN THE wealthier parts of Athens, the mink coats come out during the short
spells of winter weather. The children of the wealthy - there are plenty of
them - while away their time in coffee bars or parade round the city in
expensive cars. House buyers still carry suitcases full of drachma to
complete cash purchases for properties which have recently risen to
London-style prices.
At times it is hard to reconcile life in Greece with the official
statistics: on a wealth per head basis Greece is now the poorest country in
the EC. It also has the worst economic health record in the Community. It
has been saved from financial pneumonia only by emergency treatment from
Brussels, in the form of a recently approved Ecu2.2bn loan - granted on the
strictest terms yet imposed on a member state.
1990 was the year when the EC finally ran out of patience with Greek
governments which seemed either unwilling or unable to put the country's
financial affairs in some sort of order.
Early last year Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
wrote a terse letter to the then 'ecumenical' government. He said the
deteriorating economic situation in Greece threatened the future not only of
the country but also jeopardised future developments within the EC. Greece,
said Mr Delors, was lagging behind the Community to the point where the EC's
'course towards the single market, monetary union and European unification
is in danger of being permanently undermined.'
Greece's creditworthiness was increasingly at risk due to a rapidly rising
public debt and other imbalances in the economy. 'We think it indispensable
that drastic measures be quickly taken to make clear the country's
willingness to reduce these imbalances for good,' said Mr Delors.
The direct language of the communication broke the delicate protocol the
Commission employs in its dealings with sovereign EC governments. The EC was
angry that Greece had failed to abide by the terms of a Dollars 1.7bn EC
emergency loan made in 1985. The message this time was clear: if Greece did
not put its economy in order, then the country risked being left behind by
the rest of the Community.
The new EC loan - finally approved in February this year - sets the
parameters of Greek economic policy for the next three years. The loan is in
three tranches and is set on what the Commission describes as 'strict and
comprehensive' conditions.
These include bringing inflation down from 17 to 7 per cent, cutting central
government borrowing from 17 per cent of GDP to 1.5 per cent in the 1990-93
period, a 10 per cent reduction in public sector employment, curbs on public
sector pay rises and a radical broadening of the tax base.
The government is in desperate need of the loan to cover a current account
deficit which totalled Dollars 3.2bn in 1990. The loan is also necessary to
ensure Greece's continuing creditworthiness as it goes to the market for an
estimated Dollars 3.6bn of foreign borrowing this year.
Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Prime Minister, denies that the terms of the
loan constitute an infringement of Greek sovereignty. 'What appears to have
been a set of conditions imposed from outside was in fact our policy,' says
Mr Mitsotakis. 'We told Brussels to tell us these things. Our economic
policy is a very courageous one and has various political and social risks
attached to it. But we are determined to carry out these vital reforms.'
Some Greek officials admit that the fact that Brussels is seen to be
imposing its terms on the future course of the economy has made life easier
for the government. In the divisive world of Greek politics it would have
found it hard to act alone. There could have been a series of damaging
strikes and social chaos.
There was some disquiet within EC ranks about the loan. Mr Mitsotakis says
agreement was reached only after consultations 'at a very high level'. At a
meeting of EC finance ministers in Milan last December it was suggested that
Greece should turn to the IMF for help. But Mr Delors and others have argued
that a solution to Greece's problems should be found 'within the family' of
the EC.
If Brussels shows signs of impatience with Athens, then many Greeks also
feel that the rich, well-developed countries of the EC do not have
sufficient regard for their country's particular problems - whether they are
ones of geography, politics or culture. 'We Greeks have been slow to learn
the intricacies of dealing with Brussels and have had difficulty in
co-ordinating our policies,' says one official. 'For that we are penalised.'
Like other countries on the EC's periphery, Greece feels it must be granted
some special treatment if, in the words of the Brussels bureaucrats, there
is to be 'a level playing pitch' between EC members.
On the macroeconomic level, Greece cannot be said to have made the most of
the opportunities offered by its 10-year EC membership. In 1981 Greek per
capita GDP was 58 per cent of the EC average: it is now 51 per cent. Large
inflows of EC money in the early 1980s were not used to make the fundamental
readjustments necessary in the economy.
Rather than modernise the agricultural sector by investing in agribusiness
industries, funds were used to import new cars or buy videos. As happened in
several other EC member countries, there was no proper supervision of
spending. EC monies helped the former socialist government of Mr Andreas
Papandreou to carry on the tradition of making political appointments to the
civil service and give electorally beneficial pay rises.
Mr Costas Simitis was national economy minister during the middle years of
the Papandreou era but resigned in 1987 when the former government, faced
with an election, abandoned its austerity programme. He admits that mistakes
have been made and that as a result Greece only has 'a weak voice' within
the EC. 'The trouble now is that the government does not have any specific
plan as to how it will bring about the reforms Brussels is asking for. For
instance, it has no idea about how to levy taxes on farmers,' says Mr
Simitis.
There is little talk of the unified market and 1992 in Greece. Ecu7bn of EC
structural funds covering the 1989-93 period may not be fully utilised due
to the lack of public and private matching investment. Of more immediate
concern are the implementation of wage agreements and bringing down
inflation.
Greek attitudes have changed. Greeks are firmly in favour of EC membership,
even if many still refer to Europe as 'over there'. 'We must make sacrifices
and fight hard to play our full part in Europe,' says a Greek official. 'If
we fail now, we risk being permanently marginalised.'

Kieran Cooke looks for changes in the country's foreign policy
</HEADLINE>

OPEN THE history books. Dust off the old maps. There is trouble again in the
Balkans.
The priorities of Greece's foreign policy have traditionally been Turkey,
Turkey again and then the US. Things are changing. Turkey is still top of
the list. But now the Balkans, a l o n g with the European Community, have
assumed greater importance.
In recent months foreign policy debate within the EC has been dominated by
the break-up of eastern Europe and the consequences of German unification.
But for Greece, problems in the Balkans are of far more concern.
'Our geographical position has always meant that we have special worries
about the Balkans,' says Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Prime Minister. 'Now
the problems in the region are acute.'
There is great concern about the possible break-up of Yugoslavia. Macedonia,
perched on Greece's northern borders, might become a break-away republic and
try to pursue what Athens terms as irredentist claims on Greek territory.
Turmoil in Yugoslavia would also have serious economic consequences. It
could put in jeopardy Greece's vital road links with the rest of the EC.
Mr Mitsotakis's government has worked hard to promote good relations with
the new regimes in Bulgaria and Romania. But Greece has been in something of
a quandary over recent events in Albania.
Earlier this year Mr Mitsotakis became the first Greek premier to visit
Tirana. A breakdown of Stalinist-type controls in Albania has meant a
partial opening of frontiers. Greece has suddenly found itself the rather
reluctant host to thousands of members of the Greek minority in southern
Albania. Having talked for years about the plight of this group in what is
known in Athens as North Epirus, the government cannot very well turn the
refugees back: Mr Mitsotakis has instead pleaded with them to stay in
Albania and await political changes.
But, as ever, Turkey remains at the centre of Greek foreign policy. 'The
problems between Greece and Turkey are still in the same old rancid state,'
says Mr Thanos Veremis of the Hellenic Foundation for Defence and Foreign
Policy. 'After Mr Papandreou (the former Greek premier) and Mr Ozal (the
then Turkish Prime Minister, now president) met in Davos in 1988 there was
talk of a rapprochement between the two sides, but nothing has come of it,'
Mr Veremis adds.
Greek a r g u m e n t s with Turkey focus on two issues. One is the
continuing Turkish presence in northern Cyprus, dating from the 1974
invasion. The other concerns various territorial claims - on the delineation
of the Aegean continental shelf, the extent of territorial waters and flight
controls in Aegean air space.
While the arguments might appear somewhat stale, they still have the
potential to erupt into open conflict. As recently as 1987, Greece and
Turkey were brought to the brink of war over rival oil exploration claims.
Suggestions that Greece has lessened its resolve in any way on the Cyprus
question are firmly dismissed by Mr Mitsotakis. He draws parallels between
recent events in the Gulf and the Cyprus question. 'I feel now that
conditions are better than ever for a settlement. The world reacted strongly
to the occupation of Kuwait. There is a foreign occupation in Cyprus. The
Security Council resolutions on the issue m u s t be i m p l e m e n t e d,'
says Mr Mitsotakis.
This view is unlikely to be echoed in Ankara. There are fears in Greece that
Turkish attitudes are hardening. The theory is that Turkish self-confidence
has been bolstered by its role as a vital support base for the allied forces
during the Gulf conflict.
Mr Antonis Samaras, the Greek foreign minister, has lobbied energetically in
western capitals to try to ensure that Greek interests are not forgotten. At
the same time, Mr Samaras has sought to reinforce relations with many
governments in the Middle East.
Greek officials admit that foreign policy, with the exception of attitudes
to Turkey, has lacked consistency. Mr Papandreou sought to weave a complex
set of relationships with the third world, with the countries of the Middle
East and with some of the now disgraced governments of eastern Europe.
During his term of office, there was much anti-US talk but behind the scenes
Athens remained close to Washington.
In the middle of last year Mr Mitsotakis became the first Greek premier to
make an official visit to the US in 27 years. He describes relations now as
'excellent'. A new agreement on US bases in Greece has been signed. Out of
the four bases one has already been closed through Pentagon cost-cutting
measures, while another is due to stop operating later this year.
But there are still some political difficulties between Athens and
Washington. Greece was angry about a State Department directive issued
during the Gulf war advising US nationals not to visit Athens.
More broadly, Greece is concerned that a Washington which is now more well-
disposed towards Turkey might try to upset the seven-to-10 ratio in military
aid given to Greece and Turkey. However, this ratio is more myth than fact -
for some time more US aid has been flowing to Turkey.
American officials in Athens say it is clear that the EC is now seen as 'big
brother' in Athens, rather than the US. Greece is among the most ardent
integrationists in the EC. It wants a common defence network and to become a
full member of the Western European Union (WEU). Some officials in Athens
say Turkey has been actively lobbying against the latter move.
Greece has been heartened by what it s e e s as increased EC interest in the
Cyprus question. Luxembourg, the present holder of the EC presidency, has
proposed some form of initiative on the issue: however, some EC members
clearly do not want the Community to be dragged into what is seen as an
argument between Greece and Turkey.
Last month Greece again used its veto within the Community to block Ecu600m
worth of EC aid to Turkey. The aid had been linked to progress on the Cyprus
issue. Greece said that if Turkey were to receive the funds, it would be
seen as 'a reward for Turkish intransigence.'
Again, some EC members were unhappy at this development. Greece recognises
that its interests are best served within the EC. But it is also beginning
to realise that there are limits to EC patience when it comes to old and
seemingly intractable arguments between Athens and Ankara.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (1): Awkward, but essential - After a year
in office, the Mitsotakis government is still trying to restructure the
economy and modernise public institutions. The challenge it faces is to keep
up the pace of reform without endangering the prevailing political consensus
</HEADLINE>

AT AN age when most politicians are putting the finishing touches to their
memoirs, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the 72-year-old Greek prime minister,
has undertaken the awkward task of making Greece more like other European
Community countries.
To succeed, he will need all the tenacity acquired during a career in which
the highest office always seemed to remain just beyond his grasp.
Though the socialists who ran Greece during the 1980s were mired in scandal
and clearly running out of steam, it was only after three elections and
almost a year of political uncertainty that the conservative New Democracy
party managed to scrape a one-seat parliamentary majority last April.
Mr Mitsotakis' chances of heading a stable government improved soon
afterwards when Mr Constantine Karamanlis, the veteran conservative
statesman who led Greece into the European Community a decade ago, was
elected president by parliament.
Mr Karamanlis has no executive powers as president - they were abolished by
the socialists - but as the founder of New Democracy, he wields considerable
influence in the party, especially among potential contenders for the
leadership.
He would almost certainly try to dissuade anyone who felt tempted to lead a
party rebellion aimed at forcing Mr Mitsotakis to retire and provoking a
fresh election. But given the magnitude of the country's economic problems
and the unpopular choices necessary to solve them, this is not likely to
happen in the near future.
Nor are the socialists putting up any serious opposition to the government's
three-year stabilisation programme. Indeed, Mr Andreas Papandreou, the
former prime minister, who was a keen advocate of state ownership while in
office, complained recently that the government was dragging its heels over
privatisation.
Mr Papandreou, also 72 and in uncertain health, has had some ups and downs
with his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) in recent months as would-be
successors started manoeuvring for position. There are several strong
candidates but, like their conservative counterparts, they seem prepared to
play a waiting game.
In any case, the start of Mr Papandreou's long-awaited trial, together with
three former cabinet ministers, on charges of involvement in the Dollars
200m Bank of Crete embezzlement scandal rallied the party behind him. Mr
Papandreou's refusal to take part in the proceedings, which he claims are
the outcome of a political conspiracy against him, have taken much of the
drama out of the case.
The vengeful mood of two summers ago, when the conservatives joined forces
with the communist-led Left Alliance in a short-lived coalition government
for the exclusive purpose of prosecuting Mr Papandreou and his closest
associates, has faded away. Mr Mitsotakis has nothing to gain from reviving
past bitterness if he wants to keep austerity on track and at the same time
project an image abroad of responsible leadership.
Were it not for a recent shake-up in the Left Alliance, Greek political life
would almost be dull. After a contentious Communist Party congress where he
helped the Stalinist old guard re-establish control, Mr Harilaos Florakis,
the elderly communist leader, finally stepped down. Even more surprising in
a country with only a handful of female politicians, both Communists and the
Left Alliance elected women leaders who have scarcely turned 40. However,
continuing internal battles suggest the Alliance is now more likely to split
than to play a more significant role.
In foreign policy, relations with the United States, always unpredictable in
the Papandreou era, have shown a marked improvement. The signing of new
agreement for the US military bases, once a focus for acrimonious political
debate, was barely commented on. After contributing a frigate to the
multinational force in the Gulf war, Greece is participating for the first
time in a UN peacekeeping force, on the Iraq-Kuwait border.
But Turkey's increased regional importance following the war is causing
concern, while long-buried Balkan issues have resurfaced amid increasing
instability along Greece's northern borders.
Criticism of the government's performance during its first year in office
centres on the sluggish pace of reform. At the political level, Mr
Mitsotakis had little difficulty in obtaining a special European Community
loan to avert an impending balance of payments crisis and also provide some
seed money for long-overdue infrastructure projects.
But fulfilling the terms of the EC loan, essential if Greece is to
participate in the next stage of European economic and monetary union, does
not just mean improving the economic indicators - though this is hard enough
after a decade marked by stagnating industrial output, runaway deficit
growth and a growing black economy.
As a former economy minister, Mr Mitsotakis knows that cutting civil service
payrolls, being less generous with state pensions, broadening the tax base
and curbing tax evasion will require a radical overhaul of the public
administration - and of attitudes among its employees.
The price of failure, the government is beginning to fear, could be Greece's
relegation to satellite status within the Community.
Mr Mitsotakis says: 'We have to apply these policies. I'm prepared to lose
the next election if I have to, but this is the only way forward.'
In fact, the fiercest opposition to change comes from within the
conservative party. New Democracy supporters, together with a number of MPs
and party officials, feel resentful that their leader is trying to break
with the traditional rousfeti system by which public sector positions, from
cleaners to bank governors, were redistributed by the winning party after
each election. After eight years in opposition, and with unemployment
rising, they want a share of the cake.
But if Greece is to bring the economy in line with single market
requirements, let alone catch up with Portugal and Ireland, old habits will
have to be cast aside. A new class of efficient, non-partisan administrators
must be found.
Improving the state education system is crucial: state schools are
ill-equipped and badly-paid teachers take out their grievances in prolonged
strikes. Last winter high school students around the country staged a
three-week sit-in. The protests flared into disturbingly violent street
protests in Athens after a teacher was killed in a riot.
As a short-term solution, the government is trying to attract younger Greek
bankers and economists back from abroad with a fair degree of success. But
only a limited number of talented diaspora Greeks can be expected to put
their careers on hold for the sake of helping out at home.
It will be much harder, for example, to train several thousand tax
inspectors and motivate them to remain honest in a system where superiors
often turn a blind eye to corruption.
And just in the year since the conservatives took over, a new generation of
kareklokentavroi, administrators who cling to their jobs at all costs, has
sprung up among the temporary managers appointed to oversee the
privatisation programme.
Still, Greek businessmen are feeling more cheerful. There is persistent
grumbling about interest rates that hover just below 30 per cent, but the
more efficient companies in the private sector are busy positioning
themselves for an expected surge in growth after 1992. Deregulation of the
labour market, with the introduction of flexible hours and part-time work is
also making life easier.
'There are problems in co-ordinating policy, between the public sector, the
private sector and local government for instance. The government lacks
management skills. But it's moving in the right direction,' says Mr Stelios
Argyros, president of the Federation of Greek Industries.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (9): Pressures mounting -
The US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SOUNDS like the antithesis of capitalism: in several US states
electricity supply companies can now raise their profits by persuading
customers not to buy their product.
The move is part of an energy conservation effort that underlines the severe
economic and environmental pressures facing the US supply industry in an era
of increasing competition, rising anti-pollution costs and huge capital
spending demands. A combination of all these forces has started to produce a
merger wave in the highly fragmented industry.
Since the early 1970s, US electric power utilities have been battered by a
combination of rising costs and increasing regulation on pricing, new plant
construction and other issues. Many are still paying for the nuclear power
plants ordered in the 1970s but then, abandoned or not, built on time or to
cost. According to the Edison Electric Institute, an industry body, the
companies are producing an average return on equity of about 10 per cent,
compared with the 13 per cent that state regulatory commissions usually
allow.
Foremost among the new challenges facing them now is the cost of complying
with last year's Clean Air Act which mandates that sulphur dioxide
emissions, a key component of acid rain, be reduced at coal-fired power
stations by about half by the end of the decade.
Utilities make some 60 per cent of their power from coal and they have two
choices in complying with the legislation. They can switch from burning
soft, high sulphur coal to hard coal, but this will push up transport costs.
Alternatively, they can install expensive flue gas desulphurisation systems,
otherwise known as scrubbers, or experiment with newer technologies such as
fluidised bed combustion. The Edison Institute says that meeting the demands
of the act will cost the industry up to Dollars 105bn (Pounds 58.60bn) by
2010.
In addition to modifying old plant, the industry is going to have to build
much new capacity over the next 10 to 20 years to replace old plant and meet
new demand. It is expected to add more than 90,000 net megawatts of new
capacity by the end of the 1990s.
Several factors have made the business climate more helpful to non-utility
companies which wish to generate power. The Bush administration, keen to
foster competition in the wholesale power market, has proposed in its
recently unveiled energy strategy to remove 55-year-old restrictions on
companies owning independent power stations.
The Public Utility Holding Act of 1935 has kept industrial companies out of
the power business and prevented utilities from building generating plant
outside their territories and then selling that power on the open market.
Other groups have been free to jump into this market: the Public Utility
Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 opened the door for small producers of
alternative energy to sell power on the open market.
Repeal of the 1935 law has stirred up controversy within the utility
industry, with some wanting the freedom to build stations around the country
and others unhappy at the presence of independents in their areas.
Federal regulators also want changes in control of utilities' transmission
lines. At present, while the utilities are required by law to buy power from
independents, they control the electricity after that.
The regulators would like to allow the independents to find their own
customers. That has brought howls of outrage from the industry, which argues
that the interlopers will simply steal their best clients.
All these factors are forcing some radical changes on the industry. The more
far-sighted utilities have been slashing costs and many have set up their
own independent power ventures. They have also turned to management of the
demand side through energy saving, prompted by changes in the regulatory
climate: regulators have begun to offer the companies a return on their
energy savings outlays which is broadly the same as the investment they have
been making in power plants.
The rule changes - instituted in states such as Massachusetts, New York and
California - have turned conservation from a costly chore for the utilities
into some of their most profitable operations. The so-called 'megawatt'
business involves handing out to customers efficient new equipment and
sharing in the savings by charging higher rates. The trend has brought
together some unusual bedfellows, with conservationists pleased that this
means less power station construction and utilities pleased that they are
spared the capital costs of new facilities.
The new competitive pressures are forcing the utilities to consider the
once-outrageous suggestion that they should get together in mergers. There
has been a rash of bids over the past year, including the industry's first
important hostile offer, when Kansas City Power &amp; Light made a run at
neighbouring Kansas Gas and Electric. Behind the merger wave lies a drive
for greater efficiency. Mr Edward Tirello, an analyst at Smith, Barney
Harris Upham, and a long-time merger advocate, estimates that about Dollars
3.6bn of annual cost savings for the industry could be generated through
more economic and efficient operation of plant.
The largest economies from consolidation would come from pooling - the
ability to use a more economic generating plant mix in the consolidated
service area during periods of low demand.
The long hand of the regulators could slow down this movement. Only last
month officials of the California Public Utilities Commission dealt a heavy,
though not yet fatal, blow to the 1988 proposed merger of South California
Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric, which would create the largest
utility in the nation. The officials agreed that the deal would provide
about Dollars 1bn of benefits to customers but complained that its
anti-competitive impact outweighed this.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (8): Investment will cut
the bills - Demand for energy efficiency is focusing on the generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY PLASKETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 20 per cent of the UK's energy bill could be saved by investing in
'cost-effective energy efficiency measures', according to Mr William
Rickett, director-general of the UK Energy Efficiency Office.
The scope for reducing energy use is not in doubt. Nor is the need to do it.
Carbon dioxide (CO), the main 'greenhouse' gas causing global warming, can
only be tackled by reducing energy consumption. Rather than meeting
increasing energy demand with increasing supply, existing supplies must be
used more efficiently. Demand for change will focus on the electricity
industry, an important contributor to CO emissions.
The UK has radically re-structured its electricity industry over the past
two years in preparation for the private sector. The restructuring arguably
offered a unique opportunity to incorporate incentives for energy efficiency
into the licences and the regulation of the new companies. The opportunity
was not taken.
Under the system in England and Wales, it is in everyone's interests to sell
electricity, and in no one's to save. The profits of the generators depend
on maintaining their market share. The profits of the 12 regional
electricity companies (RECs) depend on the amount of electricity they
distribute and sell. The duty to 'promote', not enforce, energy efficiency
lies with the regulator, Professor Littlechild. So far this regulation
consists of ensuring the RECs provide their customers with adequate
information on ways to cut consumption.
What privatisation may do is open up the generation side of the market for
new, more efficient technologies. Nearly all of the plant being built or
proposed today is based on combined cycle gas-fired turbines (CCGT) which
achieve greater efficiency levels than conventional coal-fired plant. It has
also raised the profile of combined heat and power (CHP), which has
potential efficiency levels of more than 80 per cent.
Critics point out that by splitting generation and distribution, and by the
regulatory formula used, the government has removed the potential to
introduce measures to curb demand, such as least-cost planning. This
involves a utility considering whether improving the end-use efficiency of
its customers is more cost-effective than building new generating plant.
Least-cost planning is being 'aggressively pursued' in about 20 US states,
according to Mr Mike Foley of the US National Association of Regulatory
Utility Commissioners (NARUC). Some state regulators require utilities to
explore both demand and supply-side options before licensing new capacity.
In most cases, utilities are then allowed to claim back a rate of return on
their investments in energy efficiency.
The employment of demand-side management is due to be expanded as part of
the new US National Energy Strategy (NES). Although the power industry at
first resisted this approach, many utilities are now finding it profitable.
These include New England Electric, Boston Edison and Pacific Gas and
Electric, three large, privately-owned utilities.
According to Mr Mike Monahan of Boston Edison, such demand-side management
is Edison's main focus because at 'the bottom line it is more cost-effective
to buy back electricity than it is to build new generating plant'. Boston
Edison will spend Dollars 250m (Pounds 139.6m) to 1995 on energy
conservation measures for its customers, including distributing compact
fluorescent lightbulbs, and offering free energy audits. In this way, it
shaved some 130MW off its peak demand growth in 1990; by 2000, it expects
the figure to be closer to 300MW-400MW.
One of the reasons this strategy works is that most US utilities are
vertically integrated and have a mandate to serve a particular area. They
therefore have an incentive to cut demand. The UK RECs, on the other hand,
are distributors and suppliers whose franchise market is due to disappear
over the next eight years. An attempt by the House of Lords to enable the
regulator, under the Electricity Bill, to enforce energy efficiency measures
before approving tariff increases was overturned in the Commons.
The structure of the European electricity supply industry is diverse, and
consequently the potential for least-cost planning patchy. Swedish
state-owned utility Vattenfall believes it could cut 12TWh-19TWh out of a
commercial and residential demand of 70TWh a year. The next phase, due this
autumn, is to discover how much of this potential can be realised.
According to Mr Morgan Andersson, project manager, the recent decision by
the Swedish government to delay the phase-out of nuclear power means that
'it is still vital to keep conservation measures going, but the commercial
incentive has changed'. Vattenfall now has no need for new generation until
2000.
Other Swedish utilities, notably Stockholm Energi, and some German utilities
have implemented demand-side management measures. Italy's state-owned
utility ENEL is a vertically-integrated monopoly supplier faced with growing
demand and increasingly unable to site new plant due to environmental
opposition. It has started to look at how to cut domestic demand by working
with manufacturers to promote more efficient electrical appliances.
A recent study for the UK Energy Department by the March Consulting Group
estimates that in the UK alone, replacing appliances with the best available
on the world market could save 24,000GWh of electricity.
The MCG report, along with the recently released Energy Select Committee
report on energy efficiency, comes to the now familiar conclusion that
improvements are unlikely to happen without government intervention. Schemes
to label appliances according to their efficiency have been introduced by
France, Denmark, and Germany with varying degrees of success, but no
European country has implemented labelling fully.
Again, the US record is impressive, with the 1987 National Appliance Energy
Conservation Act setting minimum standards for domestic appliances. The
recent NES is set to expand this. A number of US utilities also offer
customer rebates for buying efficient electrical appliances.
Meanwhile it may be left to international legislative moves to take energy
efficiency to the top of the agenda. Movement may be slow, but environmental
legislation is set to grow increasingly stringent. The European Commission
has already issued a directive setting standards for SOx and NOx emissions
from power plants.
An EC draft directive calls for compulsory labelling for most domestic
appliances in member states from July 1992. Minimum standards are set to
follow.
Future pressure from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climatic Change to cut
global CO emissions may force utilities and governments to try a little
harder.

divided - Japan is torn between nuclear commitment and green issues

CAUGHT BETWEEN surging demand for electricity and the government's
commitment to environmental protection, Japan's electric power producers and
the ministry that rules them can see only one panacea: nuclear power.
Japan lacks energy resources, so nuclear power generation is vital because
otherwise the nation depends on foreign sources and is vulnerable to
unpredictable fuel costs.
In late February, in Niigata prefecture, the No 2 reactor of Tokyo's
regional electric power supplier was shut for six days and restarted at the
end of the month after an accident attributed to human failure.
Earlier that month, a nasty contretemps at the Mihama Nuclear Power Plant
occurred when the day after a minor accident at the plant, local residents
received leaflets from the power company declaring the facility
accident-proof. While neither incident seems to have caused injuries or
contamination outside the plant itself, they may help to revive the agendas
of anti-nuclear groups.
It has been nearly five years since the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (Miti) began reducing power companies' rates, to pass to consumers
the benefits of soaring profits ushered in by the strong yen and cheap oil
prices. But then the price of oil went up. In the year ending March 31 1990,
pre-tax profits at Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) fell to Y185bn
(Pounds 770.83m) from the previous year's Y275bn-plus, a far cry from 1987,
when the company raked in more than Y444bn. Pre-tax profits for the year
ending March 31 are estimated at a dismal Y95bn.
Add to that the likelihood that the government will slap a tax on petroleum
products to cover around 10 per cent of the Dollars 9bn to be provided in
support of the allied forces campaign in the Gulf, and things could get even
worse. An industry report from Jardine Fleming Securities in late January
said: 'Doubling the tax rate could plunge EP (electric power) companies into
the red and necessitate a rate hike.'
Rate negotiations between the government and the companies occur annually.
An increase could be approved this spring, depending on the direction of
interest rates and oil prices, the report added.
According to Tepco, the company can still make 'reasonable profits' without
a rate increase, thanks to Japan's continuing economic expansion and
enormous demand from the Tokyo region. Underscoring its long-term resilience
are the triple-A ratings assigned to the company's outstanding foreign and
domestic bonds (total: around Dollars 11bn), and the high rating of its
Y300bn in commercial paper.
The Jardine Fleming report noted Tepco's high 71.5 per cent ratio of
interest-bearing debt to capitalisation, but added that 'interest rate
movements cannot justify all the changes over time in EP company
profitability'.
Tepco says it will 'overcome' and 'survive' the risks ahead. The company is
reducing dependence on oil, while capital outlays for nuclear power plant
construction since the 1970s are claimed to have made it less vulnerable to
fossil fuel price vagaries.
The biggest private sector electric power concern in the world, Tepco is one
of nine Japanese regional publicly-held electric power companies which
together produced almost 75 per cent of the country's 798,756m kWh of total
electric power output in 1989-90.
All the regional power companies are dealing with intensifying competition
by diversification into such fields as heat supply services,
telecommunications and urban development.
Tepco used nuclear fuel sources for nearly 30 per cent of its total
generation (205bn kWh) in 1989. The company relied on LNG-based generation
for 36 per cent of output, while oil dependence was 28 per cent. In the
electric power industry as a whole, nuclear powered electricity output
accounted for around 23 per cent of total electricity generated in Japan in
1989.
The government's fixation on nuclear power generation is not new. The
country revved up its first commercially operated nuclear power station in
July 1966. The 1970s oil shocks were something of an apocalypse:
construction started on no fewer than 22 nuclear plants during the 1980s. At
present the country has 38 nuclear power plants with another 13 under
construction and several more on the drawing board.
Already three other regional electric power companies - Kansai, Kyushu and
Hokuriku - generate more than 40 per cent of their total outputs from
nuclear sources, while Shikoku Electric Power generates 38 per cent from
nuclear. The heavy reliance by the regionals on nuclear-sourced power has
made them prime targets for anti-nuclear protesters, who have successfully
stalled construction of several new reactors.
By 2010, Miti, which regulates and sets strategy for the power companies,
intends to double the number of reactors to 78 and boost nuclear power
supply to 43 per cent of total electric power generation.
While Miti officials claim the anti-nuclear movement has lost momentum since
the Chernobyl disaster, the ministry is not taking the opposition threat
lightly. It plans a nationwide three-year PR project later this year
directed at specific groups, including housewives, teenagers and company
employees.
The ministry's strategy is to target the moderates, instead of reacting
directly to the anti-nuclear movement. The project includes a personal
computer-style network that provides information and news on nuclear power
in public places and at nuclear plant sites. PC-owners can dial a phone
number to access the network and the ministry will monitor public opinion
through questionnaires and by telephone.
As part of its effort, the ministry is also distributing free about half a
million copies of a glossy, 100-page brochure crammed with pictures,
diagrams and flow charts.
In spite of having to close a reactor at its plant in Fukushima, north of
Tokyo, for nearly two years after a breakdown in January 1989, Tepco's
current nuclear construction schedule has 'no symptom of delay,' the company
says.
A shift in Japanese political balance appears to brighten the future of
nuclear power generation. The Social Democratic Party of Japan (formerly the
Socialist Party), a strong foe of all things nuclear, seems to have
squandered the opportunity it gained in elections last year. Amid its
disarray, the SDPJ looks incapable of mounting public support to counter the
government's nuclear power commitment.
But short-term difficulties persist. If this summer is as hot as the last,
the industry could blow a fuse. Last July, Tepco met a record surge in power
demand by reportedly getting a big kilowatt injection from other regionals
and by urging consumption restraints to ward off power cuts. Miti says it is
boosting needed transfers of AC from one generating plant to another when
shortages occur.
In a further effort to take the heat off electric power companies, Miti says
it is expanding its policy of offering discounts to big industrial
consumers, such as steel, car and chemicals producers, that agree to cut
power use during peak demand times.
A recent Credit Suisse industry report said 65.7 per cent of the country's
total electric power demand (including supplies from independent generators)
in 1989 was for commercial and industrial use.
The ministry is also trying to curb residential demand that has rocketed
owing to the rapid proliferation of home air conditioners.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (7): New image for state
monolith - France, EdF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH state-owned power utility, Electricite de France is striving to
break away from its past as a relic of central industrial control.
The group's independent-minded managers are acutely conscious that EdF
stands out in a world where governments are tending to withdraw from public
utilities. They want to change that image, to help EdF advance in the export
markets it sorely needs.
After the privatisation and break-up of Britain's electricity industry, EdF
is left as the only electricity monopoly in Europe responsible for all of
its system, from power generation through to the distribution to customers.
It is this strong central organisation, under the continued control of the
Industry Ministry, which has allowed EdF to pursue a consistent pro-nuclear
investment policy since France's decision to build its own nuclear energy
source in the wake of the 1973 oil price crisis.
This has left France today more dependent on nuclear power than any country
in the world. EdF draws more than 80 per cent of its electricity from its 57
reactors, providing the cheapest electrical power of any European Community
country apart from Denmark, a significant advantage for French industry.
Yet the French nuclear power programme has been criticised as
over-ambitious, having produced a surplus of seven to eight reactors,
according to one official report. It attracts sporadic criticism from
France's vocal but surprisingly disorganised environmental lobby, although
not enough to cast serious doubt on France's nuclear consensus.
For these and purely technical reasons, EdF does not plan to increase its
proportional dependence on this source of energy, say officials.
While the state has reduced its influence on EdF's decisions, as it has
across France's nationalised industries, the utility's top managers are
beginning to see government control - especially on pricing - as a hindrance
to their bid to strengthen EdF as the EC's biggest energy exporter.
EdF's cross-border energy sales rose 8 per cent last year to 46.5bn kWh or
12 per cent of the total and the group wishes to raise exports to near 20
per cent of the total by the end of the decade.
At the same time, the group aims to play a significant part in the
replacement of ageing reactors in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Over
the past two years, EdF has delivered a computerised reactor safety
monitoring system to the Soviet Union and opened negotiations for joint
ventures to build reactors in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It also looks set
to emerge in the next few months as the main foreign company to be allocated
a stake in eastern Germany's electricity supply industry.
The export drive is partly designed to help mop up EdF's nuclear surplus,
but also to help run down the FFr226.1bn (Pounds 22.3bn) debt load that EdF
has built up as a result of the nuclear programme, and to earn the cash
needed to update some of the older reactors.
Already, the French utility's international ambitions have caused anxiety in
politically influential German coal-producing regions, worried about the
threat of cheap imported nuclear electricity accelerating job losses in the
mines. And in Britain, EdF's attempts to sell excess power at advantageous
rates to industrial customers in France have attracted competitors'
suspicion.
Mr Jean Bergougnoux, EdF's managing director, points out that it is hard to
persuade EC competition authorities that he is not dumping electricity when
his government runs a pricing policy that squeezes EdF's profits. 'A company
like EdF must have balanced accounts if it is to be perceived as a fair
competitor,' he says.
In theory, EdF's contract with the Paris government obliges it to hold price
rises at 1.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation. Yet in practice,
the government has, until recently, tended to hold rates lower than that,
with the result that EdF has made losses for six out of the past 11 years.
The powerful Finance Ministry argues that cheap power helps curb inflation
and so supports the value of the franc, an idea which provokes the derision
of Mr Pierre Delaporte, EdF's sometimes outspoken chairman. 'If we were
convinced that the delay in allowing us to raise our tariffs was necessary
to keep the franc safe on the international foreign exchange markets, we
would gladly sacrifice on the altar of the fatherland, but we do not believe
it for a moment,' he said recently.
However, in February, EdF received the go-ahead to increase prices by 2.2
per cent, as against the 2.8 per cent general inflation rate forecast for
1991 - a rise greeted as 'moderate' by Mr Delaporte.
Certainly, EdF is gradually beginning to look more like a commercially fair
competitor than a state monolith. It is now 10 years since it last received
a subsidy from the government.
EdF even managed to produce a profit in 1990, partly thanks to an increase
in exports and also reflecting the first fruits of a plan to cut costs by
FFr1bn.
Mr Bergougnoux believes that it is only a matter of time before the rigours
of EC competition law force the government to give him a freer hand on
prices. As he pointed out in a recent interview: 'European competition will
in the end have its effect. Brussels will remind the government that the
electricity market will conform to competition rules.'

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (4): Moulding a
management culture - The UK's privatisation process puts it at the forefront
of changes in the industry: FT writers look at aspects of the new structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE run-up to its privatisation last month, National Power, the largest
electricity company in the UK, issued its managers with a little blue book.
'Transforming National Power' was a hymn of praise to change. It was written
by a management consultant who had been appointed as the personal adviser on
new working practices to Mr John Baker, National Power's chief executive.
'Lean', 'flexible', 'open', 'entrepreneurial' and 'commercial' are the
buzzwords running through the booklet.
'Committee Rule was the old philosophy,' it enthuses. 'Now the ability to
take individual management decisions must become accepted behaviour - in
fact, people who respond quickly and effectively without going through the
hierarchy will be encouraged.'
It would be easy to poke fun at the often over-simplied homilies which make
up much of its 65 pages. Yet the message it contains would come as a shock
to most managers in many of the state-owned, monopoly-protected utilities
which still characterise much of the electricity industry worldwide.
Changing the management culture was one of the most important tasks that
National Power's top executives set themselves in preparation for
privatisation. Mr Baker and his immediate lieutenants have been stung by
frequent taunts, not least from the City, that National Power was slower
moving and more bureaucratic than PowerGen, its smaller rival. If that were
not bad enough, the lessons of previous privatisations, such as those of
British Gas and British Telecom, spoke volumes about the difficulties facing
utilities in adjusting to the cold wind of the private sector.
Each of the company's 35 power stations has been turned into a profit
centre, with the station manager held clearly responsible for financial
performance. A sharper system of financial reporting links power station and
head office. And ramming the message home is a new performance pay scheme
which can determine up to 30 per cent of a manager's salary.
Such initiatives will inevitably take time to work through. Meanwhile,
National Power has articulated a range of other strategies for improving its
performance in the private sector. Top of the agenda is cost cutting.
National Power has already shed about 1,000 jobs, reducing its workforce to
just over 15,000. That leaves its stated target of losing another 4,000 jobs
over the next five years, although industry observers will not be surprised
if that target is exceeded.
Two thirds of the job losses are likely to come from power station closures,
with the rest from more efficient working across the company. In the past
year, National Power has shut five of its coal-fired stations, contributing
just over 1,000MW towards its stated goal of closing 3,000MW of capacity by
the middle of the decade - a target which the prospectus warns might be
exceeded.
Not only does closure help cut costs; it is also central to National Power's
fuel strategy. The company wants to reduce its dependence on fuel from
British Coal, switching instead to gas, because gas-fired stations using
combined cycle technology are quicker to build, cheaper to run and more
environmentally friendly.
The other plank in National Power's fuel strategy is an increase in coal
imports, which are typically cheaper than supplies from British Coal.
Overall, Mr Baker plans to cut National Power's fuel bill by about Pounds
250m, or 10 per cent, within about five years.
But National Power is bound to remain heavily dependent in the medium term
on British Coal, which will supply National Power with about 43.6m tonnes of
coal this year.
Indeed, National Power's directors were only prepared to commit themselves
in the privatisation prospectus to 'a progressive dividend policy' until
1993, the expiry date for the coal contract and the other arrangements
nailed in place by the government to give the industry stability in its
early years in the private sector.
After 1993, the prospectus warned, 'National Power will be operating in a
more competitive market, and revenues will be sensitive to the balance
between demand and available capacity and to other market conditions.'

BEING SMALL has its advantages. As Napoleon, Tamburlaine, and countless
famous others have found, it can strengthen the resolve.
PowerGen, the smaller of the two electricity generating companies, has
already proven both shrewd and assertive. Since the early days of its
privatisation, it has come across as the friendly face of generation. But
within the velvet glove the management is keeping a firm, if not an iron,
grip on the newly created electricity market.
There are few signs of a public sector mentality at PowerGen. Chief
executive Mr Ed Wallis, who has been in the industry since he was fifteen,
is no bureaucrat, but a sharp and direct, hands-on manager.
Having got over the fracas when Mr Robert Malpas, the company's chairman,
left the company just before its privatisation, the board is now a
close-knit team.
Although smaller than National Power, PowerGen is by no means small. It
supplies around 9mMW hours of electricity, to 100 customers - on average
slightly smaller customers than National Power - and has 21 power stations.
It will make a pro forma profit before tax of Pounds 264m in the year ending
31st March 1991, and expects to pay dividends of Pounds 43m, according to
the flotation prospectus.
But it has done its best to capitalise on seeming small and approachable.
'The customer is king,' says Mr Wallis, and the company made a point of
offering the regional electricity companies, its largest customers,
customised packages of electricity.
It has won other customers like this: Toyota was seduced with a tailor-made
contract and was the first large industrial customer to sign to take
electricity directly from a generator.
But this accommodating philosophy did not stop PowerGen from competing
fiercely with the regional companies to supply large customers, during
recent bargaining rounds. PowerGen had been very aggressive, several
regional companies reported, and was undercutting their offers.
Not so, says Mr Roberts. 'We offered the same prices to the regional
companies as we did to direct customers.' But PowerGen does not deny it is
keenly interested in winning more large customers.
The company's attitude to price is, similarly, hardheaded. Electricity is,
Mr Wallis says, a commodity, and despite all the talk of customer relations
there is no chance the company will forget the importance of competitive
pricing.
PowerGen has been equally vigorous in its approach to fuel purchasing and
particularly in diversification away from traditional coal-fired generation.
It was the first generator to commission a new combined cycle gas turbine
power station, and has secured gas supplies for a 680MW station at Rye House
in Hertfordshire, as well as the 900MW Killingholme station on Humberside -
which will take all the gas from the North Sea Pickerill field in the first
such single field deal.
PowerGen's commitment to new gas technology is matched by its interest in
the latest coal technology. It has invested in a British Coal project at
Grimethorpe in Yorkshire, which is developing combustion technology to burn
coal more cleanly, and has joined the US electrical power research
institute, EPRI, which has made considerable investment in clean coal
technology.
The company has already invested Pounds 250m in flue gas desulphurisation
(FGD) technology which scrubs the gases that leave coal-fired stations for
its Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottingham.
But PowerGen is also looking hard at importing foreign, low sulphur coal.
Four out of its five large coal-fired power stations have easy access to
coastal terminals, making it easy to import, as the company has pointed out.
It is pursuing a policy of diversification away from UK coal.
Whether innovation will actually help PowerGen compensate for its size is
another question.
It is already true that National Power has more control over the bidding
which sets the electricity price in the pool, or spot market, simply because
it has more power stations than PowerGen. This, however, may begin to change
as more independent power stations come onstream.

'LIKE A system of outdoor relief for the City,' is how Mr Frank Dobson,
shadow energy secretary, has scornfully described the long list of advisers
involved in the complex privatisation of the electricity industry.
Certainly the number of people who have been drafted in is large. Last
autumn, one estimate put the total on the government's side at about 700,
and that was excluding those working on the Scottish sale.
Yet the merchant bankers, solicitors, accountants, stockbrokers and printers
involved in the privatisation process hotly deny they are overly rewarded.
'It has tied up lots of our people and frankly we could have made more money
out of doing something else.' said one merchant banker.
It is not surprising that advisers have found it irksome. The telephone
directory-sized prospectus for the 12 regional electricity companies (Recs)
had advisers working a seven-day week from last August to the start of
November.
But while in the run-up to the Recs' Pounds 5.2bn flotation there were no
conflicts of interest between government advisers and those looking after
the companies, during negotiations over the generators, relations between
the Department of Energy and Lazard, representing National Power and SG
Warburg for PowerGen, became ever more fraught.
This was partly because the government kept changing its mind about how to
sell the companies, before they were eventually floated jointly on the
market in February.
Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, sprung a nasty surprise on PowerGen last
summer when he flirted with the idea of selling it in a trade auction,
underwritten by Hanson, the industrial conglomerate.
SG Warburg had found itself in the complicated position of being told to
erect a Chinese wall inside its corporate finance department, between those
people advising the independent directors of PowerGen and those advising the
managers on a mooted MBO. Then in August Mr Wakeham executed an about-turn
and reverted to the idea of floating the company.
Another surprise came in January when the Department of Energy decided to
sell 60 per cent instead of 100 per cent of the shares in the companies'
combined flotation.
The companies' advisers complained that they had not been properly consulted
on the decision. Many felt the decision had been taken against the advice of
Kleinwort, the government's financial adviser.
But despite all the bitterness that had arisen, the department still
believed it could congratulate itself on its handling of the City during the
sale
because it managed to introduced a number of unusual features into the
flotation structure.
These altered the relationship between the government and the underwriting
institutions, marking a departure from the traditional underwriting method,
whereby investors were allocated shares simply in relation to their
weighting in the London equity market.
However, this would not encourage institutions - who know they would get a
certain amount whatever ludicrous level they suggested - to be forthcoming
in discussions about how the shares ought to be priced. Instead, Kleinwort
carried out a bookbuilding operation based on practice in the Euro-equity
market. Here, institutions were asked to say precisely how much stock they
would take within a range of prices. Those prepared to buy at the keenest
prices were favoured when allocations were made.
There was a further reshuffling of shares between underwriters, just before
stock market dealings started. This so-called 'back-end tender' was designed
to ensure that at least part of the sale - 16 per cent - would be sold at a
price reflecting that at which the shares would start trading, some two
weeks after the 100p partly-paid issue price had been struck.
In the tender, underwriters were invited to rebid for shares at levels above
100p, being required to pay the price they bid. The tender added Pounds 42m
to the Pounds 2.16bn flotation proceeds.
Despite initial concerns that the City would not stomach these ideas, Mr
Wakeham was sufficiently encouraged by the results to declare the flotation
a 'text-book exercise'.
But another surprise was to come. Nomura, the Japanese securities house,
which had not bid aggressively in the back-end tender, began buying large
amounts of stock in the market. This for a short time, pushed the shares to
premiums as high as 140p compared with their 100p partly-paid price - just
what the department and Kleinwort had gone to such trouble to avoid.
Nomura's reasons are still not entirely clear, but it has said it was unable
to bid heavily in the tender to satisfy strong demand at home because of a
Ministry of Finance rule covering offers for sale - the method by which the
shares were being distributed in Japan while the tender was going on. This
would have prevented Nomura offloading shares acquired in the tender at
prices above 100p.
Daiwa, lead manager for Japan in the Scottish companies' sale, is currently
in discussions with the Ministry of Finance to find a way round this
problem.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (2): Greens urge sales
reduction - The Environment

DRAW YOUR curtains at dusk. Use a toaster to make toast. Dust your
lightbulbs frequently. They may sound like commonsense, but these household
hints are a central plank - although some say a shaky one - of the UK
government's environmental strategy for the electricity industry.
They come from Yorkshire Electricity's recently published Code of Practice
on the efficient use of electricity. Under the regulations of the new
electricity industry, each regional electricity company must publish such a
code, helping the public get more value from each unit of electricity.
The industry rarely talks about using less electricity, environmental
lobbyists such as Friends of the Earth point out. 'A reduction in
electricity sales is needed to reduce the threat of global warming,' the
group insisted in a document published in October last year.
Electricity is, Friends of the Earth says, 'Britain's number one
contributor' to both global warming and acid rain.
Every unit of electricity (kWh) used, the group points out, means the
emission of nearly 1kg of carbon dioxide (CO), one of the 'greenhouse'
gases. The UK electricity industry is responsible for around 33 per cent of
the CO released into the atmosphere every year.
It is also a leading producer of the gases that cause acid rain - nitrogen
oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxides (SOx), annually releasing around 0.8m
tonnes of NOx - 71 per cent of the UK total - and 2.6m tonnes of SOx - 29
per cent of the national total.
There are two basic ways to deal with the problem - developing technology to
generate electricity more cleanly and efficiently; and using less of it, or
energy efficiency.
Japan is often held up as a model - its energy ratio is 2.7 compared with
the UK's 4.2, undeniably helped by the fact that energy is expensive. It
also has a package of stringent regulations enforcing energy efficiency such
as labelling for electrical appliances, setting building standards and
giving incentives for energy saving measures.
The UK government has begun to go the same way - although not far enough,
its critics say. It will spend Pounds 26m this year on grants to help low
income households use less energy, and will probably introduce a voluntary
appliance labelling scheme next year.
In addition, under the new electricity industry regulations, all users pay a
levy on electricity generated from fossil fuels which then goes to fund more
environmentally friendly methods of producing electricity. All the regional
electricity companies, moreover, must take a certain percentage of their
electricity from these 'renewable' sources, such as wind or wave power.
The government's white paper on the environment sets a target of 1,000MW to
be generated from renewables by the year 2000, and has further said they
could provide 24 per cent of UK energy by 2025. But from the electricity
industry's point of view, what really matters is finding ways to make fossil
fuel production of electricity cleaner.
The industry is under pressure - new UK legislation, under the auspices of
the EC, will require power stations to cut SOx emissions to 60 per cent
below 1980 levels by 2003, while NOx must be 30 per cent lower than in 1980
by 1998.
And the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), has set a target of
stabilising CO at 1990 levels by 2005, with which the UK has conditionally
complied.
There are three main options for the industry. First, it can clean up after
combustion of coal or oil, notably by fitting scrubbers known as 'flue gas
desulphurisation' or FGD units to the power station chimneys, which clean
the gas as it leaves.
This is the route the UK has so far adopted - 8,000MW of FGD are being
fitted at present. However, few people regard this as an adequate long-term
solution: FGD does not deal with NOx and critics point out that 8,000MW is a
negligible amount compared with continental FGD installations.
The second option is to switch into another fuel. Natural gas is the
frontrunner. It releases very little sulphur or nitrogen, and burnt
efficiently in a new 'combined cycle gas turbine' station (CCGT) which
recovers waste heat from combustion to drive a steam turbine, it is around
50 per cent efficient compared with 37 per cent at best for a conventional
coal fired station. This means less CO is released per unit of electricity
produced. Most of the new power stations due to come onstream in the mid-90s
in Europe will be CCGT.
The third option is to devise technology that burns coal more cleanly. In
Europe and the US a new generation of coal-fired power stations is being
developed. By the 1990s they will be up and running - and green enough,
their creators say, to compete with gas.
There are other variants: in the UK British Coal has masterminded a process
 -known as 'the topping cycle' which combines partial gasification with the
new combustion technology. These clean coal technologies can cut emissions
of sulphur by up to 99 per cent, and nitrogen by between 80 and 90 per cent.
By improving efficiency from 35 per cent to up to 46 per cent they also cut
CO emissions.
The UK has no plans for any clean coal plant. The government has invested
around Pounds 20m in clean coal research, and is currently conducting a
review of the area, which may result in further investment later this year.
So far the money to fund a clean coal plant - a new technology that involves
commercial risk so cannot win City backing - is just not there.
Ultimately, however, it will only be built when the two electricity
generators order it, and while gas continues to be cheap and available, they
are very unlikely to do so.
But environmentalists should take heart. A quiet revolution in industry's
use of electricity is taking place. CHP or combined heat and power systems,
which generate electricity and heat from a single source, are slowly
catching on.
These systems can be twice as efficient as conventional boilers and can cut
CO emissions by 70 per cent. If CHP capacity reaches 30,000MW by 2020, as
the government hopes, national CO emissions could fall by 15 per cent.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (1): New market pressures
 -In addition to the rigours of recession, the electricity industry is
having to meet new demands. Growing competition in the market and the
pressure to protect the environment mean that utilities are being forced to
reshape their strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOWLY but surely, competitive forces are beginning to prise open the
monopolistic and nationalistic world of electricity generation.
Utilities around the world are beginning to feel the cold winds of
commercial pressures. 'The old watchwords of 'obligation to serve' and
'build new capacity to meet future demand well in advance' are being
replaced by an industry built on contractual relations and commercial
orientation,' a recent report on the European industry concluded.*
Governments are cutting back their funding support for the industry and
large industrial customers are increasingly chafing at high electricity
prices. Meanwhile, recession is forcing the industry to pare back its
projections of future demand: in western Europe, annual growth over the next
few years is unlikely to reach the 3.2 per cent recorded in the second half
of the 1980s, let alone the 7.2 per cent of the golden years in the 1960s.
The European Commission is casting an increasingly jaundiced eye over the
gamut of arrangements which hinder free trade in electricity within the EC.
Last month, the Commission gave Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain two months to show that
they were not impeding the free flow of electricity across their national
boundaries. Failure to do so could result in legal action by Brussels.
'Competition and the freedom to import and export are essential components
of the policies needed to create an internal energy market,' argued Sir Leon
Brittan, European commissioner for competition. The moves are widely seen as
an opening shot in what is likely to prove a long battle with the utilities
to create 'open access' in electricity supply, thereby allowing large
business customers to shop around for cheaper power.
The UK industry has seen the greatest changes over the past year, as the
government's privatisation programme has come to fruition. The flotation of
the 12 regional electricity companies, together with National Power and
PowerGen, the conventional generators, completed the process in England and
Wales. They will shortly be joined in the private sector by Scottish Power
and Scottish Hydro-Electric, the two Scottish companies due to make their
stock market debut in June. That will leave only the industry in Northern
Ireland, which is scheduled for sale next year.
Radical though these privatisations are, perhaps even more innovative has
been the UK's attempt to create a new trading market in electricity known as
the pool. It is still too early to judge the success of this new market, the
heart of the government's attempt to inject competition into the industry.
Pessimists fear that the electricity regulator will find the new structure
inadequate for fostering full competition in the industry, just as his
counterparts in gas and telecommunications have found in their domains. Yet
the electricity companies have already begun to forge new strategies to meet
the demands of the private sector, notably by switching their power plant
ordering programme away from large coal stations towards gas.
The switch towards gas-fired generation has become a notable trend
throughout the industrialised world. Gas stations are quicker to build and
cheaper to operate than large coal or nuclear plants. Crucially, they also
have environmental benefits, emitting less sulphur dioxide (which causes
acid rain) and carbon dioxide (which causes global warming) for an
equivalent amount of energy as coal stations.
Indeed, green pressures are now the number one concern of many utilities, as
public awareness of the environment, the flow of eco-regulations and the
cost of cleaning up plant mount in almost equal measures. Nowhere is this
more true than in eastern Europe, where the newly democratic countries face
the twin task of reducing their dependence on inefficient coal-fired
stations and dealing with the aftermath of inadequate safety standards in
Soviet-designed nuclear plant.
Collaboration between the two formerly divided halves of Europe is likely to
mount. Czechoslovakia has already signed a technical accord with France,
whereby Europe's premier nuclear nation will help the Czechs to upgrade
their eight Soviet-designed reactors to EC standards. Germany has been
putting together a powerful consortium of west German utilities, leavened by
some non-German firms led by Electricite de France, to modernise east
Germany's industry. One estimate suggests that investment of DM30bn-DM50bn
(Pounds 10bn-Pounds 16.6bn) will be needed in east Germany's industry over
the next six years.
While prospects are good for gas-fired and combined heat and power plants,
the nuclear industry worldwide remains in the doldrums. Having braced itself
for a burst of bad publicity to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the industry has to cope with an even more
intractable problem: a continuing dearth of orders over the next decade.
Those countries, such as France where public acceptance of nuclear power
remains high, tend to have a surplus of capacity; whereas in others, notably
the US, there is no sign of the public distrust of the nuclear option
waning.

FT  25 APR 91 / Setback to insurance tax reduction policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRIVE in the US Congress to reduce taxes for the US old-age insurance
system yesterday suffered a jolting setback on a 60-38 vote in the Senate to
shelve the proposal.
Senator Daniel Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is the leading proponent
of the Social Security tax reduction, said the movement for lower social
security taxes had gained ground because the other side had admitted that
the tax funds were being used inappropriately.
However, support for the measure has apparently diminished since last year,
when 54 senators voted in its favour. Senator Moynihan will try again later
in the session but he will have to get the votes of 60 senators instead of a
simple majority.
The vote was a victory for President George Bush, who along with Republican
and most Democratic leaders, contended that a reduction in social security
taxes would jeopardise the entire system.
A majority of the Democrats supported Senator Moynihan, agreeing with his
contention that regressive social security tax is being used to mask the
size of the federal budget deficit.
They propose to make the system more progressive by increasing total
payments by wealthier citizens.

   NICOSIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR Israelis, two men and two women, arrested on suspicion of tampering
with a telephone junction box serving the Iranian embassy were remanded in
custody for eight days by a Nicosia court yesterday.
There were no formal charges but a police officer told the court they were
investigating conspiracy to commit a felony, possession of burglary tools by
night, fraudulent appropriation of power (meaning the electric current in a
telephone) and violation of a prohibitive order.
The two men, Debi Dave, 40 and Faf Souf 33, and the two women, Anna Dolgin
and Amit Litvin, both 28, looked quite relaxed as they were brought to court
in handcuffs.
Police said the four had arrived in Cyprus on Sunday and were due to leave
tomorrow, Friday. The two couples were staying in two luxury hotels in the
coastal town of Limassol.
The four Israelis were apprehended late on Tuesday night when police making
a routine security check on the building housing the Iranian Embassy (which
adjoins a central Nicosia police station) found them 'interfering' with the
telephone junction at the entrance to the building.
They allegedly had with them burglary tools that included a pair of pliers,
a tiny torch, a screwdriver, a battery-operated welding tool used for fixing
cables and several cables with connectors. They told police they were
'looking for a toilet'.
The four suspects appeared in court without a lawyer and one of them, Dave,
said they did not accept the facts presented by the police.
Legal sources say there is no specific law in Cyprus against telephone
tapping.
An Israeli embassy official met the four suspects before yesterday's
hearing.
The Iranian embassy in Nicosia, set up two years ago, is headed by a charge
d'affaires and has about 10 staff.
Iranian diplomats have said they plan to expand. But, unlike some foreign
missions on Cyrpus, the embassy is not a major Middle East listening post.
It occupies the top three floors of a five-storey office building next to a
police station on Santa Rosa Street.

FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: South Korean trade plans fail to impress
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA met a frosty reception from its fellow-Gatt members yesterday
when it launched a programme to liberalise trade in a further 133 products,
mostly agricultural, as part of a phased move to unwind curbs allowed to
developing countries with balance-of-payments problems.
Mr Lee Bong-suh, minister for agriculture, said that South Korea would give
more priority to expanding world commerce than to protecting its farmers in
revived global trade talks.
South Korea was blamed as one of the culprits when the multilateral Gatt
talks collapsed on the question of farm subsidies last December, but in
renewed talks 'you will notice that Korea's position . . . even in the
agriculture sector will have changed considerably,' Mr Lee said.
Mr Young Woo Park, Seoul's deputy ambassador to Gatt, said his government
faced opposition from farmers to the liberalisation.
The US joined other countries including Canada, the EC and New Zealand in
calling the offer disappointing.
Mr Lee said he intended to pledge cooperation toward a successful conclusion
of the Uruguay Round, in meetings with Ambassador Carla Hills, the US trade
representative.
Besides the Uruguay Round, they also discussed trade issues involving the
sale of US cigarettes, current negotiations involving South Korean
shipbuilding, and South Korea's recent austerity campaign, which has drawn
US accusations of import exclusion.
South Korea, which returned to current-account deficit last year for the
first time since the mid-1980s, has resisted attempts to open its farm
imports in the Round.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (17): Peking distrust of UK may hit Hong
Kong's prosperity - Political sniping accompanies countdown to 1997 handover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has turned the tables on Hong Kong since the Tiananmen Square crisis
in June 1989 when tens of thousands of local ethnic Chinese marched through
the streets in support of the Peking students' demands for democracy on the
mainland.
That support made China fear that the colony would develop into a centre for
subversion before the UK handed over sovereignty in 1997. Consequently,
Peking has become much more sensitive about developments in the colony and
about plans and policies drawn up by the British and Hong Kong governments,
which it distrusts.
It has launched outspoken and threatening criticisms of Hong Kong's
pro-democracy movement and it has also attacked three measures announced
late in 1989 to boost Hong Kong's confidence in the wake of the crushing of
the Tiananmen Square student movement - a Bill of Rights, the provision of
British passports for up to 225,000 people, and a massive HKDollars 127bn
(at 1988 prices) port and airport development scheme.
During the past 16 months, this approach has escalated into a crisis over
plans for the airport which is now costed at HKDollars 100bn in 1990 prices,
excluding port developments included in the original 1989 plans. In
particular, China has criticised the size and cost of the project and its
impact on Hong Kong's post-1997 financial reserves and debt.
But behind the detailed airport arguments, China has been establishing a
precedent to exert increasing influence over Hong Kong government decisions
in the run-up to 1997. It has won a say over the use of the government's
HKDollars 73bn financial reserves for funding the airport, and it has
demanded consultations leading to consensus on a wide range of other issues
connected with the project, which it would want to scrutinise.
This is causing considerable concern in Hong Kong because it has
demonstrated how easy it is for China to interfere in the colony's affairs
and slow down free-market developments before and after 1997. After initial
resistance, Hong Kong has accepted the need for consultation on issues such
as the airport which straddle 1997, but it has been reluctant to concede
demands for anything approaching consensus which could give Peking an
effective veto.
China and Britain agreed in 1984 that Hong Kong would enjoy a 'high degree
of autonomy' as a Special Administrative Region for 50 years after 1997
under a formula called 'one country two systems'. This was intended to leave
economic and political traditions intact.
There has always been concern that China would try to fudge this agreement
and interfere for a mixture of political and bureaucratic reasons after
(1997, and that this would probably slow down the growth and effectiveness
of Hong Kong's economy. But few people expected China to show its hand so
early.
China claims it has a right to a say because the 1984 Sino-British agreement
requires increased consultation in the second half of the 1984-97 transition
period, which is just beginning. It also says that it has a duty to the 6m
population to ensure that Britain leaves the colony and its economy in good
order.
Basically, China does not trust Britain, and senior officials suspect that
the UK will behave like other departing colonial powers and cream off the
riches before it goes. Similar suspicions are attached to the nearby
Portuguese enclave of Macao, which goes back to China in 1999, and which is
also running into problems with an airport project.
In the Hong Kong scenario, the UK is suspected of organising the airport so
that the colony's financial reserves could be drained to pay British
companies' for money-spinning construction contracts.
There is also a lack of understanding in China about capitalism and
wheeler-dealing traditions. Peking officials are concerned that Hong Kong
and Macao might be behaving like other Chinese provinces which launch
over-ambitious projects that cannot be completed prof itably and could then
land Peking with the debt.
Peking is widely acknowledged to be justified in its demands for
consultation and increasing involvement in Hong Kong's affairs as 1997
approaches. But the way it has pursued this target since the Tiananmen
Square crisis has seriously knocked confidence in Hong Kong's chances of
survival as a thriving international entrepot and financial centre after the
sovereignty handover.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (18): Things to do and avoid - Trading in
China is not for the light-hearted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CHINA is a difficult place to do business. It has a lot of idiosyncrasies
and doing business here takes a lot of time and effort. That is why to deal
in it successfully, it is often not a place for a small company.
However, to ignore China can be a serious mistake. For experienced business
people there is money to be made here.
What follows are some guidelines from veteran China traders and from
Peking-based diplomats about how to do business in this complex market.
Trips should be well planned. Visas are necessary. Business visas can be
obtained from any Chinese embassy, but travellers need a letter of
invitation from a Chinese host organisation. For those lacking a Chinese
sponsor, some embassies will help their nationals obtain one. Most, however,
will not get involved.
Yet a business visa is not always necessary. For those who are coming to
China for their first or second time, a tourist visa will suffice and is
readily obtainable in Hong Kong.
Travelling around the country used to be a nightmare for anyone with a fixed
schedule.
That has begun to change as the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC), China's national airline, has gradually computerised its operations.
It is now possible to buy round trip tickets to a handful of major cities in
China.
Interpreters are vital for those who cannot speak Chinese. The Chinese host
will always supply an interpreter, but it is better to bring their own to
any business meeting.
One way to find an interpreter is for the business traveller to ask at his
or her country's business trade council in Peking. For British citizens, the
China Britain Trade Group in Peking and Shanghai will help at minimal cost.
Newcomers to China should be aware of significant cultural differences in
the Chinese and Western ways of doing business. Patience, determination and
strong financial backing are essential, but equally important is recognition
of the fact that the Chinese concept of time differs dramatically from that
of the west.
Negotiations with the Chinese take time and time is only occasionally
important to the Chinese, a western diplomat says. First or even second time
business people should not expect to conclude a deal.
During the first visit, the businessman needs to obtain from the relevant
commercial sections of embassies or from the Ministry of Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade (MOFERT) some idea of the official policy towards his
product.
If the products are in a priority sector that is part of the government's
eighth Five-Year Plan, significant opportunities may be developed. However,
some products fall in a grey area or are actively discouraged by the
government and banned from being imported.
There are many ways of blocking imports. China has a complex system of
tariff and non-tariff controls to restrict foreign companies' access to its
domestic market.
Some of the barriers include:
import bans;
import licenses (which can be denied if domestic alternatives are available,
or if the goods are considered incompatible with China's goals);
a strict import substitution policy that restricts competition;
foreign exchange allocation;
testing and certification of foreign products to specifications not applied
to domestically-produced goods.
Once a businessman has decided to be in the China market, he should remember
a few basic rules:
never sign a loss leader. The Chinese are tough, organised negotiators who
know the real value of any product.
don't begin the first sale on the basis of losing money in order to gain
access.
know your end user's needs well. Rely on multiple channels for information
and never use only one source.
build a coalition of relationships with people involved in making the
decision.
For those serious about being in the China market, but who cannot afford to
staff it with their own representative, there are various alternatives.
China's telecommunication links with the rest of the world have improved
dramatically in the last decade, and calling or sending a fax is now simple.
But there is no substitute for a good agent in a country where personal
relationships are extremely important.
Agents provide contacts. Just as selecting an agent is important for those
exporting to China, choosing a partner in a joint venture operation is
perhaps the single most important decision a foreign company will make.
Finding a suitable partner takes time and knowing where to start can be a
daunting process, but much depends on the foreigner's line of business and
whether the goal is to export or manufacture.
Generally, big cities, the coastal provinces, and the south are favourite
areas of business for foreign trade.
'Anywhere but Peking, and the farther south you go the better,' a western
businessman says.
Other points to consider in selecting a partner include the organisation's
proximity to raw materials, electrical supply and shipping facilities.
Finally, don't let the system wear down your mental and professional
faculties, as happened to a French businessman who had been negotiating with
the Chinese over a problem for a year and a half.
When he believed he had finally resolved the matter and was preparing to
board his aircraft for home,the Chinese came to him at the airport, saying
another organisation had not agreed to the terms and problems remained.
This was too much. The Frenchman was subsequently found running naked around
Tiananmen square and was taken out of China in a straitjacket.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (14): Where the papers come three days late
 -Wuhan is China's natural crossroads, but is cut off by poor communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF WUHAN, the capital of Hubei province, is set to become one of China's
main communications hubs - as local officials claim, and a glimpse at any
map would endorse - how is it that Peking newspapers take three or four days
to arrive?
'We are the Chicago of the Orient,' Zhao Baojiang, the mayor of Wuhan,
claims in a grand hyperbolic sweep.
Wuhan is also at a critical midpoint on the Yangtze river, and sits abreast
China's main north-south railway, linking Hong Kong and Guangdong in the
south with Peking and the land-bridge to Europe in the north.
In a country with normal communications, Wuhan's pivotal location would
project it to the commercial and industrial centre-stage. Peking papers
would be available on the day of publication. But in China, it stands as a
monument to the awful impoverishment of the nation's communications.
The city's time may indeed come. But it will take considerable improvements
in the national transport infrastructure to transform its prospects. It will
also require the creation in China of a true national market. At present, a
labyrinth of bureaucratic obstacles to trade across provincial boundaries -
which amount to nothing less than provincial protectionism - make Wuhan's
central location in China a commercial irrelevance.
This perhaps explains why Hubei province has slipped in the past five years
from China's ninth most important exporter to its 13th.
It also explains why a province that is among the best endowed in China in
terms of agricultural and mineral resources, and in terms of industrial and
commercial capacity, has failed to make a more powerful mark among the
country's magnets for foreign investment.
Hubei's endowments are prolific: the Jianghan plain which straddles the
Yangtze in the heart of the province is among the most fertile in China. Its
red alluvial soils grow about one fifth of the country's cotton and makes
Hubei China's fifth largest grain producer.
Lakes spread across the south of the province - some of them more like
inland seas - provide a living for almost a quarter of a million fish
farmers, and underpin an industry in aquatic products that ranks third in
China.
These together make Hubei one of China's leading textile manufacturers and a
leader in food processing.
Rich supplies of iron, copper and an array of rarer minerals mainly in the
east of the province around Huangshi supply one of China's largest steel
complexes and a leading special steels manufacturer. These in turn underpin
the country's second largest automotive manufacturer, in Shiyan in Hubei's
north-west.
A combination of these resource-riches, and Hubei's pivotal location at the
heart of China, make it clear that few provinces would stand to gain so much
from the dismantling of centralised controls over China's economy, and the
loosening of the domestic market.
Local officials may not yet be fully aware of the riches liberalisation can
bring but in the meanwhile are committed to infrastructural improvements
over the decade ahead that will be of significant help when the virtues of
Hubei's prime location at the heart of China's market are allowed to come
into play.
A new RMB Yuan 600m international airport will be opening in 1993. A second
Yangtze road bridge joining Hankou and Wuchang will enhance north-south
communications in the province and ease traffic congestion in Wuhan itself.
Railway electrification is planned. A new 50,000-line telephone exchange is
being installed. Massive investment in both thermal and hydro power stations
is being made.
Economic zones are being established in Wuhan and in Yichang and Huangshi
along the banks of the Yangtze. They are intended to capitalise on the
creation of Shanghai's Pudong special economic zone over the coming decade.
This development underlies one of the most exciting changes now underway:
the re-establishment of the Yangtze, after half a century of neglect, as a
critically important commercial artery in central China.
A new foreign trade port is under construction, a companion to Baihushan
completed just east of Wuhan six years ago. New local shippers like Datong
and Qingchuan are vying with former state monopolies and the fast-growing
private shipper, Minsheng, to provide competitive services along the length
of the Yangtze for the first time since 1949.
While Hubei has until recently had only modest success in attracting foreign
investment, lagging in particular behind coastal provinces, recent deals
provide encouraging signs. A joint venture with Citroen, agreed last year,
will lead to the production of 300,000 cars a year in Wuhan and Shiyan,
further enhancing the province's importance as a supplier to the national
automobile market.
An optical fibre plant, to be built with help from Philips, will also be
important in enhancing China's domestic telecommunications capacity.
Foreign capital used for new equipment at the Wuhan Iron and Steel works is
intended to boost annual output from 5m tonnes of rolled steel to 7m tonnes
by the year 2000, boosting the company's role as one of China's four main
suppliers of high-quality steel.
If approval is given to the environmentally controversial Sanxia
hydroelectric project, which would be built across the Yangtze in the Three
Gorges on Hubei's western border with Sichuan, Hubei would become a critical
supplier of power to all of central China. The 13,000MW generated by Sanxia
would dwarf the recently-completed Gezhouba dam in Yichang, which generates
2,700MW and is already a critically important supplier to the Yangtze
region.
All these developments point to Wuhan's preparedness for the larger role
which would result from the creation of a nationwide market economy.
Local leaders pay lip service to the need for less central control of the
economy and more market freedoms.
But behind the brave rhetoric, the provincial authorities are not yet
willing to end subsidies to bankrupt factories.
In Wuhan, the leadership appears to have taken the first significant steps
towards unleashing market forces, and lifting the burden of company
subsidies from the shoulders of the government. Mayor Zhao Baojiang, who
estimates that one in 10 Wuhan workers is employed in a loss-making factory,
says: 'We are asking workers to move into the individual enterprise sector
if their factory is a 'losing money factory'.'
Chinese historians say that Wuhan has often been fortunate - but only in
unfortunate times.
With the ground now being well laid, a significant opening up of China's
economy to market forces could bring fortune in fortunate times. Yet Wuhan
would still have a long haul to become Mayor Zhao's 'Chicago of the Orient'.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (15): Natural magnet for Taiwan - John
Elliott visits Xiamen, a buoyant city with its face to the sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE old foreign trade and fishing port of Amoy in the south eastern province
of Fujian could develop during the next decade into one of China's most
important coastal industrial cities. Now called Xiamen, it is a special
economic zone and has become a focal point for investment from Taiwan, 156
nautical miles away across the South China Sea.
More than 400 Taiwanese companies have received approval during the past
three years to set up light industrial labour intensive factories involving
investment of more than Dollars 1bn. Goods ranging from Prince and Slazenger
tennis racquets and Phillips coffee pots to folding umbrellas, electronic
gadgets and textiles are being turned out in about 100 factories which have
started production.
Fujian and Taiwan have had close links for centuries. More than 70 per cent
of Taiwan's total 20m population originate from southern Fujian and the
dialects are similar. So the area is a natural choice for Taiwan's
businessmen who want to tap China's cheap labour and land, thus escaping
from Taiwan's escalating costs and restrictive environmental controls.
But the investment take-up has been slow, partly because Taiwan only allows
its businessmen to deal indirectly with China. This adds to costs because it
involves transporting goods through Hong Kong and channelling money through
New York and other financial centres.
The local economic growth rate has been between 16 and 17 per cent annually
for the past two years, according to officials, with industry growing by 20
per cent - despite China's economic and political problems. Targets for the
next five years have been set at the same levels.
This reflects the sudden entry of the Taiwanese, but the breakthrough that
Xiamen is waiting for is an investment decision from Taiwan on a Dollars 7bn
petrochemical plant which would dramatically change the city's fortunes. It
would provide a primary industrial base and would make Taiwanese involvement
take off with extensive down-stream industries.
The decision rests with the Taiwan government and with the industrialist
involved, Mr Wang Yung-ching, head of Formosa Plastics which is one of
Taiwan's largest companies. Mr Wang, whose family comes from the area, is in
negotiations with Peking and Taipei and has also talked about developing
ventures in banking, shipping and transport.
Taiwan, which regards itself as the rightful government of all China, is
softening its policies but seems unlikely to permit full and direct
investment, transport and communications for a year or so. It wants to use
Mr Wang's and other possible investments as a lever to persuade China to
provide some sort of overall investment protection agreement and to reduce
problems of bureaucratic corruption and scarcity of raw materials.
Meanwhile, Mr Wang is in negotiations on the extent and ownership of the
petrochemical plant, and Xiamen's government has started preparatory ground
works on the site, financed according to some reports by Mr Wang.
The centre of Xiamen, which consists of a series of islands adjacent to the
mainland with a population of 1.12m, was made a special economic zone in
1980. But it failed to develop significantly until Taiwan started to allow
the indirect industrial investment in 1987-88.
According to local government figures, a total of 980 projects, initially
mostly from Hong Kong and Macao, have been approved since 1980 for projects
costing Dollars 2.92bn. They include Dollars 2.12bn foreign investment, and
Taiwan accounts for 410 projects worth Dollars 1.07bn.
But only Dollars 500m foreign investment has actually gone ahead and this
includes Dollars 200m on a single project - a Taiwanese chemical fibre
plant.
An unusually high proportion of the projects are wholly foreign owned - 309
out of the 410 - indicating that the Taiwanese want to control the
businesses and do not want to delay investments while joint ventures are
negotiated. Most of the production is for export, supplementing the factory
owners' operations in Taiwan which often continue producing high-quality
ranges.
Factory managers say that labour costs are 75 to 90 per cent lower than in
Taiwan but that there is only an overall production cost saving of around 10
per cent after transport, lower levels of productivity, and other problems
are taken into account.
Keen Find Sporting Goods, for example, employs 400 people to turn out 2,000
tennis racquets a day using frames imported from Taiwan via Hong Kong -
international trade rules ban the import of the raw material into China.
Mr Golden Ehang, th general manager, says wages are 12 per cent of Taiwan's,
but he makes only 8 per cent on overall costs. 'I have come here only
because the costings will improve when Taiwan's rules are eased - it's not
worth it otherwise.'
One of Xiamen's strengths is that there are 350,000 overseas Chinese for
whom the city is an ancestral home. They include members of such famous
families as Mr Lee Quan Yew of Singapore and Mrs Cory Acquino of the
Philippines.
It has ambitions as a tourist destination, primarily based on the
attractions of a small island adjacent to the city centre called Gulang yu
which is full of colonial villas built for foreign consulates and companies
100 years ago.
To help attract investment, urgently needed infrastructure projects are now
being planned. They include a Yuan 1.5bn 600 megawatt power station which is
to be partly funded by Hong Kong Macao International Investment, a
part-China owned Hong Kong company.
Other projects include: a Yuan 340m water supply plant, supported with loans
from Japan that will cover 35 per cent of the cost; a Yuan 350m harbour
development financed domestically; a Yuan 320m airport extension which is
now seeking fresh finance after losing loans of at least Yuan 100m from
Kuwait; and a Yuan 350m telecommunications expansion which has yet to be
financed.
The real breakthrough, however, will only come when, eventually, Taiwan
permits direct investment, air flights and other links with China.
In the meantime, Taiwan adopts a confrontational diplomatic offensive
against China.
The real breakthrough will come only when Taiwan permits direct investment,
flights and other links

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (16): Revival of a 70 year-old dream - Plan
to dam the mighty Yangtse stirs environmental fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLINA MACDOUGALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the most beautiful and romantic stretches of water in the world is
the Yangtse river where it flows through three massive gorges below
Chongqing, in the south-west province of Sichuan.
The misty cliffs which overhang it have figured in many a famous Chinese
painting and the trees and wild life up the side valleys are increasingly
precious in a country near-devastated by industrial pollution.
The Yangtse, or Changjiang, as the Chinese call it, is the third longest
river in the world with a mean annual runoff of 9.8bn cubic metres. Flooding
is a perennial threat to the tens of millions who live downstream, and in a
country short of energy its waters are keenly viewed as a source of
hydropower.
In 1923, Sun Yat Sen, China's first president, proposed a huge dam across
the lowest gorge to control the floods. Since then the project has been
endlessly debated and researched by politicians, engineers and
hydro-electric specialists. The scheme surfaced again last year, though
subject to further approval by the rubber-stamp National People's Congress.
Now Han Hongshu, vice-governor of Hubei province, speaks as if work is about
to begin. Hubei has already done well out of the Gezhouba dam at Yichang,
downstream of the gorges, which created new jobs and now provides power. In
Sichuan, they are not so sure: 'Of course the central government must
decide, but we here think it would be better to spend the money on dams and
hydropower projects upstream on the Yangtse tributaries", says Ma Lin, the
Vice-governor.
Advocates of the dam point to the reduction in flood risks, the 18bn units
of electricity a year that the scheme would generate and the improved
navigability of the river, enabling ocean-going ships to reach Chongqing.
The Ministry of Water Resources and Power set up a committee of 412 experts,
of whom more than 400 supported it, while a detailed Canadian feasibility
study also found in favour.
Opponents stress the enormous cost (yuan 36 bn), the number of people to be
resettled (a million or so), the risk of earthquake or (in the event of a
war) bomb damage and unpredictable environmental consequences. They also
point to illogicalities in the concept: for power generation the reservoir
upstream must be full, for flood retention empty.
In 1989, the year of the Tiananmen demonstrations, the dam became a
political issue. A group of writers led by Dai Qing, later put under house
arrest as a dissident, published a book opposing it as a 'Stalinist folly'.
They accused Li Peng, the premier, a Moscow-trained electrical engineer (and
a one-time head of the ministry in charge of hydro-power) of trying to
bolster his own prestige by linking his name with a project once favoured by
Chairman Mao.
These intellectuals are silenced now, but the questions remain. Where will
the resettled population go? ('Further up the mountains' said Ministry of
Water Resources officials). Could silting gradually fill the 500 km
reservoir behind the dam, leaving Chongqing literally high and dry?
Wouldn't it be better for Peking to spend the money on installing equipment
nationwide to save electricity rather than providing more?
One look at China shows how little care is given to the environment. The
builders of the Gezhouba dam seem not to have known of the existence of the
Yangtse sturgeon (now proudly displayed at the Yichang breeding station )
until they bumped their noses on the new barrier going upstream to spawn.
It seems unlikely enough research has been done on river and marine life,
climatic consequences, loss of land fertility or the greater scouring
effects caused by a less silt-burdened river.
While China seems unlikely on grounds of cost to build the dam in the near
future, it remains a threat as long as a totalitarian government in Peking
can in the last resort overrule opposition.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (10): Central planners who cannot let go -
State industries losses spiral out of control / David Dodwell examines the
parlous state of Chinese industry and its continuing decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S state industry is in a parlous condition. Everyone from premier Li
Peng, through finance minister Wang Bingqian to the State Statistical Bureau
is in agreement on this.
But the narrow gap between listing industry's failings to formulating
solutions seems to be unbreachable since the leap involves espousing market
forces and dismantling control over giant industrial machines that have for
decades been the focus of political power and patronage.
According to the State Statistical Bureau (SSB), more than one third of
China's state enterprises - which employ 50m of the country's 150m urban
workers - are making losses. Wang Bingqian, finance minister, noted in the
recent National People's Congress that the government spent the equivalent
of Dollars 11bn in 1990 subsidising state factories, with another Dollars
7.3bn spent on price subsidies for workers.
Noting that more than one third of the government's budget is now consumed
by subsidy payments, Wang admitted that enterprise losses 'have already
reached the point where the state treasury cannot sustain them.' Urgent
needs to improve housing, medical care and the country's rudimentary welfare
system - not to mention modernising industry - are being preempted by the
political imperative of keeping state factories on life support machines.
While the gross value of industrial output (GVIO) rose 7.6 per cent in 1990,
the impetus for growth came from light industry (+9.1 per cent), private
industry (+21.6 per cent) and joint ventures (+56 per cent). State industry
lifted output by 2.9 per cent, according to the SSB.
Even these figures mislead, since much of the rise in output was fuelled in
the middle of 1990 by a bank lending spree that was intended to lift output
to the level that would allow the central government to argue that state
plan targets for the five year plan ending last December had been met. Much
of this additional output went straight on to stockpiles - which increased
by RMB 30bn in 1990, according to the SSB.
While state enterprise losses doubled from 1989 to RMB 28bn, profits fell 58
per cent, and government tax receipts from state industry fell 18.5 per cent
between 1989 and 1990 to RMB 127bn, the SSB said. Over the five year period
from 1985-1990 the economic return on every RMB 100 of working capital fell
from RMB 23.8 to RMB 16.8, while profits fell from an average of 11.8 per
cent to 6.3 per cent.
The present leadership talks of the need for reform, but appears unable to
accept the loss of central control that would follow. Leaders are also
traumatised by a fear that the upheavals inevitably associated with
root-and-branch reform would foment political rebellion.
Small steps have been taken: the price of basic inputs such as coal, steel
and electricity is being raised closer to real market prices. A rudimentary
and confused tax system has begun to give companies more independence to
invest profits as they think best. A free market in most goods is beginning
to grow up as companies are allowed to sell for themselves goods produced
above plan commitments.
Collective and private enterprises have also come to play a bigger part in
the economy, particularly in the coastal provinces and southern China,
reducing the political clout of state enterprises, as well as their dominant
impact on the national economy. However, there is cold comfort in this
growth, since many of these collective enterprises have little intrinsic
economic value, thriving mainly because of the monstrous inefficiency of the
state industrial machine.
The World Bank, in a recent analysis of China's economy*, praises the
government's success in progressively increasing production of industrial
raw materials such as oil, coal and steel, but then argues that none of this
massive investment in raising output would have been needed if industry used
these materials more efficiently.
It points to 'high energy and steel dependency' that is a result of being
sheltered from external competition, being technologically backward, using
obsolete capacity, and achieving very low productivof factories producing
one-thirtieth of the output possible using more efficient technologies.
Staff at Wuhan Iron &amp; Steel, one of the country's leading high-quality steel
makers, endorse this view. They say only 25 per cent of China's 66m
tonnes-per-year steel output is usable in modern industry.
'Heavy industry absorbs far too much capital,' the World Bank says: 'It
provides below average returns, and its appetite for energy is one of the
root causes of chronic shortages.
'By targetting machinery and metal industries for promotion, China will
starve more deserving sectors of capital, perpetuate an artificial shortage
of investment funds in a situation of resource availability few countries
can rival, and limit its growth potential.
'The quantum of investment alone is not enough.'
Rather than spend more on power generation, the government should spend on
replacing old and power hungry machinery, the Bank says: rather than pay
subsidies for factories to produce for stockpiles, government should spend
on redeploying workers in new and more efficient factories.
Enterprise reform is at the heart of this debate. For western economists,
this means plant closures on a significant scale, and willingness to allow
market forces to sort the survivors. Peking's central planners have
preferred to investigate 'enterprise groups', where profitable companies
absorb chronic loss-makers with the aim of turning them round.
For example, Shanghai Vacuum, the largest of the seven companies publicly
quoted on the infant Shanghai stock exchange, was forced by the municipality
to take on 2,400 workers from failed local enterprises in 1989. This added
RMB 7m to its annual payroll, and did nothing for profits.
Yanzheng Industrial, a smaller quoted stock on the Shanghai exchange, had
just 100 staff until the local Jing An district government forced it to
assume responsibility for 100 workers from a failed factory nearby. Because
there is no work for these people, they have to stay at home on full pay at
Yanzheng's expense. A further 200 retired workers from the failed factory
were put on Yanzheng's pension scheme.
Chinese companies complain this practice is like 'whipping the fast ox'.
In place of practical proposals aimed at resolving the crisis at the heart
of China's industry, leaders in Peking have invoked the slogan of 'Quality,
Variety and Efficiency' in 1991. The slogan's principal virtue is that it
inflicts no damage on the icon of Marxist central planning. The longer
leaders indulge in slogans rather than face head-on the problems of China's
industry, the more painful the solutions are likely to be.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (11): Old tune is heard again - Stock
market's quiet return in an old hotel ballroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANGHAI'S old and distinguished Astor Hotel, located at the end of the
riverside Bund which housed the city's former financial centre, has a new
lease of life, writes John Elliott.
With a nice touch of irony which officials insist is accidental, half of its
premises (now renamed the Pujiang Hotel) have been converted to house
Shanghai's fledgling stock exchange which was formally opened with much
fanfare last December.
A grand and renovated wood-panelled entrance hall leads to the old Astor
ballroom where the tunes of foxtrots and waltzes have been replaced by the
silence of numbers flickering on a large prices screen and about 25 or so
computer terminals, surrounded by red-jacketed jobbers.
Poorly dressed men and women queue on the pavement outside to place their
savings, while others less well off peer uncertainly through the front door
at this rather unlikely re-emergence of capitalism in Communist China.
But this does not mark an imminent conversion of China's centrally planned
and provincially controlled economy into a share-owning society  - and it
may well be years before one can safely forecast whether this very cautious
and hesitant experiment will have any significant impact on the country's
economy.
In a small way, however, it is a significant development - along with a more
unruly stock market in the southern special economic zone of Shenzhen,
adjacent to Hong Kong, and a nation-wide treasury bond trading system,
called Securities Automated Quotations System (STAQ) which was launched in
Peking last December, linking six cities and 18 licensed trading
corporations. Guangzhou, capital of the southern province of Guangdong, is
also considering a stock exchange.
The significance is that there are sufficient economic reformers in Peking
and elsewhere to push the experiments through, despite the ideological
opposition of officials who fear both the economic and social implications,
and despite the country's political uncertainty which deters bureaucratic
initiative.
The central government wants to try to ease its acute cash shortage by
encouraging secondary markets for about yuan 114bn bonds already in
circulation, and by tapping an estimated total of yuan 700bn-1,000bn
personal savings.
In Shanghai, there were extra reasons last December for formalising local
bond and share trading which had been taking place since the mid-1980s
across banking counters and on kerb-sides in seven or eight company stocks
and 25 bonds issued by the government, financial institutions and companies.
Peking wants to recreate Shanghai as China's financial capital and it also
wants to attract funds for an ambitious Dollars 10bn industrial and
commercial development planned in an area of Shanghai called Pudong.
'The securities market is a long term aim to develop a financial market
which will help to finance Pudong and will introduce market mechanisms into
resource allocation and company management,' says Mr He Gaosheng, director
of the Office of Shanghai Economic System Reform.
'But public ownership will remain the mainstay, and the share system will
not become very important - it is only on trial at present and that will
last for perhaps five or ten years or more.'
At least some claim of the quoted companies say they have new managerial
freedom, even though the government is still effectively in control.
'We have more autonomy in our management and less direct intervention by the
government so we make quicker decisions on investment and other issues,'
says Mr Liang Zhengsheng, vice general manager of Shanghai Vacuum Electron
Device, an amalgamation of six factories producing television tubes and
other electrical goods which in 1987 became the first government-owned
enterprise to have shareholders.
Shanghai's Developments were held up by China's economic rectification
policy of the past two years, but the potential has been demonstrated since
December.
Trading, which is dominated by the bond market, has rocketed from an average
of yuan 6m a day in December to yuan 42m a day last month. Mr Wei Wenyuan,
general manager of the exchange, forecasts that it could reach yuan 6bn this
year, up from yuan 2.4bn last year and yuan 800m in 1989. An estimated 1m
people out of Shanghai's 13m population are believed to have participated in
securities transactions.
Institutions such as insurance companies, labour unions and workers
retirement funds are estimated to account for about 40 per cent of the
trading, and the rest is by individuals.
There are various forecasts about how fast the market will grow. The bond
business might double in a year or so but the speed of the introduction of
new companies is less clear.
Plans are being drawn up - but could take some time to come into force  - to
allow foreign investors to buy a special designation of B shares in certain
companies and at least one foreign joint venture has applied to be quoted.
In Shenzhen, where trading began in 1987, transactions last year totalled
yuan 1.77bn, mainly in equities. There are only five listed companies and
there was such rampant speculation last year, much on a kerb-side black
market and involving local officials, that government restrictions were
imposed and formal approval for the opening of a new stock exchange
headquarters and trading floor was delayed.
Such problems underline why there is deep suspicion and concern about
allowing any rapid expansion.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (12): Determined to go its own way - Colina
MacDougall takes the pulse of Sichuan province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLINA MACDOUGALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SICHUAN is the poorest province in China', says bouncy and fast-talking Ma
Lin, the vice-governor in charge of the economy. 'We're worse off even than
Tibet - our yearly per capita income is only yuan 104. Tibet gets yuan 1bn a
year in aid from Peking, and we're given nothing, although our population of
minorities is twice that of Tibet's'
His solution is more reform. Sichuan was famous as the launching pad for the
successful rural reforms of the late 1970s, under its then leader, the
now-disgraced former party boss, Zhao Ziyang. Vice-governor Ma, who hails
from one of China's richest east-coast provinces, Jiangsu, wants a greater
'opening to the outside world' - more foreign trade and investment.
Exports are already doing well. Mainly agriculture-based, they rose from
around Dollars 300m in 1985 to Dollars 1.1bn in 1990.
Foreign investment has made a start, despite Sichuan's inadequate rail links
and limited use of its main east-west artery, the Yangtse.
The provincial government still has the wrong idea about foreign investors.
'Pepsi is eager to set up a factory in Sichuan as the population is huge and
it's the centre of south-western China', said Mr Wang Chongming,
vice-director of the province's commission of foreign economic relations and
trade.
'We've offered them a package - if they want to come, they must renovate a
steel plant and build us a TV tower with a revolving restaurant'. Conditions
like these seem unlikely to tempt westerners. Most of Sichaun's existing
joint ventures are with Hong Kong companies who can usually make a
profitable deal. A dozen or so apiece are with the US and Taiwan, and a
handful with Japan. On the agenda for the future is a zinc plant, currently
under discussion with Australia's BHP.
Despite the poverty, emphasised by vice-governor Ma, to the casual foreign
eye Sichuan seems prosperous. Markets in Chengdu, the provincial capital,
are overflowing with food, flowers, pet song-birds, fluffy jumpers and
hi-fis. Guanghan county, 35 kms away and the site of a new reform
experiment, is bursting with smart-looking busy shoppers.
On the other hand, Chongqing (wartime capital of Chiang Kaishek and now, at
a population of 14m, China's largest city) and the neighbouring towns along
the Yangtse are dilapidated and filthy. Sichuan has been officially ranked
as fourth poorest province and may have slipped further.
It has serious problems such as a huge population (now 107m) and limited
arable land. Half its area is mountainous, inhabited by only 6m or 7m,
mainly ethnic non-Chinese, and the remaining 101m, 80 per cent of whom live
off the land, are crammed into the rest.
'Our farmers are getting poorer', says Ma. 'We must get on with reform.'
Commented one westerner with business connections in Chengdu, 'Sichuan is
determined to go its own way, though unlike Guangdong (where powerful
Governor Ye Xuanping has ignored central government directives to cut back
on reform) it hasn't openly defied Peking.'
Officials are discreet, but hint at their differences with the centre. For
instance, they were critical of the reflation applied to the economy last
year after a massive slowdown resulting from a loan freeze. 'The new credit
came too late and it didn't solve the problem', said an economist with the
provincial economic commission.
As in the rest of China, Sichuan's industry suffered in 1990. Adding to the
burden are the hundreds of old heavy industry factories moved there under
Mao Zedong's dispersal strategy of the 1960s. These are many miles from raw
materials sources and markets and lose money at the best of times.
The farming population has also been hit this year, ironically by the
excellent harvest. In 1990, Sichuan produced an all-time high of 42.5m
tonnes of grain compared with 40.8m tonnes in 1989, but in the free-market
prices fell and the state commercial departments would not buy more than
agreed quotas. This means financial loss for farmers who had already bought
diesel and fertiliser.
But this plenty has given the provincial government the opportunity to
experiment with freeing grain prices, currently subsidised at huge cost to
the central government. In Guanghan County, 35 kms from Chengdu with a
population of half a million, from April 1 this year all grain was to be
sold at market prices. This meant an end to farm quotas and ration tickets.
Guanghan's wage-earners will receive a subsidy to make this more palatable:
it means a price-rise to around 50 fen (Chinese cents), from around 13 fen
per half-kilo. Little protest is expected - in Guanghan city in mid-March
shoppers at the grain store were unconcerned.
'We'll get an idea straight away of whether it induces farmers to plant more
grain or less', said Mr Zhou Jiapei, director of Guanghan's Economic
Restructuring Office. 'Then in a few months we can see what the urban
customers think.' This experiment might then be applied in other parts of
the country.
Sichuan's reform principles are reflected in one of China's most successful
private businesses. The Minsheng Shipping Co. in Chongqing, which ran
Yangtse and mainly coastal shipping before the communist victory in 1949,
re-emerged after 1978 to resume its business. Now managed by 68-year-old Lu
Guoji, son of the founder, this family business jumped from a turnover of
Dollars 1.2m in 1985 to Dollars 40m in 1989.
The registered capital is yuan 50m, of which employees hold yuan 2m. and the
rest is in family hands. Mr Lu has put his son in charge of the Hong Kong
office and a cousin (a former researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences)
into one of his light-industrial joint ventures.
Now handling about 50 containers a month, he plans to build his own
container wharf and raise the number to 3,000 a month. HIs other businesses
are multiplying. He is making piles of money where the three other
(state-run) shipping companies in Chongqing are losing it. It is a pity
Sichuan is not free to apply Mr Lu's private enterprise principles in other
areas.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (13): Front line for reformers - Shanghai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW and bleak 30-storey hotel extension to the old Jingjiang Hotel in
China's former commercial capital of Shanghai is said to epitomise a flashy
version of the country's four economic modernisations - it has a steel
structure, a multi-storey design, a revolving restaurant, and lifts going up
the outside of the building.
As China struggles forward with its economic reforms, Shanghai also has two
other fashionable modernisations - a proposed yuan 12bn special economic
development zone called Pudong, and a new stock exchange.
Whether any of them will succeed is open to question. The Jingjiang's
revolving restaurant, like those in many of Shanghai's half empty hotels,
has scarcely any customers and it jerks between revolving too quickly and
not moving at all. External lifts in China tend to break down. The fledgling
stock exchange has taken off in a small way since it was officially launched
last December, trading on the Chinese love of gambling, but little has
happened yet in Pudong.
Nevertheless Shanghai, with its population of more than 12m, is the place to
watch in the next few years because it has been picked out for special
treatment by Peking. The idea is to use the Pudong plan as a catalyst to
restore the city to its old position as the financial and business heart of
China, and to start a new modernisation drive inland up the Yangtse River.
This is backed both by economic reformers, who want to breathe new life into
the 1980s opening-up policies, and by older conservatives who support
Shanghai's emerging mixture of limited free enterprise in a planned economy.
It therefore provides an alternative focus to the highly prosperous
free-wheeling southern province of Guangdong, of which Peking
traditionalists disapprove - and it might in the distant future even
challenge Hong Kong.
It has been led since April 1988 by Mr Zhu Rongji, a charismatic and
strong-minded 62-year old mayor, who was promoted early this month to Peking
to be one of China's five vice premiers. He is a reformist and is expected
to continue to be involved in the development of Shanghai, especially
Pudong, but will probably be succeeded as mayor by Mr Huang Ju, a vice mayor
who has been in charge of financial policy including foreign investment.
His support in Peking is assumed to be based on firm backing from Mr Deng
Xiaoping, China's veteran leader, supported by Mr Jiang Zemin, the Communist
Party general secretary who used to be in Shanghai.
This has helped him to: shake up the bureaucracy (making marginal inroads
into entrenched inertia); begin to tackle creaking infrastructural problems
with major projects; encourage foreign loans and investment; pave the way
for six new foreign banks; improve the lot of foreign joint ventures; open
the stock exchange; and launch Pudong as a symbol of a new future.
The main reform now being finalised is for housing. The aim is to tap
private savings and create more funds for housebuilding, improve
maintenance, and encourage expansion of private housing which now accounts
for 20 per cent of the total. People renting or buying accommodation will
have to contribute to a central provident fund which they can then draw on
later, and rents are being raised.
But, despite all this, Mr Zhu has only scratched at the surface of an old
industrial city which almost defies modernisation. Economic performance is
hit by antiquated over-manned factories, and Peking drains the city of much
of its surplus funds.
While GNP grew by 3.1 per cent last year (down from 5.3 per cent in 1989),
according to government figures, the output from state sector enterprises
declined by 0.6 per cent. It was pulled down by municipally owned factories
which dropped 1.6 per cent, while those controlled and favoured by Peking
grew by 9 per cent.
Mr Zhu has not managed to in push through a policy of closing old
loss-making factories - there are some 10,000 old run-down enterprises -
though a little progress has been made by merging manufacturers of similar
products into about 30-40 enterprise groups.
But he has begun to change the climate for foreign joint ventures and two of
the country's most successful (rated by a government newspaper) are in
Shanghai producing Volkswagen cars and Pilkington glass. Foreign managers
say that, despite all the problems, Shanghai has definite benefits,
including an industrial base for component manufacture.
For nearly 40 years after the Communists came to power, Shanghai was used by
Peking as a cash cow for Peking's coffers. This was arrested three years ago
and a new 50-50 formula for sharing payments with the capital was
introduced. But Peking has continued to make extra demands and a total of
around yuan 13bn has been handed over in each of the past two years, leaving
only about 25 per cent of yuan 16-17bn total revenues for local spending.
This is however partly offset by Peking aid for Pudong which, in every way,
is Shanghai's main hope for the future.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (7): US Congress holds the key - David
Dodwell on China's need to guard its trade and investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MENTION MFN to Peking's trade officials and you get a beneficent smile and a
glib 'No problem'. Mention MFN in Hong Kong or Guangdong, and you see sweat
on the temples.
By June 3, President Bush must agree to renew for another year the Most
Favoured Nation status that assures China low-tariff exports to the US.
Signs are that in spite of deep reservations, President Bush will agree. But
within the following 60 days, it is likely that the US Congress will summon
the two thirds majority it needs to veto the renewal. All will then hang on
a Senate vote.
In spite of complacency in Peking, the consequences of losing MFN status
would be grave for China.
Exports to the US would fall by at least 50 per cent, according to the
American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. Guangdong province, with most at
stake, would lose about Dollars 2bn in exports, with over 1m workers losing
their jobs. Guangdong's GDP would slump by 10 per cent.
Describing the 'deadly impact' of losing MFN privileges, Mr John Kamm, then
President of Hong Kong's American Chamber of Commerce, told Congressional
hearings last year: 'The open coastal provinces and cities - the China of
reform - will be hard hit. Their leaders - supporters of the deposed party
secretary Zhao Ziyang - severely undermined by rapid falls in living
standards which owe much to export earnings.'
This evidence, which played an important part last year in persuading US
congressional critics of China to renew MFN status, is about to be replayed
in Washington. If anything, the mood is even more grim. Regrets in the wake
of the Gulf war over the price paid for supporting Saddam Hussein over past
decades have prompted US leaders to toughen their stance against regimes
they regard as tyrannical.
Protectionist sentiment in the US has also hardened. China admits a trade
surplus with the US, even though it does not acknowledge that a large
proportion of China's re-exports through Hong Kong are in fact exports to
the US.
An array of administrative measures in China to trim imports have also
aroused Washington's anger. They were introduced to tackle rampant inflation
inside China, as well as to shore up foreign exchange reserves ahead of a
debt-repayment peak in 1992-93.
The result has been to give China its first visible trade surplus since
1984. Exports rose 18.1 per cent in 1990 to Dollars 62bn, while imports fell
9.8 per cent to Dollars 53bn. A surplus on invisibles boosted the current
account surplus to Dollars 13.1bn.
While textile exports have struggled against competition particularly from
Pakistan, and petroleum exports have slipped because of mounting domestic
demand, China is expected to retain a strong competitive advantage in coming
years in the export of consumer electronics - including TVs, radios,
microwaves and computers - and in pharmaceuticals and machine tools.
Tourism has also begun to recover after Tiananmen. After a 23 per cent slump
between 1988 and 1989, more than 27m tourists visited China last year, a 12
per cent improvement on the year. Tourism revenues have recovered to the
1988 level of Dollars 2.2bn after a 20 per cent fall in 1989.
Perhaps to the alarm of Peking's more conservative economic planners,
international trade has risen in importance to assume a considerable
significance in the domestic economy.
Foreign investment flows have played a parallel role to trade. Peking says
foreign investment amounted to a record Dollars 6.57bn in 1990, a leap of
17.3 per cent from 1989. Since both Japan and the US say their investment
was down, the impetus came largely from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Even more encouraging from Peking's point of view is that hotel and property
deals - which accounted for a large share of investment through the 1980s -
have slumped. According to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and
Trade, about 90 per cent of investment last year was in manufacturing,
regarded as being of much greater intrinsic benefit to the economy.
In a bid to attract more high technology investment, China has set up 27 new
high-tech zones across the country, lifting the total to 38. Foreign
investors in the zones will pay just 15 per cent income tax - compared with
the standard rate of 33 per cent. If they export 70 per cent of their
output, tax falls still further to 10 per cent. The government's aim is to
boost high-tech output value from the current level of RMB7bn to RMB25bn by
1996.
Prospective investors nevertheless continue to complain that doing business
in China remains testing. Many fail to anticipate how many years it can take
to conclude a deal.
Equally commonly, 'cheap' labour can become expensive when undisclosed
bonuses and subsidies are added. A lack of control over land-use fees,
energy costs, or provisions for infrastructure can also provide nightmares
for financial controllers back at company headquarters.
These and more general factors point towards a bleaker investment climate in
the early part of the 1990s: the higher priorities of reconstruction in the
Gulf, forging links in eastern Europe, or simply battening down against
domestic recession, mean that many traditional western investors will not be
running hotfoot to China.
However, strong and ongoing investor interest from Hong Kong and Taiwan in
China's south, and perhaps from Japan and South Korea in the north, may help
to insulate the country from an otherwise more difficult foreign investment
climate.
Either way, whether Peking's conservative leaders like it or not, China's
doors to the outside world have been firmly opened. The importance of trade
and investment to the national economy is now so great that the price of
closing the doors is probably too high to contemplate. This in the longer
term has to provide reformers with confidence that economic trends will
eventually play into their hands.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (8): Pudong - gamble for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW word has appeared on the lips of almost every Chinese official
discussing the country's hopes for the future - Pudong, writes John Elliott.
It is the name of a 350 sq km area of Shanghai, China's second city, which
is to be developed over the next 20-30 years with a series of special
industrial and trade zones.
But Pudong - or Pudong New Area as it is called - is not just for Shanghai.
Backed by the country's top leaders, it is the symbol of China's plans for
economic development into the next century.
Dong means east and Pu is an abbreviation for Shanghai's Huangpu River, so
Pudong lies on the eastern bank of the river across from the current city
centre.
Mr Zhu Rongji, the city's mayor who has just been promoted to be a vice
premier in Peking, is the driving force behind the development which was
announced last year. Some yuan 12bn projects are planned but total
expenditure could reach yuan 30bn.
'Pudong will be a place for experimenting in new policies which maybe we can
later apply elsewhere in China,' says Mr He Gaosheng, director of the
Shanghai Office of Economic System Reform. 'It will not be capitalism but we
will bring market mechanisms into a planned economy, with public ownership
remaining the mainstay. With Pudong we can develop the whole of Shanghai and
promote development throughout the country.'
But it is difficult to envisage the plans materialising. At present Pudong,
which lies between the Huangpu and Yangtze rivers, is an uninspiring area of
broken roads, 2,000 (mostly small) factories, ramshackle chemical and gas
plants, shabby flats, and traditional-style houses.
The aim is to double the present population of 1m. The yuan 12bn expenditure
will be spread over five years or longer on a free trade zone and 10
infrastructure projects, some already started, including a four-berth deep
water port, two major river bridges, an 8km inner ring road, and new plants
for water, electricity, gas and sewage treatment.
Officials say yuan 5bn will come from Peking, yuan 4bn from domestic bank
loans, and yuan 3bn from the Shanghai government. They are looking for
foreign finance - for example from the Asian Development Bank - but do not
expect substantial international investment until the infrastructure
projects are completed.
Currently there are about 40 factories with foreign investment. They include
one of China's most successful joint ventures - a float glass plant started
with Pilkington of the UK four years ago when Pudong had no special
significance - and a Dollars 25m agricultural chemical plant planned by Du
Pont.
A showpiece multi-storey financial and trade centre is to be built across
the Huangpu River from the old Bund (or promenade). This is intended to help
Shanghai's drive to boost its service sector from 30 per cent of GNP.
China's first foreign-owned wholesale and retail businesses are also to be
admitted - Yaohan, a Hong Kong-based Japanese department store group, plans
a HKDollars 780m joint venture to open in 1995. An area has been designated
for an international airport.
It is difficult at this stage to assess how much of the grand Pudong scheme
will actually materialise. But whatever happens in the longer term, Shanghai
will at least benefit from the infrastructure projects.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (6): Time bomb ticks - Concern rises over
state of economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLINA MACDOUGALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA could face economic disaster in a year or two, even though, in
contrast with the tired old economies of the former Soviet bloc, it is
superficially prospering.
Wang Bingqian, the finance minister, speaking at the National People's
Congress in March, for the third year running called the financial situation
'extremely grim'.
Unless Peking can work a near-miracle, inflation will take off, workers will
demonstrate on the streets and the house of cards built on subsidies that is
China's current economic structure will collapse. Since even Peking's
conservatives recognise the dangers, the leadership is moving with
reluctance towards cautious reform.
Small experimental reforms are springing up all over China on a strictly
local basis, such as the introduction of stock exchanges in Shanghai and
Shenzhen. Officials such as vice-governor Ma Lin of Sichuan province enthuse
about the 'ideal way' a stock exchange raises investment funds. Secondary
markets for state bonds, previously confined to Shanghai and Chongqing, have
been successfully launched elsewhere.
Deregulation of grain prices, as in Guanghan near Chengdu, capital of
Sichuan, is happening on a trial basis. This follows price rises last year
in previously tightly controlled items such as cooking oil and cotton cloth.
The yuan was devalued on April 10 for the third time in 16 months, bringing
it to yuan 5.26 to the dollar from the late-1989 figure of yuan 3.72.
Foreign bankers in Peking were expecting a further cut of about 10 per cent.
A kind of convertibility increasingly functions through the Foreign Exchange
Adjustment Centres, where joint ventures can trade foreign exchange freely
at a market rate. Some housing reform, which either encourages tenants to
buy their apartments or permits enterprises, the main providers, to set up
separate self-financing corporations, is already under way, though this is
proving easier with new housing than apartment blocks inhabited through
several generations at peppercorn rent.
Insurance-based pensions, health services and social security payments are
also on the agenda as devices to lessen the load of the over-burdened state
enterprises which currently provide them. This would allow enterprises to
sack workers and focus on the profitability of their core activities.
But there is no sign yet that Peking will bite the bullet of abolishing
subsidies which featherbed the industrial worker and cripple state finances.
Nor will it adopt a true price reform, adopting a market system which would
help to allocate resources correctly and cut waste.
Yet an apocalyptic scenario is hard to believe when the streets are orderly,
markets appear to be booming, new office blocks and hotels adorn Peking and
provincial capitals and the shops are full of the latest electronic goodies.
Last year, China turned in a creditable economic performance with a record
harvest of 435m tonnes and a respectable GNP and industrial growth rates (5
and 6 per cent respectively). Foreign trade was up, with exports performing
well.
But, said one westerner in Peking, 'China is still living on the impetus of
the mid-1980s. While major reforms have not been rolled back, the
innovations are minor. Two years of good harvests have given economists a
chance to push for small reforms, but this year's weather is less
promising.'
When Li Peng, the hard-line premier, took over economic management from Zhao
Ziyang, the now-disgraced former party leader, in late 1988, fundamental
reform was effectively shelved. But the policies then applied (mainly an
administrative price freeze and credit controls) did nothing to solve
China's huge underlying problems of suppressed demand and inefficiency.
Potential inflation is still ticking away under the surface, fuelled by
China's growing deficit financing and subsidy policy. In 1990, Wang Bingqian
told the recent Congress that the budget deficit was, according to Chinese
accounting (which reckons government borrowing as revenue), yuan 15bn. This
was bad enough by Chinese standards, but when adjusted to reflect normal
practice was much worse at yuan 48bn.
On top of that, nearly a third of the yuan 340bn budget expenditure went on
subsidies. The central government forked out nearly yuan 58bn to the
loss-making state sector plus another yuan 38bn in individual subsidies to
compensate for price rises.
Peking is short of money anyway because of its revenue sharing system. Under
the existing semi-reformed fiscal structure, a fixed tax amount is paid by
enterprises to local authorities who then hand only a percentage to Peking.
Not only is Peking's slice relatively small (a source of serious dispute
with provincial leaders) but the fall in state enterprise profits last year
(58 per cent) meant less for everyone. This is likely to get worse since
more inflation is on the cards for this year. In 1990, credit estimated at
yuan 250-290bn was pumped into the economy to fuel industry after Li Peng's
inexpert 1988-89 freeze caused near-collapse. This enabled the government to
meet its industrial growth target for the year, but bodes ill for the
future.
Meanwhile, subsidies paid to workers continue to rise. This is seen as
essential by the unpopular leadership, which is deeply concerned to keep the
urban workforce happy and loss-making factories open. Wages are also rising
 -up by over 18 per cent in the last quarter of 1990 compared with the same
period of 1989.
Protected by Peking's reluctance to implement its bankruptcy laws, state-run
industry is growing more inefficient by the hour. Mostly old and badly run,
it is responsible for what Li Peng, in his report to the NPC, called the
'high consumption in production, low product quality, enormous waste in
construction, slow capital turnover, low labour productivity and serious
losses'.
Attempts at change are hampered by the post-Tiananmen commitment to
ideology. At the top are leaders determined to avoid the fate of the
Ceausescus by exerting party dominance. Li Peng made a special point of
stressing Marxist-Leninism in his report, though he had to signal for
applause during his three-hour speech by shouting his words to the dozing
delegates.
Still, a kind of compromise has been reached between the hard-liners and
reformists which is evident in China's new plans. Five-year programmes
(1991-95) and ten-year plans to cover the years to the end of the century
set out Peking's intentions in traditionally imprecise style. The main focus
is to be a move to give state managers more powers to deal with
inefficiencies, the improvement of infrastructure and some expenditure on
new special economic zones such as Pudong in Shanghai.
But the unhappy history of Chinese five year plans (most have been overtaken
by political upheavals before completion), inspires little confidence. If
this one avoids that fate (unlikely, in view of the extreme age of Peking's
key leaders), inflation may destroy it.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (9): Weather has the last say - Farmers
prepare for a year of lower harvests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'CHINA'S harvest last year was the best in history, but it won't be so good
this year', says Mr Zhang Shaogong, of Peking's agriculture ministry. A
serious drought gripped north China through last winter, and though snow
fell in March the year's total may fall short of last year's.
Drought has affected areas in the south, too, and these will need heavy
spring rains to replenish water supplies.
As a result, the summer-harvested crops - which make up a third of the
annual total - will definitely not reach last year's peak, and the autumn
harvest is unlikely to fill the gap. This can only aggravate China's other
economic difficulties.
Unpredictable weather explains why Peking's leadership is permanently
concerned over agriculture. 'Last year, the rains came when the crops needed
it. We dare not count on such weather again', comments Mr Zhang. 'Experience
shows we only get two good years in five.'
All agricultural sectors shone in 1990. Cotton output rose by more than 18
per cent to 4.47m tonnes, and oilseeds, which in the form of cooking oil
provide an indispensable part of Chinese cuisine, by nearly 25 per cent to
16.2 m tonnes. Meat, milk, fruit and sugar crops, increasingly adding
protein and diversity to the diet, were up substantially.
But all this plenty, especially of grain (435m tonnes), brought serious
headaches.
At the end of last year, tens of millions of tonnes were being kept in the
open air, twice the amount lying outdoors at the end of 1989, said Bai
Meiqing, vice-minister of commerce, last month. Damp and pest-ridden grains
were up by a quarter and a third respectively, he noted.
Because of cash shortages last year (the consequence of China's nationwide
financial difficulties), Peking's commercial departments could not afford to
buy more than the set quotas for storage, and the peasants were left with
grain they could not sell. This surplus is a strong disincentive to growing
more this year.
Currently the state makes contracts with the peasants to buy 50m tonnes of
grain yearly at a fixed price and in return supplies subsidised farm
chemicals and fuel. But since 1988 official policy has put pressure on
peasants to grow as much as they can, though without providing the cheap
inputs to facilitate it. Disappointed, many are now out of pocket.
As a result, said vice-premier Tian Jiyun at a conference in March, the
peasants last year won no extra income and some even sustained a loss. 'Our
farmers are getting poorer', says Ma Lin, vice-governor of Sichuan province.
Peking is right to be concerned over feeding its huge population. The
question is whether this concern is being demonstrated in the right way. The
return to individual farming (the so-called 'household responsibility
system') brought the enormous surge in farm production in the early 1980s,
but, in tune with the post-Tiananmen stress on control and ideology, the
collective is now back in vogue.
In any case, some western diplomats argue, China is worrying about the wrong
things. There is no need to stress higher grain output since enough other
foods are now produced to keep the country reasonably nourished. Allowing
market forces to operate more instead of less would bring better returns.
At least the central government is taking one sensible new approach. There
is a fresh emphasis on purchase and marketing which may enable China to
distribute grain more effectively.
Peking has set a production target of 450m tonnes of grain by 1995 and 500m
tonnes by the year 2000. This will be achieved by 'improving' (how is
unspecified) the household responsibility system, upgrading services to
farmers, stepping up the collective element in rural management,
streamlining food distribution and increasing agricultural investment.
The quality of the land itself is under scrutiny. China has many hectares of
marginal land which will be the target of investment over the current five
year plan. 'Production bases' in which Peking will invest yuan 10 bn are
being set up for grain and cotton, and more grain markets will be
established.
Some scepticism is in order here since, from the 1950s onward, in its more
apocalyptic moods Peking has urged the development of marsh and
mountainside. Similarly, grain markets have been on the agenda ever since
the mid-1980s, but without so far performing.
Today, however, there is hope since China is more aware of the environmental
damage which may result from unwise cultivation. But optimism is not
reinforced by the statement of Song Ping, one of China's top six leaders on
the Politbureau Standing Committee and its chief Marxist-Leninist guru, at a
recent agricultural conference, that 'Using socialist ideology to arm the
cadres and people of rural areas and guiding the 800m peasants to firmly
take the socialist road are the basic assurance for doing a good job in
rural work.'
This old-fashioned hard-line policy is reflected in the Central Committee's
recent order that the grassroots bureaucracy be improved, first and foremost
the party branches. Socialist ideology and spiritual construction should
take the lead. This is a far cry from Deng Xiaoping's slogan 'it is glorious
to get rich]' promulgated just a few years ago.
China would do better to forego attempts to organise its vast rural
territories and simply free the prices paid for farm products, argue some
western diplomats.
The market principle would soon beget a higher output and a better
distribution system. But this seems unlikely to happen in the present
political climate. Minor experiments in freeing the price of grain are in
progress, for instance in Guanghan county in Sichuan province, but transfer
to wider arenas does not seem likely yet.
The big success of rural China is the town and village enterprise sector.
This grew up in the heady days of the economic freedoms of the early 1980s,
when farmers were encouraged to set up small businesses. The total value of
rural output last year reached yuan 1.625 bn, of which nearly 55 per cent
was generated by local enterprise.
This is recognised nationally as the single most important factor in raising
the standard of living and even the hardest-liner has so far shown no sign
of trying to roll it back.
It is a pity Peking cannot apply the same successful principles to food
production and sales, which would obviate the need for the new stress on
village control.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (4): Two economies that overlap - Guangdong
eyes Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Ye Xuanping vacates his post as the liberal governor of the southern
province of Guangdong to take up a less powerful post in Peking during the
next few months, an almost revolutionary dream which he is believed to have
wanted to write into the eighth five-year plan may go with him, or at least
be diluted. It is to merge the economies of Guangdong and Hong Kong.
There is, however, strong opposition from hardliners in Peking who
disapprove of Guangdong's independently free-wheeling market-oriented ways.
Hong Kong also has serious reservations, partly because it does not want to
endanger its current autonomy, nor make it easy for China to renege on its
promise of a 'high degree of autonomy' after 1997.
'There are, of course, problems of our different economic and social systems
and I would not talk about merging the economies, but we would like to have
some sort of planned development,' says Mr Yi Zhenqiu, director of the
Guangdong Office of Economic Systems Reform. He envisages the creation of a
Hong Kong-Guangdong economic and trade promotion committee to act as an
industrial investment 'match-maker'.
In the past decade, Guangdong, which has a population of 64m, has become
China's most open and prosperous province, thriving on close economic links
between its Pearl River Delta area with Hong Kong. About 1.5m-2m workers in
the province are employed in factories processing partially-manufactured
foreign goods (mostly from Hong Kong) for re-export, and another 1m are in
associated activities.
As many as 50,000 technical and managerial staff from Hong Kong work
regularly in China, a lot of them in Guangdong, and 15,000 vehicles cross
the land border every day, four times as many as six years ago.
Economists estimate that 20 per cent or more of Hong Kong's currency is
openly circulating in Guangdong tourist and business outlets.
This co-operation has been good for both areas. Hong Kong companies have
gained access to cheap labour and factory premises.
Guangdong has benefited because of the consequential wealth and economic
expansion. Foreign investment totalled some Dollars 7bn during the 1980s, 90
per cent via Hong Kong.
It went into more than 10,000 joint ventures and other enterprises, mostly
involving labour intensive light industry, plus thousands of the processing
factories. The productive end of this investment has suddenly come on stream
during the past two years, so that between 25 and 30 per cent of both
Guangdong's yuan 189bn industrial output and its yuan 43.29bn industrial
exports last year were generated by factories with foreign involvement.
But there has been a price to pay in social terms because hundreds of
thousands of people regularly pour into the province looking for work. Some
make up a floating labour population of more than 1m in the processing
factories; others cannot find work and fuel a crime wave of armed robberies
and prostitution.
Guangdong is also frustrated that most Hong Kong businessmen only cash in on
the cheap unskilled processing factory labour. They rarely lay down
significant long-term industrial investment and look to other countries for
high technology.
Some labour processing factories do develop into joint ventures and so
become more permanent investments.
But relatively little progress has been made on the creation of a
technological and industrial base in relation to overall economic growth,
which last year amounted to 16 per cent. The new five year plan includes
projects which should help by improving both electricity power supplies and
road and rail transport and by creating three petro-chemical plants. The
capital of Guangzhou also wants to boost its service sector by admitting two
new foreign banks and by setting up a stock exchange.
Problems such as these prompted the idea of somehow merging the economies so
that Guangdong would benefit more, and Mr Ye also talked about relaxing
restrictions on the entry of goods from the colony into Guangdong's most
successful special economic zone of Shenzhen.
'We have not yet put forward any firm policies to Peking, but we would like
to consider using Hong Kong money to help finance raw materials plants. We
also have scientific ability which could be used to help Hong Kong
industries develop high technological products,' says Mr Yi, floating an
idea which has yet to catch on in Hong Kong.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (3): Rivals wait as the Old Guard slowly
crumbles - While crushing all dissent, the regime is split on many issues
</HEADLINE>

AS the second anniversary of the crackdown at Tiananmen Square approaches,
the Chinese leadership has reasserted its authority over a sullen but
subdued population. However, the government faces many intractable problems,
compounded by acute factional infighting which has produced a deadlock on
important decisions about policies and personnel.
Adding to the uncertainty is the advanced age and frail health of the
country's most powerful leaders, 86-year-old Deng Xiaoping, 83-year-old
economic theorist Chen Yun, and 84-year-old president Yang Shangkun. Because
of their age, many observers believe a succession struggle is already
underway. 'There is nobody in the younger leadership who has a decisive say
on policy decisions,' says a western diplomat. 'All are jockeying for
position , but they are holding back. The active phase - when Deng is dead
or incapacitated - hasn't arrived.'
The Chinese leadership is a collection of interlocking, overlapping, yet
distinct factions, now uneasily balanced, but prone to frequent conflicts,
depending on long term interests, connections and personal relationships.
Dominating the leadership today are octogenarians Deng, Chen, and Yang.
Long-time comrades and rivals, each has independent power networks
stretching back 50 years.
Deng's relationship-building dates from his early associating with Mao
Zedong in the 1930s and 1940s. Chen's connections stem from his role as the
central architect of economic planning in post-liberation China. Yang has
strong ties to the military, from the years he served as vice chairman of
the central military commission under Deng. These powerful relationships
have been further enhanced by those of his half-brother Yang Baibing, who is
head of the general political department of the People's Liberation Army.
Today, each of these aged revolutionaries has younger proteges whom they are
cultivating for the future. The most significant at the moment is Premier Li
Peng, whose patron is Chen Yun. Since the massacre in Tiananmen Square, with
which he is closely associated, Li's stature has as a consensus maker, an
economic thinker, and politician.
Although he is not Deng's chosen man, observers say Li is a leader with whom
Deng can work.
The premier has identified himself with improving the country's economy and
can take credit for reducing inflation and turning around China's balance of
payments.
But he has not addressed the country's basic structural problems, and if the
economy falters, he could become the scapegoat. Moreover, he is still
tarnished by his association with the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Jiang Zemin, secretary-general of the Communist Party, is widely seen as
Deng's protege. Formerly Communist Party secretary in Shanghai, he was
promoted by Deng to head the party after Zhao Ziyang was ousted in May 1989.
'He's got the titular crown - all he has to do is maintain it,' a western
diplomat says.
Others to watch are Shanghai mayor Zhu Rongji, Ye Xuanping, the governor of
Guangdong province, both considered reformists and Li Ruihuan, former mayor
of Tianjin and now a politburo member, who is a middle of the road figure.
At a meeting of the Chinese parliament in late March and in early April,
both Zhu and Ye were given new posts in the central government in Beijing,
with Zhu approved vice premier and Ye as vice-chairman the Chinese people's
consultative conference, an advisory council to the government. While they
may differ on many policy issues, virtually the entire leadership is said to
have agreed on the need to put the massacre of June 1989 behind them.
Closing the book on Tiananmen Square is thought to be the reason for a
series of trials this past winter in which about two dozen prominent
activists were sentenced to terms of up to 13 years on charges ranging from
counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement to sedition.
The trials and the muted public reaction to them demonstrated the
effectiveness of the government's campaign of repression. With nearly all of
the student leaders who participated in the demonstrations of spring 1989
having fled abroad, here in China the dissidents lack a broad based
movement. So few are in prison that they are unlikely to become lightning
rods of dissent. However, should opposition erupt again, these proceedings
will be used as ammunition by those voicing discontent. United as the
leadership may be on the need to quell dissent, it remains divided on many
other issues, such as disputes over price reform, the power balance between
the central government and the provinces, and the question of whether to
emphasise coastal development rather than channelling investment towards the
more backward interior.
The most critical problem is economic reform. The party recognises that
staying power rests upon its ability to provide a higher standard of living
and more consumer goods. However, that requires correcting the economy's
structural problems, such as eliminating inefficient, overstaffed and
money-losing state enterprises, stimulating a largely unmotivated work
force, and preventing the waste of precious raw materials.
But any meaningful effort to deal with these problems could erode the
party's authority and eventually lead to its downfall.
While the power of the 45m-50m member communist party is still strong,
public enthusiasm for orthodox Marxism-Leninism has already been seriously
eroded by a decade of market-oriented reforms. With traditional Chinese
social values having also been destroyed by the communists, many Chinese
have been put off by the attempt to revive ideological indoctrination after
the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Some have even turned to religion. Although the party has sanctioned this to
a limited degree, the authorities are thought to fear that the revival of
religion creates a competitive world view.
Those who now join the party now are primarily opportunists. Apart from this
battle for hearts and minds, the role of the military will also be critical
in the succession struggle. The composition of the various factions within
the armed forces is not entirely clear, but certain issues have emerged that
are challenging it to its core. Foremost is the debate over whether military
modernisation should take priority over ideological indoctrination.
There is a generational split over this issue, and divisions already present
before the Gulf war are believed to have widened. For the younger
generation, some of whom have travelled outside China, the overwhelming
American technological superiority in the Gulf war is thought to have made a
deep impact.
For them, professional competence and acquiring more modern equipment are
more important than ideological purity.
Moreover, most of the funds from a recently announced 12 per cent increase
in the defence budget are believed to be earmarked for acquiring more modern
equipment for the air force and navy. But the PLA's older generation still
believes in Mao's doctrine of a 'people's war', with its superior numbers
and greater morale being more important than technology.
Yang Baibing, the secretary general of the central military commission, is
believed to have spearheaded the drive toward s re-politicising the PLA.
Apart from modernisation, questions have been raised about the military's
role in internal security. Some feel the army should have been a last resort
in the crackdown at Tiananmen Square. After the massacre, the army was
reorganised and regional commanders loyal to the forces of Yang Shangkun
were put in charge.
However, it remains unclear which group the military will support once the
octogenarians begin to die. Both western and east European diplomats foresee
a situation comparable to 1976 when Deng Xiaoping and senior military
leaders staged a coup d'etat by arresting chairman Mao's widow and the Gang
of Four shortly after Mao's death.
Until Deng leaves the scene, the leadership remains in a political gridlock,
unwilling to take risks to face the future.

visible surplus on trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US complains that China has a Dollars 10.4bn visible surplus on its
trade with the US. It says that only Japan and Taiwan maintain larger
surpluses. As a result, US officials are pressing China to import more from
the US.
However, China claims that trade is more or less in balance, with a Dollars
1.4bn surplus in the US's favour in 1990.
One must look to Hong Kong to understand this startling difference. The US
trade figures include imports that transit the colony en route from China to
the US, and vice versa. But China regards its sales to the US via Hong Kong
as exports to Hong Kong. US products entering China from the colony are seen
as imports from Hong Kong, not the US. Neither side is ready to alter its
trade accounting practices.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (2): Quest for allies in an uncertain world
 -Foreign policy is in turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR China, as for many other countries who have for decades preyed on the
superpower conflict between the Soviet Union and the US, these are
distressing times.
Where is the counterweight to 'American hegemony', so amply and effectively
demonstrated, from Peking's point of view, in the Gulf War? Is Japan about
to rise afresh, encouraged by the US, as a military force in the Pacific?
How are the European powers, obsessed with upheavals in eastern Europe,
altering their perceptions of Asia? And how will demands for independence by
Soviet republics in central Asia upset Peking's grip on Tibet, Xinjiang and
Mongolia?
China's first instinctive response has been to offer succour to President
Gorbachev. Peking cannot feel comfortable as the sole remaining torchbearer
for international socialism. Whatever the differences with Moscow over the
correct path for the development of a socialist state, the wholesale
discrediting of the socialist model is of as little comfort to China as it
is to Moscow.
Aggravating Gorbachev's misfortunes would only increase the risk that chaos
inside a disintegrating Soviet Union would spread up to, and across, China's
central Asian borders, perhaps fomenting unrest in its own minority areas.
By standing firmly for stronger central control, and by resorting to the
military for help, Gorbachev has struck a resonant chord among China's
leadership.
There is, therefore, powerful symbolism in China's recent SFr1.5bn
'commodity loans' to Moscow - the first made to the Soviet Union by its
one-time protege, and Peking's friendliest gesture to Moscow in decades.
Next month's visit to Moscow by Jiang Zemin, China's Prime Minister, is also
the first of such seniority since Mao Zedong went there in 1957.
Alongside the symbolic succour, there is also powerful self interest. China
is keen to acquire sophisticated Soviet military hardware, in particular Su
27 aircraft. Jiang Zemin is expected to discuss the matter while in Moscow,
and a deal is expected to be signed before July.
The Gulf War has also provided a sharp shock to China's foreign policy
planners, but in diplomatic terms has been handled with dexterity. Support
for the allied cause in the UN won support in Washington. Even when Qian
Qichen, the foreign minister, opted to abstain in the UN vote authorising
the use of force against Iraq, he managed to do this without antagonising
the allies: President Bush agreed to see him on the day following the vote,
apparently against the advice of advisers. He took the view that China could
have vetoed the resolution.
At the same time, Qian managed to demonstrate through its abstention that
China remains committed to an independent foreign policy, and to its support
for Third World countries. He also preserved China's relationship with Iraq,
an important customer for Chinese arms.
China is nevertheless walking a tightrope in its relations with the US,
which were traumatised following the Tiananmen massacre two years ago. Qian
has said that the war against Iraq was 'a big hegemonist power versus a
small hegemonist'. The US in turn is harbouring anger over China's extensive
arms trade with volatile countries in the Middle East.
For China, the Gulf War was not just a striking demonstration of US military
might: it heightened anxiety over the emergence of the US as the single
dominant world superpower. There is also a nagging awareness that in the
post-Cold War era, the US needs China less than it used to.
American keenness to get Japan to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in the
Pacific - in particular through a larger naval role - also prompts alarm.
Memories of Japan as a regional military power are painful still.
Closer at hand, conflict looms with the US in the improbably-linked areas of
trade and human rights. Ever since the Tiananmen massacre, the US Congress
has put China's poor human rights record under the microscope. The recent
visit to the US by the Dalai Lama has heightened antagonism.
These issues have become linked with trade ever since Congress opted to use
the annual debate over extension of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to
trading partners as a means of punishing tyrannical governments. China
argues that this is an unacceptable intrusion into its internal affairs.
US Congressmen argue in turn that it is an internal US affair whether it
gives favourable trading status to a country or not. The fact that China now
has one of the largest visible trade surpluses with the US - more than
Dollars 10bn last year - only exacerbates the conflict.
The MFN debate starts in earnest early in June. Betting men say that, after
a bumpy ride, China will regain MFN privileges for another year. To lose
them would inflict immense damage to China's external trade and would savage
Sino-US relations.
China's response to uncertainties in relations with both the US and the
Soviet Union has been to forge new friendships where possible. A recent tour
of seven European countries by Qian Qichen was part of such a strategy.
Improved relations with India - which have been in deep chill since a short
border war in 1962 - are likely to be symbolised by a visit to Delhi later
this year by Li Peng, China's prime minister. This would be the first visit
to the Indian capital by China's head of government since the late Zhou
Enlai in 1960.
Other significant developments include decisions over the past year by Saudi
Arabia, Indonesia and Singapore to abandon diplomatic recognition of Taiwan
in favour of Peking. These constitute an important breakthrough in China's
long term diplomatic strategy of isolating Taipei. They also reinforce
China's position at the heart of the Third World community of nations, and
symbolise an easing of fears in south east Asia over expansionist communism.
These improvements give much-needed solace as China nurses anxiety over the
global power balance, but do nothing to alter the country's reflexes in
times of uncertainty. As Li Peng emphasised only two weeks ago: when 'the
old global structure has disintegrated', the priority must be to 'rely on
ourselves, work hard, and build the nation through thrift and diligence'.

PEKING is a city with an earthquake waiting to happen. Last month, it was
a-buzz with seismologists reporting that the earth's crust in north China
had been immobile for too long.
This portended a catastrophic tremor like that of 1976 which killed around a
quarter of a million people in the nearby city of Tangshan and - as it
seemed to traditionally-minded folk - foretold the death of Chairman Mao
Zedong a few weeks later.
As it happened, there was an earthquake this March, but it was several
hundred miles from Peking and has so far not rocked the leadership.
The octogenarian patriarchs who, though mostly without official posts,
effectively rule China, cling grimly to life, according to Peking stories,
by means of monthly blood transfusions and the attentions of China's most
famous 'Qigong' (traditional deep-breathing) masters.
Their relatives, retainers and vassals circle like vultures, awaiting a
death which will shift the balance in the divided leadership between the
aged reformist Deng Xiaoping and the conservatives headed by Chen Yun.
Though the present jockeying depends more on personal ties than policy, how
far to permit reform is still a potent issue.
The current balance between reformers and hard-liners is nicely illustrated
by the appointment at the recent National People's Congress of two new
Vice-premiers, Zhu Rongji, mayor of Shanghai (reformist), and Zou Jiahua,
minister in charge of the State Planning Commission (hard-liner).
But it also illustrates the near-unfathomable inter-connections between
personalities and policies.
Zou Jiahua is brother-in-law to reformist Ye Xuanping, governor of Guangdong
province. Ye, powerful son of China's now-dead head of state and Long March
general, Ye Jianying, was also appointed to a post in Peking (though a
purely formal one), apparently to remove him from his freewheeling fief in
south China where he was resisting Peking's interference.
But who is doing what to whom by these moves? Has Ye increased his power in
moving to the centre or lost it now that he's away from his home support?
Are Ye and Zou at daggers drawn because of politics because of family
relationships? If it was a loss of power for Ye to be posted to Peking, is
it not the same for Mayor Zhu Rongji? Do these appointments mean that the
reformers have gained, or the hard-liners?
The one certainty in the political fog is the growing stress on security,
particularly in Peking. Many provincial cities are relaxed and a fair number
of the reform policies of the mid-1980s continue, if sporadically.
But in the Chinese capital, police and video cameras are thick on the
streets. Particularly monitored, by video cameras, bugs or simple tailing,
are local Chinese contacts with foreigners.
In March, a new top level security committee was set up under Qiao Shi,
Number Three in China's party leadership and a lifelong policeman. Its first
meeting was held just two days after the People's Daily published a poem
which, when read diagonally, contained this hidden message: 'Li Peng (the
hard-line premier who masterminded the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989) must be
removed from power to assuage popular indignation'. Reports from Hong Kong
last week said the editor responsible was later arrested trying to flee the
country.
The leadership has reason to feel insecure. Xu Jiatun, a senior party member
and, till last year the head of the Xinhua news agency in Hong Kong, China's
de facto embassy, has defected to the US. Provincial leaders such as Ye
Xuanping are strong enough to defy the central government over issues such
as taxation.
Disaffection is rife in China's border territories of Tibet, Xinjiang and
Inner Mongolia. While China has no problem marshalling the force to deal
with this (demonstrations have been ruthlessly put down), it fears the
growing influence in the outside world of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader,
the Dalai Lama, and the effects on its other minorities of Islamic
fundamentalism and growing democracy in the former Soviet empire.
The leadership is watching the Soviet Union anxiously, backing President
Gorbachev because, unlike Boris Yeltsin, he is resisting independence for
the republics.
Alarmed by Washington's military might as displayed in the Gulf, Peking is
looking for new weaponry and hopes to buy some of the relatively advanced Su
27 Soviet combat aircraft in the next few months. The deal is likely to
figure prominently in the visit of Jiang Zemin, China's party leader, to
Moscow next month.
Peking has seen its relations with the US slide since it put down the
student demonstrators of Tiananmen in 1989. While the economic sanctions
applied thereafter were gradually repealed last year and China regained some
standing by supporting Kuwait rather than Iraq in the Gulf crisis, its arms
sales in the Middle East have earned it American fury.
This, plus its brutal handling of Tibetan and Chinese demonstrators since
and its flood of cheap exports to the US are making the re-confirmation of
its access to Most Favoured Nation treatment an uncertainty for the second
year running.
If Washington takes MFN away, Sino-US relations will nose-dive to levels not
seen for nearly two decades.
Sino-British relations are cool in the wake of the dispute over Hong Kong's
proposed new airport. Germany, previously in keen pursuit of trade and
investment with China, is preoccupied with the problems in its eastern half.
Japan, once dazzled by the size and proximity of the Chinese market, is
being actively courted by the USSR as potential fairy god-mother to Siberia.
China, for over a decade a favourite with western governments, is in danger
of being left on the shelf as the world regroups after the collapse of
Soviet communism and the Gulf war.
This comes at a time when Peking faces serious domestic economic problems.
Food shortages, inflation and unemployment are all possible flash points for
urban unrest.
In the inevitable grim comparison with the Soviet bloc, the economy is
thriving, but this is probably temporary. China has had record harvests two
years running, which have boosted light industry and food markets, but a
harvest downturn is now threatened because of damaging drought in many parts
of China.
On top of that, Peking's inability to deal with serious price distortions is
now coming home to roost.
In industry, the collective and private sector is booming but the state
sector - the backbone of China's heavy industry - is a disaster area. More
than a third of state enterprises last year made a loss, and subsidies to
featherbed industrial workers (by maintaining jobs and cheap food) came to
nearly RMB yuan 100bn, almost a third of the state's budget expenditure. The
alternative to subsidies is to close factories and raise food prices, which
the party leadership believes would enrage the urban population.
Reluctantly the hard-liners in the leadership have had to agree to some
reform as the lesser of two evils. Two small stock exchanges, plus half a
dozen centres where grain prices have been freed, a proper income tax system
and a move to give state factory managers more independence are all
currently on test. The most hopeful sign in China today is that many young
officials (educated, they'll sometimes tell you, on courses in unlikely
places like Bath, in south-west England) long to try these on a wider scale.
If China can surmount its present difficulties, they might get the chance.
But not a lot is likely to change until the present gruesome stalemate is
resolved over who in the top leadership dies first, and when.

FT  24 APR 91 / Fleet upbeat on profits at failed BNE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLEET/NORSTAR Financial Group, the new proprietor of the bankrupt Bank of
New England, is forecasting that BNE will generate annual earnings from
operations of about Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m between 1993 and 1995.
The prediction comes less than four months after BNE was declared insolvent
and seized by federal regulators in one of the biggest bank failures in US
history.
Fleet, the Rhode Island-based bank, tempered yesterday's optimism with the
warning that it expects BNE to post a loss of Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m in the
first six months after the acquisition and to break even for the first 12
months.
Fleet, in partnership with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the New York buy-out
investment boutique which is one of the most powerful takeover players in
the US, was awarded BNE's assets on Monday.
Fleet will pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Dollars 125m
as a premium, made up of Dollars 100m in preferred stock and Dollars 25m in
cash. It will also inject Dollars 500m capital into the failed bank.
In exchange, Fleet will take control of three BNE 'bridge banks', with
combined assets of about Dollars 15bn. To finance the deal, Fleet will raise
Dollars 683m of new capital, including Dollars 283m to be provided by
investors advised by KKR.
The FDIC said Fleet's offer was the least costly to the federal bank
insurance fund. However, the FDIC will absorb most of the risk associated
with the commercial property loan losses which drove BNE into liquidation.
The FDIC will assume about Dollars 5.5bn of BNE's problem assets.
Fleet will also be able to turn any additional problem assets over to the
FDIC with minimal penalties during the next three years.
Mr William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, yesterday said the agency plans to
borrow between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 5.5bn from the US Treasury's Federal
Financing Bank (FFB) as a result of resolving the BNE collapse.
This is the first time that the FDIC has taken advantage of changes last
year, authorising it to borrow working capital from the FFB. Mr Seidman said
about Dollars 3bn will be repaid from the sale of assets and about Dollars
2bn will be losses.
The FDIC has taken great pains to stress KKR's distance from the deal. It
described KKR's involvement as 'a passive investor'. But this one of the
first times that a group which is not a bank has been allowed to make a
significant capital infusion into a leading US bank.
KKR has been thwarted before in its attempts to invest in financial
institutions, including its 1989 bid for the failed Texas banks of MCorp.
In the case of the Bank of New England, KKR has already met political
opposition from Representative John Dingell, the formidable chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr Dingell warned regulators that a
joint KKR-Fleet bid might violate laws which prohibit commercial companies
from owning banks.
Under the terms of the Fleet deal, KKR investors will buy Dollars 283m of
dual convertible preferred stock. This will be convertible into 16.03m
common shares of Fleet/Norstar at Dollars 17.65 a share in no less than
three years.
In addition, KKR has warrants to buy 6.5m Fleet common shares.
On a fully-diluted basis after Fleet's common offering, KKR's investors will
have about 16 per cent of Fleet's non-voting stock.
A KKR spokesman said the firm was attracted to the BNE bid by the strength
of Fleet/Norstar's management. Fleet, which was founded 200 years ago and
has assets of Dollars 32.6bn excluding BNE, is considered one of the
best-run New England banks.
The BNE acquisition will transform it into the biggest player in the region.
Analysts said the FDIC's choice of Fleet against competing bids from
BankAmerica and Bank of Boston was a compromise decision, which would have
the least ramifications for the US banking industry.

FT  24 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Firmer tone but volume remains thin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market turned its attention back to the domestic scene
yesterday, when the FT-SE climbed painfully above 2,500 again after Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, made favourable comments on
the progress of inflation. But the immediate gain of 17.5 Footsie points,
following Mr Lamont's speech to the Institute of Directors, was trimmed
later and trading volume remained disappointing.
Equities opened lower, reacting to the further fall of 38 Dow points on Wall
Street overnight. Mr Lamont's statement that UK inflation is falling fast
revived hopes that the next cut in base rates may not be quite so far away
as feared; the market's swift response was also fuelled by firmness in stock
index futures.
The stock market topped off fairly quickly, however, also discouraged by
news of a widening in the UK monthly current account trade deficit to Pounds
432m in March. A further attempt to move forward when Wall Street opened
higher was checked when the Dow slipped back from its early high to show a
gain of about 8 points in London trading hours.
The final London reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,503.8 for a net rise of 13
points. Equity dealers found the recapture of the 2,500 area unconvincing,
largely because turnover was unimpressive.
Equity strategists continue to take a cautious view of the near-term outlook
for the equity market. However, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said there are some
grounds for mild optimism about the UK economy, in spite of 'an exceedingly
grim first quarter'. It warned that political factors could unsettle
sterling and hence keep real interest rates high.
Seaq volume of 520.6m shares yesterday, against 403m on Monday, was inflated
by turnover of 101m shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, comprised largely of a deal
of 45m shares in the advertising group, double-counted on Seaq. More
detailed data from the London Stock Exchange indicated that retail, or
customer, interest in equities continues to fall well below the Pounds 1bn
daily level still seen as the target for the London securities industry to
trade profitably.
The revived uncertainties in the industry were revealed by the decision of
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank, to pull out of the US
equities market; Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank, disclosed
financial write-offs in its US arm. However, there was better news on
progress at County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster.
The stock market was also waiting for news on the proposals to merge the
London Traded Options Market with Liffe, the London International Financial
Futures Exchange. The market took on board two more rights issues, the most
significant being a call for Pounds 162m from Taylor Woodrow, one of
Britain's largest housebuilders. The construction and building sector also
had to face a disappointing trading statement from Tarmac.
The blue chip stocks were mostly a shade firmer on the day, responding to
the more optimistic views on inflation rather than to yesterday's moves by
central banks to sell the US dollar. ICI, with first-quarter trading figures
due tomorrow, edged higher.
There was a scattering of modest gains among the high street retailers,
which continued to respond to the unexpected improvement in sales volume in
March reported this week by the Confederation of British Industry.

FT  24 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Confusion on volume in Saatchi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING volume in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi ballooned to 101m shares, of which 90m
was accounted for by Hoare Govett bringing together a seller and buyer of
45m. The Seaq ticker indicated that the transaction price was 19p. Saatchi
shares firmed  1/2 to 20 1/2 p.
The level of business drew attention to a 9.1 per cent stake held by a group
including ESL Partners, a Dallas-based finance house, and Mr Lawrence Tisch,
the chief executive of CBS, the US media company. This group underwrote part
of Saatchi's rights issue, which was completed last week.
Since the rights issue was not registered under US securities laws, ESL
(which had a large block of Europreference stock) has entered into a private
agreement with Saatchi to buy 52.6m shares at the rights price of 10p. In
addition, on Monday the group acquired 90.1m Saatchi shares in exchange for
25.8m redeemable preference shares.
In spite of much speculation to the contrary, traders and analysts close to
the company concluded that the 45m-share block and ESL's agreement were
unrelated. With over 1 1/2 bn Saatchi shares now in issue, more high levels
of turnover are likely.
Building news
There were three big developments in the building sector: the unexpected
Pounds 162.4m rights issue from Taylor Woodrow, a steep decline in profits
at Tarmac, and news that Beazer, the construction and aggregates group,
plans to spin off its UK and European businesses.
Taylor Woodrow's rights issue, a one-for-four at 200p, came as a surprise to
the market, which responded by marking the shares down to 239p. After the
initial reaction, the stock staged a rally, eventually closing only 2 off at
251p. Specialists said institutions had indicated they would support the
issue because Taylor Woodrow is seen to be one of the best-managed companies
in the construction area.
Tarmac's preliminary profits - Pounds 190.7m against Pounds 377m - were in
line with expectations but did only minimal damage to the share price. What
did hurt the stock was a gloomy post-figures meeting with analysts, who were
told that the first half of the current year had begun badly in both the UK
and the US.
Big profits downgrades were instigated, with Panmure Gordon cutting its
current year number from Pounds 190m to Pounds 125m. Tarmac shares were
heavily traded (9.5m) and closed 16 off at 229p.
Beazer settled 4 higher at 185p on 2.5m, with specialists quick to point out
the company's 20 per cent market outperformance over the last month, 68 per
cent over the last three months and 13 per cent over the last year.
BET upgraded
Business services group BET was driven higher by two reports yesterday. The
one that could be confirmed was that UBS Phillips &amp; Drew had upgraded the
stock to a trading buy.
The broker said that with the likely sale of its Biffa waste management
operation, the dividend could be held and investors should buy for the high
yield. The second story suggested that a buyer had already been found for
Biffa.
Mr Bob Carpenter of Kleinwort Benson had expected the shares to recover as
buyers were drawn by the very generous return for a FT-SE Index stock. BET
shares rose to 169p before ending 7 ahead on balance at 167p on turnover of
2.2m shares.
Cannon Street up
The refinancing operation proposed by Cannon Street Investments (CSI), the
conglomerate, received an overwhelming vote of approval and the shares
responded strongly. Analysts backed the judgment, saying the raising of
Pounds 46.7m net through a rights issue and placing of convertible
preference stock seemed to be a very sensible move.
It removes a problem, they said, by transforming gearing from 400 per cent
to 82 per cent. CSI annual profits were lower, as expected, but the dividend
distribution was maintained. The shares closed at a 1991 high of 124p, up
18.
SmithKline Beecham continued to retreat on light profit-taking, not helped
by Nikko Securities' conclusion that investors had done enough switching
from Glaxo. The former slipped 5 to 817p and Glaxo added 4 at 1076p. Before
yesterday's fall, SmithKline had gained more than 10 per cent in a month,
making it the fourth best performer in the FT-SE 100 over that period.
Fisons, down 5 at 469p, also felt the force of profit-takers in spite of
news that Merck, the world's biggest drug company, had ended research on a
potential rival to Fisons' asthma treatments. At its annual meeting
yesterday, Merck announced the abandonment of Venzair, a drug it had once
forecast would become first line therapy for asthma.
The market has been concerned that Fisons was vulnerable to new developments
in the field. 'Venzair would certainly have worried Fisons,' said one
analyst.
The prospect of first-quarter figures tomorrow from ICI continued to
unsettle trading in the stock. The price slipped 5 in early trading, then
recovered its composure to peak at 1089p before easing once again. It ended
at 1083p, up just 3 on the day. Turnover was a solid 1.5m shares.
The bullish sentiment in the oil sector - a rising crude oil price coupled
with the recent strength of the dollar - continued to drive oil shares
higher. Aiding the latest upward move by the oils was a sharp improvement in
first-quarter earnings at Mobil, the US oil group.
The heaviest turnover in the sector, 5m shares, was in BP, which moved up 5
to 354p, closely followed by Shell, 4.9m, which climbed 9 1/2 to 522 1/2 p.
The latter was boosted by the oil team at Hoare Govett, whose latest Oil
Monthly reiterated its positive stance on the sector, and focused especially
on Shell, which it views as the prime beneficiary of record downstream
margins in the Far East.
The Water Package came under another barrage of selling pressure and closed
around the day's lowest, down 23 at Pounds 2945, as more institutions, both
in London and abroad, sold their holdings or unravelled the Package units.
'This market is still extremely vulnerable and we expect this to continue at
least up until the local elections,' said one trader, in a reference to the
Labour party's policy of renationalising the water industry if it wins the
next general election.
The electricity companies, on the other hand, responded to positive
recommendations from investment analysts, with Manweb and South Wales
heavily bought after being highlighted by one of the big US investment
houses. Manweb advanced 13 to 248p and South Wales 10 to 240p.
A late downward move by British Steel was attributed to a profits
downgrading by Smith New Court. The shares held steady until the last hour
of trading, when they turned off to close 2 1/2 down at 135p.
J. Sainsbury recovered from an early loss to close a penny better on balance
at 364p as the market pondered the company's decision to redeem a Pounds
150m bond convertible into preference shares. The rise in the share price
had already prompted some bond holders to convert and so the announcement by
Sainsbury did not take the market completely by surprise.
Hammerson continued to benefit from last week's figures, subsequent buy
recommendations from analysts and presentations to institutions. The shares
were 16 stronger at one point before closing a net 9 to the good at 639p.
Volume was above average for the stock at 545,000.
McKechnie, the industrial components group, slipped 6 to 291p as analysts
adjusted full year profits estimates in the wake of lower first-half
revenue. The setback was no surprise but researchers still erred on the side
of caution, with Mr Matthew Sutherland of County NatWest moving to Pounds
23m from Pounds 25m.
Bad sentiment from Monday's profits downgradings continued to unsettle
Gestetner, the office equipment and photographic products group, and the
close was down 6 further at 207p.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Interest rate fears offset
good first-quarter results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Wall Street
COMMENTS from the Federal Reserve chairman about interest rate policy took
the shine off share prices yesterday after the market had opened firmer in
the wake of some strong first-quarter company results, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 2.73 at 2,930.45,
and then only thanks to a last-minute spurt of buying. In the morning the
index had been almost 18 points ahead, but steadily receded to stand down 11
points on balance at 3pm.
The broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, finishing
a marginal 0.81 up on the day at 381.76. The Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks held on to its gain more tenaciously to end 1.70
higher at 496.08.
Turnover on the New York SE remained light, totalling 168m shares, while
advancing issues only just kept ahead of declines by 829 to 777.
News of a much larger than expected 6.2 per cent fall in factory orders of
durable goods during March exerted a two-way pull on sentiment at the start
of trading. While the figures illustrated the extent of industry's slump,
they raised hopes that the Fed might reduce interest rates again to boost
economic activity.
Prices fell after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, outlined his view to
a Senate committee that the current level of inflation did not justify
further cuts in interest rates.
Among a string of companies reporting good first-quarter results, RJR
Nabisco put on Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 11 5/8 on turnover of 3.8m shares.
The tobacco and foods group announced its first quarterly profit, of Dollars
5m, since it was taken private in 1989 in the world's largest-ever takeover,
via a Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out.
The most improved results continued to come from the securities industry.
Salomon rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32 3/4 on revealing a doubling in
first-quarter net income to a record Dollars 273m, and Morgan Stanley gained
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 87 3/8 on a 46 per cent climb in quarterly earnings
to Dollars 120m.

FT  24 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Data and bank sales hit dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell back on weak US economic figures and co-ordinated central
bank intervention yesterday. The German Bundesbank led an attack by central
banks when the US currency was trading at around DM1.7540 during the
European morning. It later retreated to a low of DM1.7375 in the face of
unexpectedly weak US durable goods orders.
Data on durable goods orders are regarded as volatile and not a reliable
guide to economic trends, but dealers were still surprised that orders in
March fell 6.2 per cent against expectations of a 0.2 per cent increase.
It was the first time that the Bundesbank had intervened on the open market
since mid-March. Other European central banks, including the Bank of
England, appeared to sell dollars for D-Marks yesterday, although it was not
until after the durable goods figures were announced that the dollar came
under any pressure in the market.
Comments by US officials also had a depressing influence on the currency,
with Mr David Mullins, a Federal Reserve governor, saying the US economic
recovery may not be very robust.
In testimony before the Senate banking committee, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal
Reserve Board chairman, said the economy appears to be still moving modestly
lower, but all indications are that the recession will bottom out within a
'reasonably short period'.
He added that the Fed is keeping its options open on interest rates and is
'looking at the economy on a day by day basis'.
At the close in London, the dollar had fallen to DM1.7420 from DM1.7660; to
Y137.90 from Y139.40; to SFr1.4590 from SFr1.4795; and to FFr5.8750 from
FFr5.9475. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index declined 0.6 to
66.5.
Sterling gained ground with other European currencies against the dollar,
but was replaced by the Italian lira as the second strongest member of the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Political risk is beginning to have a nervous effect ahead of next week's
local elections in England and Wales. Recent economic news has also caused
some concern.
Erratic items were blamed by the authorities for yesterday's news that the
UK current account deficit widened to Pounds 432m in March from the previous
month's Pounds 227m, but dealers regarded the rise of 3.5 per cent in
imports as worrying.
Mr Nick Parsons, economist at Union Discount, said the official explanation
was simply not good enough, given that the February improvement was entirely
the result of the fourth largest surplus on erratic items since records
began.
The pound regained 1.90 cents to Dollars 1.7115, but slipped to DM2.9825
from DM2.9900; to SFr2.4975 from SFr2.5050; and to FFr10.0550 from
FFr10.0650. It was unchanged at Y236.00. The sterling index improved 0.1 to
91.7. In New York the pound finished a further 15 points firmer at Dollars
1.7130.

FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC farm ministers focus on
imbalances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC AGRICULTURE ministers yesterday put to one side their increasingly
sterile confrontation over this year's farm spending limits, and focused
instead on the specific market imbalances that threaten to break the
Community's agriculture budget.
The 12 ministers - in their third attempt to break the deadlock over price
cuts put forward by Brussels to keep spending within the mandatory farm
'guideline' - took their shopping lists to the Luxembourg presidency of the
EC and Mr Ray MacSharry, agriculture commissioner.
The hope is that the presidency and the European Commission can distill from
this a compromise to lay before the next council of agriculture ministers in
Brussels on May 21-22.
However, this looks optomistic because more than synthesis will be required
to resolve the central dispute - whether an increase of the Ecu32.5bn
(Dollars 40bn) guideline for this year is justified by the cost of bringing
east German farmers into the Common Agricultural Policy. The UK, backed by
the Netherlands, say no, while their colleagues, led by France and Ireland,
argue that it is.
A majority of delegations felt yesterday that some sort of agreement was
unlikely before June, a sentiment clear enough to become a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
Commission officials, although they believe that a settlement that late
means the CAP could run short of funds by October, were encouraged by the
sight of ministers engaging with the details of the price package for 1991.
There were, however, few signs of suggestions that would reduce spending.
One exception was the UK argument that milk quotas should be cut by 4-5 per
cent, instead of 2 per cent as the Commission wants. Mr John Gummer, the
British agriculture minister, said that farmers know a second cut will have
to follow one of 2 per cent.
Mr MacSharry said late on Monday that if no action was taken to reduce
prices and cut overproduction, EC stockpiles of surplus food would grow by
this time next year to 28m tonnes of cereals (from a record 20m now); to 1m
tonnes of butter and skimmed milk (725,000 tonnes); and a record 1m tonnes
of beef, from 750,000 tonnes now.
'The only limit on intervention stocks now is the lack of storage space,'
one Commission official remarked.

FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Botswana tries to loosen De
Beers' grip - The world diamond cartel faces strong calls for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS FOR a new contract between Botswana, the world's most important
diamond producer in value terms, and De Beers, the South African group which
controls 80 per cent of the market for rough (uncut) diamonds, are taking
much longer than expected. The previous three-year contract ended on
December 31.
Some Botswana politicians want to change De Beers' exclusive sales contract
so that part of their country's output can be sold independently of the
South African group's international cartel. This would give Botswana its own
'market window' to see what its diamonds are worth in the free market.
De Beers is resisting any change. Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, chairman of the
group's Central Selling Organisation, argues that if Botswana chose not to
sell its production exclusively through his organisation, the CSO's ability
to regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be compromised.
He said: 'Because the major (diamond) producers freely consent to sell
exclusively through one channel, the CSO is able to preserve an orderly
market by matching rough diamond sales closely to consumer demand.'
However, IDC (Holdings), a London-based group which claims to be the most
experienced and substantial dealer in rough diamonds independent of the CSO,
suggests the CSO's attitude 'is unreasonable and based on a conceptual
argument with little substance in fact.'
In presentations to Botswana's Minerals Policy Committee and members of
parliament, IDC has been arguing that, not only was it commercially
essential for Botswana to understand the real value of its diamond output,
but that the country had a political responsibility to do so.
'Data accumulated independently of the CSO would put Botswana in a position
to have more input into the arrangements for the sale of its diamonds,' IDC
pointed out. 'On a political level this would enable the government to
answer its critics or its electors with confidence and sure knowledge when
questioned about arrangements for the disposal of the country's mineral
assets.'
If Botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production, worth
about USDollars 100m, independently of the CSO - which sells about Dollars
4bn-worth a year from all over the world - it would represent no threat to
market stability, IDC said.
It claims analysts have estimated that 50 per cent of De Beers' diamond
profits in 1989 came from Botswana. 'This profit is disproportionate to the
sale of diamonds by Debswana (De Beers' subsidiary in Botswana) to the CSO
as a percentage of the CSO's total sales profits,' IDC says.
'It is not unreasonable to reflect whether the fact that Botswana is the
only major producer currently selling 100 per cent of its production to the
CSO has any bearing on the substantial profits made by the CSO on the sale
of its diamonds.'
Other substantial producers such as the Soviet Union, Angola, Zaire and
Australia do not sell all their production to the CSO and therefore have
access to independent market information.
IDC does have a vested interest. It already markets diamonds for producers
in Guinea, Guyana, Brazil and the Central African Republic, and is offering
to do some marketing for Botswana.
It acknowledges that all sectors of the diamond trade welcomed the CSO's
efforts to keep the diamond market stable. But 'the fact that the CSO forms
part of an aggressive, profit-motivated public company with a primary
responsibility to its shareholders is often lost from view.'
De Beers says Botswana diamonds do not contribute half its diamond account
profits - but it will not divulge the true figure.
It suggests IDC's arguments are flawed because they are based on an
assumption that Botswana needs more market information. However, in common
with other producers selling diamonds to the CSO, Botswana has appointed
independent valuers who continuously monitor diamond production and the
prices paid.
According to the CSO, these valuers are fully informed about market
conditions and the prices received for Botswana stones.
Mr Geoffrey Leggett at IDC suggests, however, the valuer only ensures that
the assortment of diamonds from Botswana conforms to an agreed sample and
that the agreed contract price is paid. 'He is not a trader, he does not
know what the stones are worth in the market.'
De Beers insists it remains on cordial terms with Botswana and says the
country is still selling its diamonds through the CSO. It is not the first
time that contract negotiations have gone on past the theoretical deadline.
The Botswana government recently set up a diamond cutting centre with De
Beers' technical help, and this, too, should further the country's
understanding of the market.
There has been a special relationship between the CSO and Botswana since
1987 when the country sold its diamond stockpile to De Beers in exchange for
an estimated USDollars 250m and a 5.27 per cent shareholding in the South
African group.
Analysts suggest market conditions do not help Botswana press its case. De
Beers, which itself mines about 40 per cent of the world's annual rough
diamond output, markets stones from Angola, Australia, Namibia, Tanzania,
Zaire and the Soviet Union, as well as South Africa and Botswana.
Prices of rough diamonds, with few exceptions, have moved upwards every year
since the 1930s depression. But now De Beers is steering the world's most
successful cartel through depressed market conditions caused by the
recession in the US (the biggest single market for diamonds), sogginess in
Japan (the second-largest), and the Gulf war.
To maintain price stability, the CSO is stockpiling diamonds at great
expense, rather than releasing unwanted stones to the market. Its
promotional budget has been lifted by 20 per cent to more than Dollars 1m a
week - Dollars 53m for the year.
In addition, Botswana this year faces its first budgetary deficit since 1982
and, according to De Beers' calculations, one of its diamond mines  - Orapa
 -needs investment of USDollars 600m.
The CSO has also notched up some recent coups: bringing a big part of the
Soviet Union's and Angola's rough diamond output back into the cartel - or
what it calls its 'single channel marketing' - arrangements.
However, the CSO is also currently involved in contract negotiations with
Argyle Diamonds, the western Australian company which is the biggest
individual diamond producer in volume (but only sixth in value) terms.
Argyle, too, wants to stay with the CSO when its contract ends on May 1 -
but on more favourable terms.
A delegation from Botswana is to meet CSO representatives in London at the
end of this month for another attempt to break the deadlock. The industry is
betting that Botswana will give way, perhaps in return for De Beers helping
to finance the Orapa mine investment. However, the 'market window' idea is
unlikely to be dropped and will almost certainly be raised again when the
next contract negotiations start.

FARMERS are unlikely to be able to make money by diversifying into
production of materials for use in the energy, chemical and packaging
industries, according to a House of Lords select committee report out today.
The report says that though there is 'great promise' there are also many
technological difficulties. However, the major hurdle is the fact that
'agricultural feedstocks are not currently competitive with hydrocarbons and
other feedstocks. Without some convergence in prices, industry will not make
the investment necessary to enable new markets to be developed and
exploited.'
Non-Food Uses of Agricultural Products. Select Committee on the European
Communities. HMSO. Pounds 22.75.
The US Meat Export Federation estimates that it could sell between 30,000
and 50,000 tonnes of high quality beef a year to the EC if it were allowed
access to the market. But, said Mr Philip Seng, chief executive officer,
trying to get into the market was comparable to the myth of Sisyphus.
US beef imports to the EC are hampered by the ban on growth hormones and a
directive on the standard of slaughterhouses, as well as tariff and quota
regulations. 'Some US traders say Europe is more protectionist than the
Japanese market,' said Mr Seng, who is in London for the World Meat
Congress, which opens today.

FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rise to nearly
Dollars 20 then fall back sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES fell sharply yesterday after rising almost Dollars 1 a barrel
over the last two days in line with strong prices for gas oil in Europe and
gasoline in the US.
The price for North Sea Brent crude to be delivered in June slipped 0.2
cents to Dollars 19.425 a barrel yesterday after touching almost Dollars 20
a barrel at mid-session.
North Sea prices were depressed late yesterday by a weaker New York market
where the June futures contract slipped to Dollars 20.90 a barrel. 'There's
been a lot of technical buying over the last few weeks and as we go down
those people will be exiting the market, which will push it even lower,'
said Mr Andy Lebow at ED &amp; F. Man.
Gas oil prices have been boosted by the unseasonally cold weather in Europe
which has given a temporary fillip to demand, particularly from Germany. At
the same time, US petrol stocks have been run down to minimum operating
levels, giving rise to fears of shortages as the nation enters its peak
driving season in the next few weeks.
Imports of petrol to the US have been low as higher prices have sucked
deliveries into Europe. But cargoes are now arriving in the north-eastern US
again and are starting to relieve any tightness in the market with the
attendant depressing effect on prices.
North Sea Brent traders rushed to buy oil on Monday when Chevron announced
it would pull one of its cargoes from the May delivery programme in the
North Sea. The company will start maintenance work on the Ninian pipeline
next month.
But Mr Peter Gignoux at Lehman Brothers said, 'there is plenty of foreign
crude around and I think traders are beginning to realise this.'
Iranian tankers that were anchored off the Bay of Cadiz near Spain are
understood to have set sale, prompting traders to speculate that Iran is
beginning to sell its oil in floating storage.

VENEZUELA'S foreign debt has been placed under review for a possible upgrade
by Moody's Investor Service, the US rating agency. Venezuela has outstanding
debt totalling around Dollars 1bn in the Euromarkets, according to the
agency.
The debt is denominated in D-Marks and yen, as well as dollars.
Moody's said the review was prompted by the Venezuelan government's efforts
to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and to liberalise the economy. The
government has also restructured its external finances with creditor banks,
Moody's noted.
The move marks a further step in the increasing acceptability of Latin
American borrowers in the Euromarkets. For example, Petroleos de Venezuela,
the Venezuelan oil company, raised DM200m last October.

FIVE Mexicans were accused yesterday by the US Securities and Exchange
Commission of profiting from inside information when buying shares in Anchor
Glass, an American glass company bought by Vitro of Mexico in 1989.
The five Mexicans include a former director of exports at Vitro, Mexico's
largest industrial company, and a prominent investor Mr Ernesto Tinajero.
According to the charges, the investors bought 150,000 shares of Anchor
Glass for USDollars 1.7m. After the Vitro bid for Anchor Glass was announced
the shares were sold netting the investors a profit of Dollars 1.2m.
Insider trading is widely believed to be prevalent in the Mexican bourse,
but Mexican authorities are much laxer than those in the US in enforcing
rules against it.
The Monterrey newspaper El Norte suggested that the Anchor Glass case should
be a lesson for Mexican regulators.

FT  24 APR 91 / Government Bonds: Treasuries firmer on drop in durable goods
orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US GOVERNMENT bond prices firmed yesterday after a large decline in monthly
durable goods orders revived hopes of another interest rate cut.
In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 5/16
at 95 5/8 , yielding 8.265 per cent. The two-year note was up 1/32 at 100
5/32 , to yield 7.016 per cent.
The morning news which sparked the gains was the 6.2 per cent fall in new
factor orders for durable goods in March, a decline well in advance of
market expectations.
The figures suggested that the economy remains depressed, and they add to
the pressure on the Federal Reserve for another cut in interest rates to get
the economy moving. However, at a Senate committee hearing yesterday, Mr
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, hinted that recent inflation numbers did
not justify another rate cut.
His comments brought prices down from their highs, as did worries about the
effect on the market of the upcoming Treasury note auction.
NEWS that the Dutch state will launch its first 15-year bond boosted the
Dutch government bond market yesterday.
The new bond is due in June, 2006, has an 8.5 per cent coupon, and is not
callable. It will be sold through a series of tap sales starting on April
25.
Traders said there was strong demand among domestic pension funds and
insurers. Many switched out of 10-year Dutch government bonds to buy the new
15-year bond in the grey market as the longer maturity provides a better
match for their liabilities. The price of the new bond rose from 99.15 to
close at 99.8, yielding 8.52 per cent.
In Germany, bund prices edged up in what traders described as a technical
correction following Monday's fall. News that the Bundesbank left its
one-month security repurchase rate unchanged at 8.60 per cent also provided
some support for bunds, traders said.
The unchanged security repurchase rate was taken as a sign that the official
discount rate would not be raised. However, currency players interpreted
this as a lack of support for the D-Mark and wondered whether it would be
allowed to slide against the dollar or whether central bank intervention
would support it.
Several central banks intervened in the markets, selling dollars for D-Marks
yesterday.
IN London, gilts moved up in quiet trading ahead of today's auction for a
Pounds 1.2bn tranche of 10 per cent conversion stock due 1996. Bids are due
in the morning and traders expect most or all of the stock to be bought. The
spread of bids is expected to be rather tight given the probable strong
demand for the stock.
The existing stock is already trading at around 98.2 in the market, but the
auction stock has the advantage of being part-paid (investors need only pay
50 per cent of the price if their bids are accepted) with the rest of the
money due at the end of May.
JAPANESE government bond prices rose yesterday in quiet trading.
The market expects the auction today to be for another tranche of the No 140
bond which is due in December 2001 and has a 6.6 per cent coupon. Traders
expect about Y800bn of the stock to be auctioned but expressed concern over
the lack of appetite for new issues.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened in Tokyo at 6.735 per cent, moving
to 6.69 per cent, and trading in London at around 6.715 per cent.

CRAY RESEARCH, the world's leading maker of supercomputers, yesterday turned
in first-quarter net income of Dollars 5.2m, or 20 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 143m, compared with net earnings of Dollars 9.5m, or 33
cents, on revenues of Dollars 135.9m a year earlier.
Mr John Rollwagen, chairman and chief executive, said the contract value of
orders signed in the first three months of 1991 fell to Dollars 67m from
Dollars 80m a year earlier. He attributed the decline to the limited
availability of new products and to the large number of orders signed in the
1990 first quarter.
The company's backlog at the end of the quarter was Dollars 315m, compared
with Dollars 300m a year earlier.
Mr Rollwagen said Cray's order backlog and prospect list 'continue to
indicate that we can meet our growth objectives for 1991. However, most of
our installation and order activity will occur in the second half of the
year.'

Quaker Oats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER pet food profits were a key contributor to Quaker Oats' 4 per cent
rise in earnings from continuing operations in the three months ended March
1991.
Earnings for the period, which is the Chicago-based food processor's third
fiscal quarter, rose to Dollars 63.1m, or 82 cents a share, from Dollars
60.4m, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier.
Net sales climbed to Dollars 1.33bn from Dollars 1.27bn.
Last year's third-quarter figures exclude a Dollars 34.8m loss suffered by
Fisher-Price, the toy maker which the group plans to spin off to
shareholders.
Quaker said yesterday that the deal is awaiting completion of an internal
audit required to transfer the business to a new corporation.
Nonetheless, it hopes to complete the spin-off by June 30.
Operating income dropped by 8 per cent, largely due to lower profits from
Brazil.
But this was more than offset by a near-halving in financing costs, due to
lower interest rates in Brazil.
Both North American and overseas operations were bolstered by strong sales
of pet food.
US sales were helped by a relaunch of a key dog food brand.
Mr William Smithburg, Quaker's chief executive, said he expects 'solid'
earnings growth in the current quarter and the largest percentage of
quarterly earnings for the year.

Earnings climbed to Dollars 557m, or Dollars 1.59 a share, from Dollars
473m, or Dollars 1.33, a year earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 10.8bn from
Dollars 9.3bn.
Despite the sharp increase for the period as a whole, Mr Ken Derr, Chevron
chief executive, noted that earnings slid towards the end of the period as
crude oil prices settled at lower levels, US refining margins began to
erode, and prices and demand for natural gas moved down.
Refining and marketing income soared to Dollars 233m from Dollars 130m. This
year's profits would have been even higher without a Dollars 47m charge for
environmental provisions and asset write-offs.
Sales of natural gas in the US edged down to just under 3m cubic feet a day,
from 3.1mcf last year. Foreign gas output rose 8 per cent.
Income from chemicals dipped to Dollars 73m from Dollars 123m, but last
year's figure included a Dollars 59m gain from chemicals licensing
agreements. Operating earnings rose by 14 per cent.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Delta in talks with Pan Am
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DELTA, the third largest US airline, said yesterday that it was in
discussions with Pan Am, the smaller carrier which earlier this year filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, about 'potential asset acquisitions in
the airline business', writes Nikki Tait.
But, in contrast to recent speculation, Delta fell short of saying that it
was interested in a full merger of the two companies. It also emphasised
that no definitive agreement had yet been reached, and said that there was
no assurance that a deal would be struck.
However, it seems unlikely that Pan Am - which has been disposing of assets
for many years - would be willing to sell off its remaining business
piecemeal.
'We're not interested in selling parts of the company,' commented the New
York-based carrier yesterday, although it has previously said that its East
Coast Shuttle was up for sale.
There was further evidence of the turbulence which hit the airline sector
earlier this year when USAir Group, one of the middle-ranking US carriers,
revealed a Dollars 168.7m after-tax loss in the first three months. This
compared with a Dollars 38m loss in the same period of 1990. Revenues stood
at Dollars 1.58bn (Dollars 1.54bn), while the passenger load factor fell to
54.1 per cent (57.2 per cent).

MCDONALD'S, the world's largest fast food chain, yesterday delivered a 10.4
per cent improvement in first-quarter earnings at Dollars 168.5m after tax,
write our New York staff. Sales were up 6 per cent at Dollars 4.53bn.
The company said its US sales had benefited from special marketing and
promotional programmes, such as its 'Grilled Steak Sandwich' and 'Happy

Outside the US, sales continued to show strong growth.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Whirlpool sees earnings down
17.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROBLEMS in its difficult home market left Whirlpool, the world's largest
maker of home appliances, reporting a 17.2 per cent fall in first-quarter
earnings at Dollars 24m after tax, against Dollars 29m in 1990.
Sales fell marginally, to Dollars 1.62bn from Dollars 1.64bn last year.
Whirlpool said part of the decline reflected continuing difficulties with
its Brazilian affiliates. The Michigan - based company took in a net loss of
Dollars 17m from its equity interest here, and said operations were hampered
by a price freeze on many consumer durable items.
It added that, if the effect of the Brazilian business were excluded,
underlying earnings were down by 15 per cent from the first quarter of 1990.
Whirlpool distinguished between its European operations, which fared well
during the quarter, and the domestic position. On the former, it said sales
and earnings from its joint venture with Philips, the Dutch electrical
group, improved from the previous year, helped by volume growth and
favourable currency translation.
In the US, Whirlpool conceded that shipments declined - although it said its
own decline was less than the industry average , which showed a 16 per cent
fall.
Mr David Whitman, chairman, said he expected a 'gradual recovery' in this
area.

offer
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE SCHNEIDER, the French electrical products maker, revealed yesterday
it was willing to increase its offer for Square D, of Illinois, if a merger
along the lines it has proposed can be agreed promptly.
But, according to a trade paper report, Square D is seeking finance for a
leveraged recapitalisation.
In a letter to Mr Jerre Stead, Square D chairman, Mr Didier
Pineau-Valencienne, Schneider's chairman, urged the Square D board not to
enter into any commitment or course of action that would deny Schneider the
chance to negotiate its proposal 'on an equal basis'.
Square D has spurned a Schneider offer made last February of Dollars 78 per
share, or Dollars 1.9bn, which it considers inadequate. The offer has,
however, lead to Square D's shareholders tendering 78 per cent of the
company's shares.
In a March filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Square D said
it would pursue the possibilities of a leveraged buyout or reorganisation,
as well as finding another partner for a merger or alliance.
According to a report yesterday in the daily trade paper, The American
Banker, the US company recently asked seven US banks to consider providing
more than Dollars 1bn in financing for a leveraged recapitalisation.
The deal would be the largest leveraged recapitalisation in more than a
year.
A recapitalisation could be used to declare a special dividend which would
serve as compensation for not selling to Schneider. The price of Square D's
shares have appreciated some 50 per cent since the Schneider offer.
Although a large percentage of shares has been tendered, their purchase by
Schneider cannot be completed until the Square D board agrees to two
conditions: first, that it lift its legal obligation requiring a hostile
takeover bidder to acquire 85 per cent of the shares; and, second, that it
remove a poison pill provision from company by-laws. The board has so far
refused to do so.

STRONG markets, especially for central office switching equipment, and
inclusion of Britain's STC's results brought record profit, revenues and
orders for Northern Telecom in the first quarter.
Northern, controlled by BCE, the Montreal telecommunications holding
company, reported earnings of USDollars 88.1m, or 36 cents a share, up 20
per cent from USDollars 73.5m, or 30 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of
USDollars 1.85bn against USDollars 1.57bn.
Mr Paul Stern, chairman, said that, despite the recession, world political
and economic uncertainties and tough competition, demand was good for
virtually all Northern's products. STC and Northern have been integrated 'to
support our strategy of growth through globalisation.'
Overall expenses were up slightly to 19.8 per cent of sales, but this ratio
should improve later in the year. Total research spending was USDollars
207m, against USDollars 176m, or 11 per cent of total revenues, about
unchanged.

first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WIDE refining margins prevalent throughout the oil industry lifted
Texaco's earnings by 26 per cent in the first quarter.
Thanks to a doubling in operating profits from refining and marketing,
earnings of the US's third biggest integrated oil company rose to Dollars
415m, or Dollars 1.51 a share, from Dollars 328m, or Dollars 1.15, a year
earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 10.2bn from Dollars 9.2bn.
But operating earnings from exploration and production fell to Dollars 282m
from Dollars 317m. The company ascribed the drop to maintenance of UK
facilities, lower heavy crude prices in the US, and the impact of the mild
North American winter on natural gas volumes and prices.
These negative factors were only partly offset by higher crude output in
Indonesia and production from a new field in China.
First-quarter capital spending jumped by a third to Dollars 791m, due
largely to expanded exploration and production activity in the US and the
North Sea.
Phillips Petroleum suffered a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings due
largely to several non-recurring and non-operational items. Net earnings
fell to Dollars 160m, or 62 cents a share, from Dollars 259m, or Dollars
1.06, a year earlier.
Without these items, which include a Dollars 70m gain from asset sales this
year and special gains last year of Dollars 148m, earnings would have risen
to Dollars 149m from Dollars 107m. Revenues rose to Dollars 3.5bn from
Dollars 3.1bn.

<TEXT>
NCR, the Ohio-based computer company which has been fighting the bid
advances of AT&amp;T for the past five months, yesterday modified its lingering
opposition to AT&amp;T's revised all-share offer proposal.
In a letter to his counterpart at AT&amp;T, Mr Charles Exley, NCR's chairman,
said that he would be willing to recommend the offer if AT&amp;T was prepared to
ensure that it was worth Dollars 110 per NCR share while the AT&amp;T share
price stayed at, or above, Dollars 32.50.
The target company claimed yesterday that it was adjusting its position in
attempt to be 'flexible'. Its earlier stance had worried some investors - in
particular, the arbitrage community - who felt that its demands were
'onerous'. There was no immediate response from AT&amp;T.
AT&amp;T commenced the bidding for NCR five months ago with a Dollars 90-a-share
cash offer, while NCR said that it was looking for Dollars 125 a share.
However, NCR subsequently dropped this request to Dollars 110 a share, and
at the weekend AT&amp;T said it would meet this figure, but switched from cash
terms to a paper consideration.
Mr Exley then said that he was concerned about a fall in the AT&amp;T share
price between now and the stage at which the offer closed.

<TEXT>
HOLMES Protection, the New York-based security company which has missed
several payments on a Dollars 61m (Pounds 36m) loan note, hopes to hear
within days whether a crucial asset sale has received backing from bankers.
Mr John Flack, joint chief executive, said Alert Centre should inform Holmes
within a few days if it has secured financing to buy the New Jersey security
business for Dollars 18m.
The proceeds of this sale would go some way to placating institutions which
were due a total Dollars 24.6m loan repayment in January and March.
Mr Flack was speaking in London, where the company is quoted, after
reporting pre-tax profits of Dollars 4.02m for 1990, including a Dollars
5.05m profit on the sale of assets that was taken above the line, compared
to a loss of Dollars 20.31m in 1989.
Auditors have classified the Dollars 61m debt as a current obligation and
have qualified the accounts subject to the company's ability to continue as
a going concern. Earnings rose to 5 cents (losses of 30 cents) per share.
The dividend is passed.
Turnover fell to Dollars 68.70m (Dollars 76.05m) and interest charges jumped
to Dollars 7.29m (Dollars 5.84m).

FT  24 APR 91 / Kleinwort Benson in Dollars 23m write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson, the London merchant banking group, has had to write off
loans totalling Dollars 23m (Pounds 13.6m) to a US development capital
company founded by a former director.
The loss was disclosed in the group's latest annual report released
yesterday.
The loans were made to companies linked to Mr Kenneth McCormick, an American
banker who was hired by Kleinwort Benson in the mid-1980s to set up and run
a swaps business in Los Angeles called Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing
(KBCF). Mr McCormick became a director both of KBCF and Kleinwort Benson
Ltd, the merchant banking arm of the group.
According to the annual report, the Kleinwort group made a series of loans
beginning in 1987 to Ojai Capital, a partnership founded by Mr McCormick, to
finance start-ups and property investments in California. Loans were also
made to Kenneth McCormick &amp; Co, a company set up by Mr McCormick to provide
management services to KBCF.
The loans amounted to Dollars 15m by the end of 1989. Last year further
loans, plus unpaid interest and unreimbursed expenses amounted to an
additional Dollars 5.81m. In May KBCF advanced Mr McCormick's company a
further Dollars 1.92m.
But later last year Kleinwort decided that Ojai Capital was not financially
viable, and it decided to sever its connections with Mr McCormick's
companies. It made a full provision against the Dollars 22.73m owed by them.
It also terminated its operating agreement with Kenneth McCormick &amp; Co,
incurring in the process a Dollars 2.4m payment.
As part of a settlement agreement, Kleinwort has waived all claims against
McCormick and Ojai, and was itself also released from any claims from Mr
McCormick and his business interests. Mr McCormick resigned his Kleinwort
directorships in February.
He was not immediately available for comment last night.
The loss comes at a difficult time for Kleinwort. The group recently
reported an overall loss of Pounds 68m before tax for 1990, largely because
of a Pounds 34m loss on a misjudged block trade in Premier Oil shares.

FT  24 APR 91 / Time runs out for trading in the pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and JIM MCCALLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIT trading of equity options is to be abolished in favour of a screen-based
system, under recommendations to be sent to members of the London Traded
Options Market and the London International Financial Futures Exchange
today.
Officials said the merger of LTOM and Liffe was still planned before the end
of the year.
But certain issues, such as trading procedures at the new exchange, will
have to be re-examined if members agree to the proposal.
Only index-linked options - the FT-SE 100 contract and the FT-SE Eurotrack
100 contract due to be launched in June - will still be traded under the
open-outcry system.
Job losses among the 40 or so firms which trade on LTOM are expected, at
least in the short term. A senior dealer said the reaction among traders
when word of the proposals filtered into the market was one of shock. 'It's
all happening too quickly,' he said with many dealers worrying that they
could soon become redundant.
The change is intended to tackle chronically low volume in the stock options
market. In the US, the volume of equity derivatives is equivalent to 140 per
cent of the underlying stock market, compared with just 20 per cent in
London.
Unreliable price quotations deter retail investors, while dealers dislike
the lack of anonymity which often means revealing their trading in the stock
market.
'The only practical way we can see to achieve anonymity is through a fully
automated trading system,' said Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive of
Liffe.
Liffe and LTOM are proposing a move to 'a fully automated market which, in
addition to allowing anonymity, would also incorporate automated quotation
mechanisms for all market-makers, small-order automated execution and a
facility for negotiating block trades'.
But some of the large institutions, which account for most of the business
in the options market, were uncertain whether a screen-based system would
increase turnover.
Despite such reservations, changes which will promote a successful merger
will be welcomed by the Bank of England.
Having initially played the role of marriage broker, the Bank is keen to see
the union consumated and is unlikely to be concerned by the relegation of
share options to a trading screen.

FT  24 APR 91 / BNE proprietor forecasts annual profit of Dollars 150m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLEET/NORSTAR Financial Group, the new proprietor of the bankrupt Bank of
New England, is forecasting that BNE will generate annual earnings from
operations of about Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m between 1993 and 1995.
The prediction comes less than four months after BNE was declared insolvent
and seized by federal regulators in one of the biggest bank failures in US
history.
Fleet, the Rhode Island-based bank, tempered yesterday's optimism with the
warning that it expects BNE to post a loss of Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m in the
first six months after the acquisition and to break even for the first 12
months.
Fleet, in partnership with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the New York buy-out
investment boutique which is one of the most powerful takeover players in
the US, was awarded BNE's assets on Monday.
Fleet will pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Dollars 125m
as a premium, made up of Dollars 100m in preferred stock and Dollars 25m in
cash. It will also inject Dollars 500m capital into the failed bank.
In exchange, Fleet will take control of three BNE 'bridge banks', with
combined assets of about Dollars 15bn.
To finance the deal, Fleet will raise Dollars 683m of new capital, including
Dollars 283m from investors advised by KKR.
The FDIC said Fleet's offer was the least costly to the federal bank
insurance fund. However, the FDIC will absorb most of the risk associated
with the commercial property loan losses which drove BNE into liquidation.
The FDIC will assume about Dollars 5.5bn of BNE's problem assets.
Fleet will also be able to turn any additional problem assets over to the
FDIC with minimal penalties until 1994.
Mr William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, yesterday said the agency plans to
borrow between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 5.5bn from the US Treasury's Federal
Financing Bank (FFB) as a result of resolving the BNE collapse.
This is the first time that the FDIC has taken advantage of changes last
year authorising it to borrow working capital from the FFB. Mr Seidman said
about Dollars 3bn will be repaid from the sale of assets and about Dollars
2bn will be losses.
The FDIC has taken great pains to stress KKR's distance from the deal. It
described KKR's involvement as 'a passive investor'. But this one of the
first times that a group which is not a bank has been allowed to make a
significant capital infusion into a leading US bank.
Under the terms of the Fleet deal, KKR investors will buy Dollars 283m of
dual convertible preferred stock. This will be convertible into 16.03m
common shares of Fleet/Norstar at Dollars 17.65 a share in no less than
three years. In addition, KKR has warrants to buy 6.5m Fleet common shares.
On a fully-diluted basis after Fleet's common offering, KKR's investors will
have about 16 per cent of Fleet's non-voting stock.
KKR said the firm was attracted to the BNE bid by the strength of
Fleet/Norstar's management. Fleet, which was founded 200 years ago and has
assets of Dollars 32.6bn excluding BNE, is considered one of the best-run
New England banks. The BNE acquisition will transform it into the region's
biggest player.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Cannon Street
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Market reaction to the Pounds 49m cash call from Cannon Street Investments
suggests the fashion for rights issues is getting out of hand. Cannon Street
is a deeply unsuccessful little conglomerate whose net assets have fallen by
60 per cent in the past two years and whose earnings per share fell 29 per
cent last year. Since 1986 it has raised Pounds 100m through share issues -
yesterday's not included - and has spent Pounds 130m on acquisitions. In the
past year, its borrowings have shot up from Pounds 29m to Pounds 107m. The
net result by yesterday morning was a market value of just Pounds 80m. Then
came the call, and the shares rose 17 per cent.
Part of the reason may be that some of the new paper has been conditionally
placed with the group's banker, Bank of Scotland. Should the issue flop, the
result will therefore be a partial swap of debt for equity. Cannon Street
and its chairman have been here before, when its collapse in the 1974
secondary banking crisis led to it being owned for a while by its then
banker, NatWest. But the banks' problems are their own affair. There seems
no reason for the equity market to throw good money after bad.

<TEXT>
The depressing thing about the latest news from Kleinwort Benson is the
insight it gives into the board's thinking. When the bank announced its
dreadful results last month, one extra item would not have greatly altered
their reception. But it chose to wait until the report and accounts to
disclose the embarrassing write-off of Dollars 23m of loans to an obscure US
partnership controlled by one of its directors. Perhaps more embarrassingly
again, it had to pay a further Dollars 2.4m to the partnership when the loan
agreement was terminated.
The really damning thing from the commercial banking point of view is that
that the failed company invested in such areas as Californian real estate.
Money was still being advanced last year when the US property market was in
full retreat. Shareholders might also usefully raise the question of why
Kleinwort signed a severance agreement forbidding it to sue for redress.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tarmac's share price ebbs and flows these days with hopes for the great
recovery. It is therefore not surprising that the market took fright
yesterday at the board's unexpectedly gloomy observations for the current
year, even if a 6 per cent fall to 229p looked a needlessly savage reaction.
However the numbers are added up, it is hard to see this year's dividend not
being fully covered; and when the tide finally turns Tarmac is bound to be a
major beneficiary.
The big worry at the moment is the performance of Tarmac America, which is
making a pitiful 4 per cent return on Dollars 1bn of capital employed. The
division managed just Pounds 5m of operating profits in the second half. The
deterioration in Florida and Virginia should have come as little surprise,
but one wonders whether the company should grasp the opportunity to shrink
the size of its US operation. Taking Pounds 100m of working capital out of
UK housing, by contrast, looks a little odd at such a low point in the
cycle, though the company insists it is not retreating from the business.
The trouble could be reaching the desired volume of 11,000 homes this year
without again resorting to discounts. Investors who have chased the shares
of the housebuilding contractors this year will no doubt take note.

long before the market begins to tire of it.
It may be, of course, that Taylor Woodrow is right in claiming that there
are excellent opportunities to be snapped up in commercial property and
housing. But if the bottom has been reached, shareholders are entitled to
ask why their investment is not being geared up with borrowed money. The
balance sheet may be a little less comfortable than at the end of last year,
but it is hardly strained.
The group can at least point to the fact that it has read the property
market shrewdly in the past couple of years. It went into the downturn with
most of its property let and - unlike several rivals - with little
development in progress. But shareholders who take up this issue will need
patience.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Beazer beats the retreat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,503.8 (+13.0)
The planned break-up of Beazer suggests that yet another grandiose folly of
the late 1980s is about to be disentangled the hard way. Shareholders are to
be offered shares in the original UK business, thereby being asked to pay
for their old company all over again. The rest - the grand global strategy
erected on the UK base - is implicitly worthless. Or perhaps not quite: if,
as Beazer suggests, the original business is worth Pounds 500m, the group's
present market capitalisation of Pounds 525m values the rest, including the
Dollars 1.7bn Koppers acquisition, at just Pounds 25m.
After the split, the old shares will consist of a half entitlement to the UK
business and a punt on Koppers' future. Since US ownership of Beazer is now
some 50 per cent and rising, it can be assumed that the company represented
by the old shares will end up US-owned and probably US-domiciled. The new
company will doubtless be UK-owned and eventually floated in its entirety.
Until more details are known, the whole can scarcely be valued. Much will
depend on whether the UK company will be independently run, rather than
subject to fresh empire-building by the old management. Even more will
depend on whether the flotation itself goes smoothly. The cash target of
Pounds 250m is ambitious, but may be essential in the context of net debt
still close to Pounds 800m. The snag is that the way things are going, by
the third quarter of the year new equity in UK construction companies could
be something of a glut on the market.

FT  24 APR 91 / Gorbachev faces test at party plenum
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOVIET President Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday met Mr Boris Yeltsin, the
Russian leader, for the first time since Mr Yeltsin announced his intention
to run for the presidency of Russia.
The meeting, at the end of two weeks in which both have been urged to
discuss forming a coalition government, came on the eve of what promises to
be the most severe test Mr Gorbachev has faced from within his Communist
party.
A plenum of the ruling central committee gathers in Moscow this afternoon
angry and despondent at Mr Gorbachev's handling of the economy. This mood
may prompt calls for his resignation from his party post as general
secretary.
Yesterday's meeting, on the outskirts of Moscow, was held under the
framework of the Federation Council and brought together leaders of the nine
Soviet republics prepared to discuss a union treaty.
Mr Yeltsin has in the past routinely delegated attendance at meetings of the
Federation Council to his senior deputy, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov.
His attendance, and the location of the meeting on neutral territory away
from the Kremlin, suggests an effort will be made to rebuild a bridge
between the two most powerful figures in a rapidly declining country.
An aide to the president said the subject of round-table talks as a prelude
to a coalition government would be mooted between the two leaders.
Deputies in the Supreme Soviet endorsed the anti-crisis programme introduced
in the on Monday by Mr Valentin Pavlov, the prime minister.
Their vote, by an overwhelming 323 to 13, followed a speech by Mr Pavlov in
which he called for a 'state of emergency' covering banks, tax collection,
transport and power supply.
He also revealed that a presidential decree had been prepared to index
incomes to a basket of commodities.
However, most economists - including those working on the programme -
believe it will fail unless agreement is reached between the main political
forces, and crucially the leaderships of the republics, on its shape and
implementation.
Workers in Minsk, the capital of Belorussia, left work again yesterday and
demonstrated in the city centre after the breakdown of talks with the
republican authorities which had temporarily ended a previous round of
strikes in the capital and elsewhere.
Elsewhere, the strike wave in the pits and other plants appeared to be
contracting.

<DATELINE>
   THOUSANDS of Names at Lloyd's
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the wealthy individuals who back underwriting at the London insurance market
 -are to be asked to provide about Pounds 100m in fresh funds to cover
asbestosis and pollution claims in the US.
Willis Faber &amp; Dumas (Agencies) is one of several members' agencies sending
letters to more than 3,000 Names on marine syndicates 406 and 448, advising
them of a sharp upward revision in estimated underwriting losses for the
1988 underwriting year.
Names on the two syndicates, two of the biggest in the Lloyd's market, could
face bills for at least Pounds 25,000 each.
There is growing concern in the market in particular about the impact of
claims arising from pollution in the US, to which a large number of the
market's syndicates could be exposed.
Lloyd's has been hit by a series of claims arising from long-tail US
liability business, in which claims can emerge many years after the policies
were originally written.
Hitherto most losses on US liability business have stemmed from asbestosis.
Now, however, the market is having to pay out for a growing number of
pollution cases, mainly reflecting the costs of cleaning up toxic waste on
the orders of the US government.
Mr John Rew, co-author of Chatset's Lloyd's League Tables, a market guide,
said yesterday: 'For a long time we've been warning about the dangers of US
long-tail liabilities. It's a treadmill for the Names.'
Mr Rew said that Chatset had revised its estimates of Lloyd's result for the
1988 year (to be published in July 1991) to an overall loss.
In the Willis letter, Mr James Sinclair, managing director of the agency,
said Willis had been 'shocked to learn' that the Wellington Underwriting
Agency, which manages syndicates 406 and 448, had revised their 'estimated
loss on both syndicates.'
A total of 3,022 Names on syndicate 406 will be asked to meet a cash call of
about Pounds 70m following losses recorded in the 1988 underwriting year.
3,808 Names on syndicate 448 will be asked to meet a loss of about Pounds
35m. Some members may be on both syndicates.
In February, Mr Sinclair had forecast losses of a little over half these
amounts.
Mr John Prentice, chairman of Wellington, said loss estimates had been
revised upwards following an acceleration of claims in the last few months
but the figures still had to be 'finalised.'
Although both syndicates 406 and 448 specialise in marine business, both
devote between 20 and 25 per cent of their underwriting capacity to
non-marine liability insurance.
Mr Sinclair said in his letter that 'these revised amounts do not reflect
any of the estimates we have been told by Wellington to date and there are a
significant number of questions we think will be needed to justify the
calculation.'
Willis Faber, now part of the international broker Willis Corroon, owned the
Wellington agency before divesting it under the terms of the 1982 Lloyd's
Act.

FT  24 APR 91 / Trade gap may be start of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S current account deficit widened last month, a sign that the
country's battered economy may soon begin a recovery.
The increase in the deficit, from Pounds 227m in February to Pounds 432m in
March, was announced yesterday by the Central Statistical Office. It was
caused largely by a 3 per cent increase in imports between February and
March, indicating renewed economic activity by Britain's consumers and
industrial groups.
Political opponents of the government seized on the increase in imports, to
Pounds 9.4bn last month, as signalling a structural weakness in the economy,
which may lead to a rapid growth in the import bill once demand improves.
According to this argument, Britain suffers from a lack of ability to meet
home demand by increasing domestic output rather than by buying goods from
overseas.
Mr Alex Carlile, the Liberal Democrats' trade and industry spokesman, said:
'After 12 years of Conservative economic policy, the fact that we still
cannot export more than we import ought to be worrying the government.' The
Labour party said the higher imports were linked to a weakening in Britain's
industrial capacity.
Last year, Britain cut its current account deficit to Pounds 12.8bn, from
Pounds 19.9bn in 1989, as the recession scaled back demand for overseas
goods. However, the pace of the improvement is clearly slowing.
The measure favoured by government statisticians as showing the underlying
trend - the value of visible trade, not counting oil and erratic items such
as aircraft, ships and gems - barely altered last month.
The deficit on this basis was Pounds 1.1bn in March, the same as in
February, and is the smallest number for four years. The comparable figure
in January was Pounds 1.2bn.
In terms of quarter-on-quarter statistics, the underlying deficit declined
by 7 per cent during the first three months of this year, compared to the
fourth quarter of 1990. Between the third and fourth quarters of 1990 the
fall was 22 per cent.
Mr Peter Spencer, chief UK economist at Shearson Lehman, a US-owned
investment house, said the trade figures were 'very disappointing, given the
weakness in the economy'.

FT  24 APR 91 / Lockheed wins Dollars 65bn fighter project: Consortium
secures first part of record Pentagon deal for new stealth aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by Lockheed yesterday won the contract for the next
generation of US stealth fighter aircraft, expected to be worth Dollars 65bn
(Pounds 38bn) over the next two decades - the biggest-ever aerospace
contract.
The Dollars 12.1bn first part of the contract, awarded by the Pentagon, is
for the development of the aircraft, of which 650 are planned to be built.
It was won in the face of fierce competition from a consortium led by
Northrop.
Lockheed's partners in the consortium for the advanced tactical fighter
(ATF), are Boeing and General Dynamics. Pratt &amp; Whitney, part of United
Technologies Corporation, will build the aircraft's engines.
Yesterday's announcement was a severe blow to Northrop and its partner
McDonnell Douglas, the largest defence contractor in the US. The two
companies had spent about Dollars 1bn and more than four years trying to
secure the contract.
McDonnell responded to the announcement by saying it would cut its workforce
by 500 by the end of the year. Northrop said it expected to shed 200 to 400
jobs soon.
Analysts believe the project may determine the future shape of the US
aerospace industry. It will consolidate Boeing and Lockheed's strong
position and is likely to boost the two companies' earnings.
Mr Gary Reich, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, has increased his
1992 earnings estimate for Lockheed by 25 cents a share to Dollars 5.40,
saying the contract should add 55 cents a share to net earnings in 1993.
Last night Mr Jerry King, Boeing executive vice-president, said the contract
would not result in significant earnings until the mid-1990s. Pratt &amp;
Whitney also cautioned that the contract would have no impact on its
production operations until the late 1990s.
General Dynamics estimated that its share of the revenues would total
Dollars 20bn over the programme's term.
The aircraft is to be a faster version of the F-15 Eagle fighters, and will
be capable of evading enemy radar.
Mr Donald Rice, the US air force secretary, said Lockheed and Boeing had
submitted the lowest bid. 'The ATF will balance stealth, supercruise and
advanced avionics in a highly manoeuvreable fighter that will ensure that
our pilots get first look and first kill,' said Mr Rice.
It would ensure American air superiority well into the next century, he
added.
The Pentagon's decision was the second blow this year for McDonnell Douglas,
which had to take a large write-off against fourth-quarter earnings after
the Pentagon decided in January to cancel its A-12 stealth attack aircraft
contract, a potential Dollars 50bn programme.
McDonnell Douglas has already started to wean itself of its dependence on
the Pentagon and has started to focus more on its commercial aircraft
operations.

FT  24 APR 91 / Prescription for a financial ailment: Market-based capital
requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL J COLLINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine gears clashing, the engine sputtering and the car stalling. That is
the picture some observers paint of the credit crunch and its impact on the
US economy. 'Get credit flowing again,' would seem the remedy. If bank
capital requirements stand in the way, reduce them, so that banks can lend
again.
Such a prescription makes no sense. It is the wrong response to the wrong
issue. Less capital is not better. Nor is more capital. What is needed is a
franchise that will improve banks' ability to attract capital and capital
requirements that are market-based.
The so-called credit crunch is no reason to reduce bank capital
requirements. Borrowers with the same prospective cash flows and financial
ratios as a year ago are getting credit, either from banks or in the capital
markets. For them there is no credit crunch.
The problem is that borrowers by and large do not have the same financial
ratios as they did a year ago. The recession has reduced their cash flows.
Consequently, the risk of lending has increased. Companies rated A a year
ago and B today are finding it difficult to obtain the same amount of credit
at the same rate as they did a year ago. This may be a 'credit crunch', but,
if so, it is more a symptom than a cause of the recession. To imply that
banks should be supplying credit to such borrowers as if nothing had changed
is in effect a recommendation that banks should be less prudent. That is
unlikely to do either the economy or the banking system any good.
The remedy for recession lies elsewhere. Political uncertainty contributed
to the downturn; its removal via the swift victory in the Gulf will
contribute to the upturn. Further stimulus has come through monetary and
fiscal policy. Most forecasters now expect the recession to end sometime
this year. This should spell the end of the credit crunch.
To perform their function as financial intermediaries banks need a franchise
that will attract capital. Such a franchise would allow banks to branch
freely and to offer customers a full range of financial services, including
securities and insurance as well as deposit-taking and lending. This allows
banks to diversify their sources of income, to make more efficient use of
their distribution systems and to realise economies of scale. The EC has
given its banks such a franchise through the Second Banking Directive. The
US and Japan are lagging behind, although adoption of the recent US Treasury
proposal would help close that gap.
The purpose of bank capital requirements is to limit the risk that a bank
will fail. To do so efficiently such requirements should be market-based.
This means putting investors in debt of banks (and of companies, such as
Citicorp, that own banks) at risk so that they will exercise market
discipline over the bank, and it means relating required capital ratios to
the market risks a bank assumes.
If investors in a company's debt believe that they are at risk when the
organisation becomes illiquid or insolvent, they will effectively control
the level of capital that the organisation must maintain. As the perceived
level of risk increases, such investors generally (and quickly) reduce the
amount of funds that they are willing to provide and/or demand an increase
in the rate of return. To counteract this the company must take steps to
improve its equity ratios.
Citicorp's own experience is a case in point. During the past year investors
and rating agencies perceived that the risk of Citicorp paper had increased.
As a result, Citicorp had to pay higher rates for certain types of funding
and it encountered some difficulty in placing as much paper as it would have
liked. We responded by initiating a programme to increase our total capital
by Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn over the next three years. The first tranche
of the capital increase has come through the issuance of Dollars 1.25bn in
convertible preferred stock. A second tranche will come through the sale of
non-strategic businesses. The rest should come through retained earnings; to
this end we aim to pare costs by Dollars 1.5bn a year while retaining our
revenue momentum. With tight control over asset growth, this
capital-building programme will improve Citicorp's capital ratios.
In designing capital regulation, policymakers should preserve such market
discipline. This entails limiting the guarantees that the government
provides to depositors or creditors of banks and companies that own banks.
Fortunately, both the US and the EC seem ready to do so. The US is
discussing ways to limit insurance of bank deposits, and the EC seems
determined to keep coverage low.
However, limiting guarantees is only the first step. Capital requirements
should be imposed on the bank (but not on companies that own banks) and
these requirements should be related to the bank's exposure to market risks,
such as interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and credit risk. The bank's
exposure to each risk is its net position (after due allowance for netting,
hedging and diversification) times the likely movement in the risk factor,
such as the level of interest rates. The bank's overall capital requirement
would be the sum of the requirements for each risk, minus an allowance for
the fact that some risks (such as interest and exchange rate risk) may
themselves be negatively correlated.
Elements of this market-based approach are present in the EC's proposed
Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD). This directive would apply to non-bank
investment firms and to the trading book of banks. For the bank's trading
book, the CAD would replace the 8 per cent Basle ratio with separate
requirements for credit risk, interest rate risk and exchange rate risk. The
CAD holds the promise of establishing a capital regime that will protect
both bank and non-bank investment firms while creating a level playing field
on which the two would compete.
In sum, the credit crunch will pass. Bank regulators need not act. But they
must act to give banks a franchise that will attract capital. And they must
act to make capital requirements market-based.

FT  24 APR 91 / East Europe should learn from Asia: From central planning to
a market economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By S STANLEY KATZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East European countries engaged in the heroic change-over from
centrally-planned to market-driven economic systems have been getting most
of their advice from the west. They would do well to look to Asia as well.
Advice to eastern Europe from western experts largely follows classical
economic lines: free prices, remove subsidies, open your economies to
international trade, make your currencies freely convertible, privatise the
state-owned companies, invite foreign investment, close inefficient plants
and retire redundant workers. This, the experts acknowledge, will involve
some costs - higher prices, unemployment, lost income, and more foreign debt
and servicing. But these are short-term and will be more than offset by the
longer-term benefits that accrue from free markets. They urge, therefore,
that their recommended reform package be adopted quickly and in full, while
supporters of economic change still hold the high ground.
Initially, east Europe's economic reformers assumed that advice about
markets from advisers schooled in market economies could not be wrong. More
recently, however, the first rush of enthusiasm for a cold-turkey approach
to reform is fading. Euphoria over economic emancipation is giving way to a
more hard-headed assessment of the people and institutional deficits that
will have to be cleared before eastern Europe's economies can survive - much
less compete - in a free-market world.
The deficits are formidable: most of the basic skills and institutions
needed to make a system work - double-entry book-keeping, personal property
rights and a commercial banking system, to name a few - do not exist.
Industrial equipment and technology are, by western standards, obsolete. Few
companies can estimate their net worth or unit production costs, or judge
what they could produce competitively - information all serious foreign
investors would insist on. Arching over these deficits are the problems of
severe environmental degradation, long-neglected infrastructure and the
virtual disappearance of the region's pre-war ethic.
Increased awareness of their economies' internal weaknesses, together with
doubts about continued public support for a reform process that involves
hardships of unknown magnitude and unpredictable duration, are raising
second thoughts among eastern Europe's leaders about the wisdom of exposing
their still-fragile democracies to what amounts to an economic free-fall.
Other factors have surfaced as well that reinforce the need for a second
look. The recent rout of agricultural subsidies by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and the continuing row between the US and Japan over
market access, for example, suggest that the free-market approach
recommended for eastern Europe is honoured as much in the breach as in the
observance by the market-oriented countries of the west.
A further discovery is that the path to the market being urged on east
European countries is substantially different to that taken by countries
that have most recently successfully navigated the course from economic
backwardness to world-class competitors. These, of course, are Asia's Newly
Industrialised Countries (NICs): Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
Many cultural, political and social differences separate east Europe from
east Asia, and comparisons should not be pushed too far. But in terms of how
to go about transforming a backward economy into an efficient, competitive
one, there is much common ground and many lessons to be shared. A few
examples of the differences in the approach recommended to eastern Europe
and the way that NICs, and earlier, Japan, went about the work of economic
reform and restructuring are perhaps instructive:
Industrial strategy and support: Neither Asia's NICs nor Japan entrusted to
the market, or to foreign investors, responsibility for deciding which of
their industries would prosper and which would fail. On the contrary, they
formulated industrial strategies based on forecasts of market developments
and assessments of which of their 'neo-infant industries' could be expected
to carve out a competitive niche in world markets and which could not. For
the first group, they provided protection from import competition as well as
export incentives, tax relief and other financial help to bolster their
growth and competitiveness.
To ensure that the beneficiary industries would not become
protection-dependent and would become internationally competitive over time,
fiscal support was provided on a declining scale. At the same time,
companies in uncompetitive or declining industries were helped to diversify
or phase out, and workers retrained.
Eastern Europe, after 40 years of disastrous economic planning,
understandably eschews all forms of central planning, including Asia's
market-directed, indicative type. The same attitudes carry over to the
question of transitional help for industries trying to adapt to market
forces. While these attitudes are consistent with a free-market philosophy,
Asia's less doctrinaire approach might save some east European companies
that with reasonable transitional support could adjust to a market
environment, but without it would likely go under - taking jobs and income
with them.
Exchange rates: Asian countries have used exchange rates as an important
tool of economic policy. As typified by Korea and Taiwan, exchange rates
were set to encourage exports and savings and discourage imports. Only after
exports had penetrated big overseas markets - and they had amassed large
reserves in the process - did these countries agree (reluctantly) to a
revaluation of their currencies.
East European countries are being advised to do the opposite: let the market
determine the volumes of imports and exports and, by default, set the
market-clearing exchange rate.
Foreign investment: Japan earlier, and the NICs more recently, have acquired
much of their technology through licences, franchises, market-sharing
arrangements and reverse engineering (Asian for 'pirating'). They wanted
knowledge and technology, not foreign partners, and foreign equity
investment was (and is) not actively encouraged. During Japan's first period
of modernisation in the 1860s, Japan imported European bankers - but not
their banks - to help create a domestic banking system. When enough Japanese
had learned to be bankers, the foreign advisers were sent home. The NICs
have adopted an essentially similar technique. Price liberalisation and
subsidies: Prices in Asia's NICs are nominally set by market forces. But key
prices may be adjusted further by fiscal means (tax rebates, tariffs,
duties, subsidies) to ensure that the buy/sell, save/invest signals they
emit conform to national priorities: high savings and investment rates,
aggressive exporting and relative self-sufficiency in food. It is
incongruous that while east European countries are being urged to let market
forces determine their domestic prices, there is no market price for
imported rice in Japan - because there is no imported rice; and agricultural
prices in the US and Europe are influenced as much by national budgets as by
market forces.
A final consideration. It is axiomatic that public support for economic
reform is inversely proportionate to the distress it causes. Common to both
Asia's and eastern Europe's economic restructuring efforts is the need to
enlist and maintain public support for the reform process. Asia's NICs have
demonstrated that it is possible to achieve market-driven economic
restructuring without incurring unacceptably high economic and social costs.
Eastern Europe's economic reformers might find it rewarding to take a closer
look at Asia's experience.

FT  24 APR 91 / Leading Article: Rebuilding South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LINK between South Africa's efforts to negotiate a post-apartheid
constitution and the state of the country's economy is becoming increasingly
important. The process of fundamental political reform is difficult enough
at the best of times. It is especially hazardous when times are hard.
Now that the irreversibility of change in South Africa is so clearly
apparent, the least western governments can do to improve the economic
climate is to hasten the end of remaining sanctions. And the African
National Congress, still fighting a last-ditch battle against repeal, should
instead acknowledge that sanctions have achieved their purpose, declare
victory and withdraw.
As President F. W. de Klerk has pointed out during his visit to London, the
combination of population growth of 2.6 per cent a year, and an average
annual growth rate over the last decade of 1.6 per cent, makes a grim
backdrop to the constitutional process now under way in South Africa.
There is a danger that this process can be derailed by the violence that
wracks the country; and while political tensions are at the heart of the
fighting, there is little doubt that these tensions are exacerbated by
poverty and rising unemployment.
Mr de Klerk is thus right to argue that economic growth and constitutional
reform have to be mutually reinforcing. The lifting of sanctions combined
with new investment is an essential condition to South Africa's economic
recovery, which in turn is critical to growth in the whole region.
Conflicting signals
Unfortunately there continue to be conflicting signals from South Africa. Mr
Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, due in
London today, can be expected to persist in the ANC's view that it is too
soon to lift trade and other embargoes against Pretoria, arguing that
continued outside pressure is needed if Mr de Klerk is to fulfil his pledge
to create a non-racial South Africa.
This argument held good until Mr de Klerk so convincingly demonstrated his
commitment to reform. But by the end of June the last pillars of apartheid
will have been repealed - the Group Areas Act, the Land Acts, and the racial
provisions of the Population Registration Act.
Even if the government wanted to, it could not now rebuild apartheid. The
internal pressures that brought about the system's demise - demographic
changes, the growth of black trade unions, the increasing importance of
black consumers, shortages of white skilled manpower - are as powerful as
ever.
Meanwhile the new constitution for South Africa is slowly starting to take
shape. The ANC's draft constitutional principles, published earlier this
month, revealed encouraging common ground with Pretoria. Both parties
propose a bill of rights, proportional representation, and a bi-cameral
assembly.
Sticking points
On the face of it, the ANC demand that the constitution be drawn up by a
constituent assembly, and its call for an interim government, are sticking
points in the transition process. But there are signs that a compromise may
be possible. Pretoria has indicated that once the multi-party conference,
expected to convene later this year, has reached agreement on the principles
of the new constitution, they could be placed before a multi-party
conference instead of a constituent assembly.
And yesterday in London Mr de Klerk went some way towards meeting the ANC's
call for an interim government, offering all main political leaders 'a voice
in the formulation of important policy decisions' during the period leading
to a new constitution.
These developments should encourage the business community whose support Mr
de Klerk has been seeking during his visit to London. Of course, Mr de Klerk
must convince would-be investors that the violence that continues to scar
the country will soon be brought to an end. But they can play an important
part in bringing this about by taking an important role in the building of a
new South Africa.

What on earth is the world coming to? Britain's Inland Revenue seems to have
lost faith in the integrity of the Royal Mail. The powers that be at
Somerset House have felt it necessary to issue Form CPS1 on the security of
cheque payments, which is an effective vote of no confidence in Britain's
postal system.
The Revenue notes that cheques sent by post may be stolen 'before they reach
us'. It recommends tax payers to use the bank giro, electronic funds
transfer, or pay by cash at the local Post Office. If you do insist on
sending a cheque in the post, and it is lost, you may become involved in
lengthy inquiries.
Next excuse, please.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson must be ruing the day it ever heard of Kenneth McCormick
and Ojai. Until a year or so ago, McCormick was one of the darlings of the
Kleinwort Group and Ojai (pronounced O-hi) was best known as a Californian
shangri-la - a small town with just one traffic light and a music festival.
An American banker who rose fast up the swinging Californian banking tree,
McCormick became treasurer of First Interstate of Los Angeles while only
just into his 30s. There he became adept at the swaps business, and was
hired by Kleinwort to set up and run their fledgling US swaps operation in
1985.
A tall, soft-spoken man with a sharp eye for the market, he quickly turned
it into a success. The business flourished, earning Kleinwort several
million dollars a year. But like many Californians, McCormick was also
interested in the venture capital business, and
persuaded Kleinwort to help finance a new investment vehicle, Ojai Capital,
which would specialise in funding business start-ups and real estate
projects.
At the time, Kleinwort said the financing 'had been negotiated on an arm's
length basis' and it considered the transaction 'to be in the best interests
of the group and its share-
holders.' Some Dollars 23m later, McCormick is out of the door with a
promise that Kleinwort will not try to sue him.
It all smacks yet again of a fringe player trying to buy into a market it
should never have got into in the first place.

Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank and host for yesterday's Wincott
financial journalism awards, hates gossip. Which is all very sad, since if
Sir Jeremy, fellow of All Souls, were ever to put pen to public paper he
would be able to shed more light on the City than most of the distinguished
Wincott award winners over the years.
But Sir Jeremy, who has headed Lloyds since 1977, is one of the old school
of bankers who believes in reticence. He learnt his trade at the nod and
wink school of Glyn, Mills &amp; Co where no one ever seemed to write notes. He
remembers being taken to see Lord Hampden at Lazards where nothing of
consequence was talked about. Hence, he was quite surprised when his
colleague turned to him after the meeting and said it had been 'extremely
useful'.
Increasing openness in the City, he said, had led to loss of status by the
Bank of England compared with the Treasury, because in the old days the Bank
had been able to give the impression that it knew an awful lot of important
things that it could not possibly discuss. Perhaps this had something to do
with the Bank having Reuters screens before the Treasury.
All this has changed with the rapid growth in financial journalism and Sir
Jeremy was surprisingly complimentary about the contribution of the fourth
estate. But then you can afford to be when you know an awful lot more
secrets than the media.

South Africa's President F. W. de Klerk may make many boasts about his
country. But one thing that should bother him is the surprisingly large
numbers of ex-South Africans now holding positions of influence and power in
the City of London.
Their loss to South Africa represents a time bomb that won't be defused
until it properly develops the talents of its majority population. Its 5m
whites compare with Australia's 17m and Canada's 25m. Yet neither of the
other two anywhere near match South Africa in supplying UK institutions with
senior abilities.
Besides the famous Sir Michael Edwardes, they include Sir Sydney Lipworth
(chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission) and Sir Mark Weinberg
(former chairman of Allied Dunbar). The latter pair, both lawyers, are old
boys of Johannesburg's King Edward VII school.
Among the next generation are Eurotunnel's Sir Alastair Morton, Morgan
Grenfell's chairman John Craven, and Schroders' Win Bischoff.
If one counts Zimbabweans as well, there is Andrew Tuckey, chairman of
Baring Brothers. Simon, his elder brother is a QC and chairman of the the
review panel of the financial reporting council, and younger brother James,
is managing director of MEPC.
There are numerous reasons, political besides financial, why such people
come to the City. But why South Africans make better businessmen than
Canadians or Australians would call for a doctoral thesis.

FT  24 APR 91 / Made in Britain, Japanese-style: Car manufacturing in the UK
is still set to expand, despite the immediate problems of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1990s was supposed to be the decade of opportunity for the motor
industry in Britain. But as one crisis meeting succeeds another this week,
one could be forgiven for thinking that the industry is slipping back into
the dark days of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The chief executives of Rover, Ford of Britain, Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot
troop into the Treasury today to tell Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of
their deep concern at what they see as an attack on car manufacturing in
last month's Budget.
Tomorrow union leaders have been called to talks with Mr Albert Caspers,
Ford of Europe's director for manufacturing operations, amid speculation -
strenuously denied by Ford itself - that the future of the US car maker's
British assembly plants at Halewood, Merseyside and Dagenham in Essex, is
again in doubt.
Yet the paradoxical fact is that more car assembly capacity is under
construction in Britain than anywhere else in Europe. By the mid-1990s
output is forecast to be more than double the crisis level of the early
1980s. As the Japanese car makers march in, component suppliers that have
previously shunned manufacturing in the UK are buzzing towards the
honey-pot.
The script looked promising, but for the moment the plot appears to be going
badly awry.
After five successive record years from 1985 to 1989 UK new car sales have
fallen ominously. Registrations last year were down by 12.7 per cent -
admittedly from a record level - and have plunged by a further 21.6 per cent
in the first quarter.
Highly indebted car dealers - reputable groups as well as fringe operators -
are collapsing into receivership and liquidation in worrying numbers.
Leading component makers are suffering sharply falling profits and
workforces are being cut. 'The current climate is hostile and in many of our
markets customer demand is erratic and uncertain,' says Mr Colin Hope,
chairman of T&amp;N, a leading UK auto components maker.
Truck sales are only half the level of two years ago and the slide into
recession is sharper than any UK truck maker can remember in the post-war
period. 'Heaven only knows how some manufacturers are surviving,' says Mr
Peter Foden, chairman of ERF, the last publicly-quoted, independent UK truck
maker. Most UK truck makers are running up big losses, and short-time
working and redundancies have been the order of the day for more than a
year.
Against a background of such immediate traumas Mr Derek Barron, chairman of
Ford of Britain and president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, Mr George Simpson, chief executive of Rover, Mr Paul Tosch,
chairman of Vauxhall, and Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director of Peugeot
Talbot, will seek to convince the chancellor that he has kicked the industry
when it was already down.
As the economic cycle turned down, they had been looking to the government
for support and encouragement in the attempt to make the industry a driving
force again in the UK economy. Instead, in a Budget principally designed to
extricate the government from the poll tax debacle, the industry was hit by
higher value added tax - but no relief in the discriminatory special car tax
 -fuel tax increases and scale charge increases for company car benefits
above the level of inflation, and the imposition on employers of national
insurance contributions on company cars.
The motor industry worries that the government is looking to it for a quick
fiscal fix. Memories run deep of the 1950s and 1960s, when the government
sought to regulate the economy in part through car hire purchase controls.
'The industry wants reassurance that this is not the beginning of it being
used again as an economic regulator,' says Professor Garel Rhys, professor
of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School and adviser to the
Commons trade and industry select committee.
Above all the car makers are seeking a cut in the 10 per cent rate of
special car tax. The industry argues that no other leading vehicle producing
country in Europe singles out cars for such a discriminatory levy as the
special car tax.
This year is probably already a lost cause for the industry - the latest
forecasts suggest car sales will struggle to exceed 1.6m-1.7m units and
truck sales could hit the lowest level for decades.
Nevertheless, the worst fears of the industry chiefs may well turn out to be
only short-term; Britain could still prove to be one of the strongest growth
areas of the 1990s in the world auto industry.
The current recession is certainly causing painful job losses beyond the
labour force reductions of an industry seeking greater productivity and
efficiency. But the deepest and most painful restructuring moves were
already achieved in the 1980s.
A report by the Institute of Manpower Studies showed that from 1980 to 1987
the UK vehicles and parts industry had shed 185,000 jobs, or 45 per cent of
the workforce at the start of the decade. In the same period labour
productivity rose 66 per cent.
Profits certainly fell last year at Vauxhall, Peugeot Talbot and Rover. At
Ford of Britain, they fell sharply: the company was hit by industrial action
last year and is now also carrying the heavy losses of Jaguar, the UK luxury
car maker it acquired at the end of 1989. But that is a far cry from the sea
of red ink in which the industry fought to stay afloat a decade ago. It is
altogether leaner and fitter now.
'The UK is probably top middle in productivity in Europe,' says Prof Rhys,
'way behind Germany, probably behind Spain, but perhaps ahead of France. But
what saves the UK is its relatively low wages. With middling productivity
and the lowest wages, the UK has one of the best cost bases in Europe.'
Wage costs in the UK motor industry last year were the lowest among all the
world's leading automobile-producing countries, according to statistics
compiled by the German Automobile Industry Federation (VDA).
Some assembly capacity in the UK still has to be closed - most notably part
of Rover's Cowley, Oxford plant - but the accent in the 1990s, at least in
the car and components sectors, should be firmly on expansion. According to
Prof Rhys an optimistic forecast would suggest a leap in UK car assembly
capacity from 1.7m in 1989 to 2.7m-2.8m by the end of the decade.
It is the motor industry in Britain that will be growing, however, not the
British motor industry. In terms of ownership precious little of the latter
remains. What is transforming the sector's prospects is the wave of inward
investment by Japanese car makers into the UK.
The decisions by Nissan, Toyota and Honda to begin car production in the UK
appear to guarantee that output in the second half of the 1990s will exceed
2m cars a year, more than double the level of the first half of the 1980s,
and the build-up of production promises eventual relief for the sector's
chronic trade deficit.
To Mr Jacques Calvet, chief executive of France's Peugeot group and
philosopher-king of the lobby to restrict Japanese car sales in Europe, the
UK is fast becoming a 'Japanese aircraft carrier off the coast of Europe,'
and 'Japan's fifth-largest island'.
The alarming trend of UK car sales, imports and production in the 1970s and
1980s explains at a glance, however, why the government has welcomed
Japanese car makers to Britain so enthusiastically.
Since 1983 the UK balance of payments has shown a deficit on manufactured
goods - and the motor industry has played a key role in the slump. The motor
industry trade balance has deteriorated sharply since the end of the 1970s
and been firmly in deficit since 1982. In recent years it has accounted for
close to a third of the total UK visible trade deficit.
The first relief came last year, as the deficit fell to Pounds 4.6bn from
Pounds 6.6bn in 1989. The biggest factor in the improvement was the impact
of the recession, however, which cut imports as new car sales fell.
Now there are also the first signs of structural improvement, as UK car
exports begin to grow appreciably. Export programmes by Vauxhall, Ford and
Peugeot have been important. But for the first time exports by Nissan are
also having a significant impact and this year Nissan begins to export cars
to Japan from the UK.
The drama of the fluctuations in the fortunes of motor manufacturing in the
UK can hardly be overstated.
From the early 1930s to 1955 the UK had Europe's largest motor industry. It
is currently ninth in the world production league and fifth in Europe behind
West Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
In 1968 when the UK-owned industry combined its forces to form the British
Leyland Motor Corporation, the company accounted for 40 per cent of UK new
car registrations. Today the rump company that remains from British Leyland,
Rover Group, is 20 per cent owned by Honda of Japan, and last year it held
14 per cent of UK new car sales.
Compare that with the rise of the Japanese. Back in 1952 Nissan was
producing Austin cars in Japan under licence from Austin Motor, and Honda
did not even market its first car until 1963. It now appears a racing
certainty that by the second half of the 1990s Japanese car makers will
account directly for about a third of UK car production of about 2m units a
year.
Another third may be European-owned with Peugeot of France producing at
Ryton, Coventry, possibly with an enhanced capacity, and Rover Group at
least nominally UK-owned. Rover is already importantly dependent on Honda
technology, however, in addition to its minority ownership.
The remaining third of the UK car production base will be US-owned, with
Ford also controlling Jaguar and Aston Martin and General Motors (Vauxhall),
Lotus.
With total planned investments of more than Pounds 1.8bn the Japanese are
now committed to closing the yawning gap between UK car production of 1.296m
last year and domestic car sales of 2.009m:
Nissan will build more than 200,000 cars a year at its Pounds 700m
Sunderland plant by 1992-93. Output totalled 76,000 last year and is
expected to reach 120,000 this year with 80 per cent earmarked for export.
Nissan is also investing in UK R&amp;D facilities.
Toyota is committed to building 100,000 cars a year by late 1995 rising to
200,000 cars a year by 1997-98 at Burnaston, near Derby, but this timetable
could well be brought forward. It is investing Pounds 840m in car assembly
and engine plants.
Honda is committed to building 100,000 cars a year by 1994 at its Pounds
350m Swindon assembly and engine plant. Rover is producing up to 40,000
Honda Concertos a year at its Longbridge Birmingham plant.
Nissan has indicated its ambition to expand to a capacity of 400,000 cars a
year by the late 1990s, and both Toyota and Honda are expected to expand
significantly beyond their present publicly declared targets.
The next time a chancellor attacks the UK motor industry, the deputation on
his doorstep may well include Nissan, Toyota and Honda as well as Ford,
Vauxhall, Rover and Peugeot.

FT  24 APR 91 / Leading Article: New tax for councils
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS difficult to forgive the government for being engaged in a second
complete overhaul of local authority finance almost 12 years after coming
into power. It is not difficult to understand, however, since it made an
appalling mess of the first attempt. The question is whether the second one
is any better. The answer is 'yes', but only within the limited terms of
reference that the government has set for itself.
Bryan Gould, shadow secretary of state for the environment, complains that
the government still cannot say 'sorry'. He is a little unfair. There in the
consultative document on the new council tax is an apology, albeit a limp
one, for the community charge: 'the public', it admits, 'have not been
persuaded that the scheme is fair.' There, too, can be found something more
startling still, an apology from the Treasury: 'The government', it
acknowledges, 'considered the relative shares of local expenditure financed
from local and central sources, and concluded that the burden on the local
element had become too great.' How much more glasnost can you hope for, Mr
Gould?
The proposal on local taxation looks like a final plan in consultative
clothing. The principal question, therefore, is whether it is a reasonable
one, or at least better than either the community charge or the old rates.
It looks as though it is.
Sensible features
Each property is to be allocated to one of seven broad tax bands, with
houses and flats being placed in a band, according to how their value
relates to the average for all properties in England, Scotland and Wales.
Furthermore, 'couples living in properties in the same band anywhere in each
country will face the same council tax bill (before any rebates or
discounts) if their authorities spend at the standard level'. Both features
look sensible.
The detail of the proposed tax is subject to two main criticisms: first,
that increases in tax bills are not proportionate to increases in the value
of the properties; second, that it retains the head tax element, in the form
of the 25 per cent personal discount for single adult households. But once
one has abandoned the myth that each individual adult must receive an
individual bill, for the sake of accountability, the latter element is
hardly defensible. If broadly based discounts are to be given, it would be
better to relate them to other household characteristics, such as whether or
not it contains pensioners or dependent children.
Nevertheless, this is not a bad tax, as domestic property taxes go. The
fundamental objection is that it does not go far enough. This is to be the
only tax local authorities are allowed to set and is to cover a mere 15 per
cent of local authority current spending. Given this degree of gearing, the
power to cap will be used extensively. Local authorities are to remain the
government's poodles. They can bark, but only softly.
Attractive concept
This point is underlined by the consultative document on the structure of
local government. It starts from the assumption that local authorities have
little choice about what they are to do. 'The government is committed', it
declaims, 'to develop the concept of enabling authorities.' The concept is
attractive, but the lack of choice for local communities themselves is not.
Equally unattractive must be the planning blight that will now afflict much
of local government, as the Local Government Commission wends its weary way
through the structure of local government, area by area.
These proposals are, as everyone knows, about getting the government out of
a hole that it dug for itself. Whether they can do so will become somewhat
clearer after next week's local elections. The government is certainly in
better shape on the issue than it was. While the poll tax will be around at
least until 1993, the levels will be lower and a less unacceptable
replacement will be on the way. Perhaps it has even escaped the political
problem of its own making. If so, this is not because it deserves to, but
because a year is a long time in politics.

FT  24 APR 91 / North expected to recover soonest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORTH of England, the last UK region to go into recession, is likely to
be the first to come out of it, according to a survey of the region's
first-quarter industrial and commercial performance published yesterday.
That would reverse previous experience, when the region - which comprises
the north-east and Cumbria for government statistical purposes - was always
'first in, last out' when the national economic cycle turned downwards.
The survey of 800 manufacturing and service companies was carried out by
local chambers of commerce and the Northern Development Company, the
regional agency supported by government, local authorities and the private
sector.
It found that exports held up 'encouragingly well' in the first quarter.
Although unemployment increased, the situation was expected to stabilise
before July. The longer view of profits and turnover was encouraging.
The change reflects the reconstruction of the regional economy since the
early 1980s. In the 1980-82 recession, the north-east in particular suffered
because a third of its workforce was in coal, steel or shipbuilding, which
were immediately affected when demand fell in the south.
Only 3 per cent of the workforce is now in those traditional industries and
the economy is widely based, as well as having many more smaller and
medium-sized businesses with which to absorb the shock of a downturn.
The north-west chambers of commerce economic survey of the first quarter is
more cautious about recovery.
Loss of staff from computing services companies is slowing, suggesting that
the UK recession may be starting to bottom out. Figures for the first
quarter of the year collated by the Computing Services Association indicate
that for the first time since 1989 the rate of change of staff numbers has
not worsened.

FT  24 APR 91 / Further increase in pupils attending independent schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of pupils at independent schools has risen for the eighth
successive year, according to this year's annual report from the Independent
Schools Information Service (ISIS), Andrew Adonis writes.
Some 476,448 pupils, 7.4 per cent of all school children, currently attend
1,372 independent schools. That is up from 6.3 per cent in 1983. The number
of boarders has fallen sharply, however, down some 4 per cent on last year.
The number of secondary-age pupils has fallen slightly since last year but
there has been strong growth at the other end of the spectrum. The number of
three-year-olds in private schools is up by 7.6 per cent on last year.
Pupils aged four are up by 5.4 per cent and those aged five to 11 up by 1.8
per cent. The number of boarders fell sharply, down 4 per cent on last year.
School fees have risen by an average of 12.5 per cent over the last year.
They now average Pounds 3,594 for day pupils and Pounds 6,672 for boarders.
One in four of all pupils receives financial help with fees, mostly from the
schools themselves. The government is to spend Pounds 100,000 on a work
experience scheme for students considering a teaching career. After a pilot
project last year Mr Michael Fallon, the schools minister, announced that
400 places will be available for a similar scheme this autumn. Government
proposals issued yesterday giving parents a say in the appraisal of
teachers' performance were immediately attacked by the second largest
teachers union as opening the system to influence from parental 'gossip and
tittle-tattle'.

FT  24 APR 91 / Audit Office faults NHS local autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Health Service's Pounds 4bn-a-year supplies operation could
benefit from management techniques used by companies such as Boots and Marks
and Spencer, the National Audit Office says today.
An NAO study of the management of complex operations in private-sector
companies showed that the NHS's approach differed 'in nearly every respect'.
In particular, the report says, none of 16 private companies surveyed
'permitted local autonomy on the scale allowed throughout the NHS'.
The report's conclusion - that decentralised structures have prevented the
NHS from maximising its purchasing efficiency - comes when the government's
health reforms are encouraging still more local autonomy in many areas of

FT  24 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): British Rail faces increased threat of
industrial action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE likelihood of industrial action ballots among 95,000 British Rail
workers grew last night after BR said it had made a final 7 per cent pay
offer.
After meeting to consider the BR offer last night, union leaders said they
would not recommend the executives of their unions to accept it, but would
consider later this week what action to take.
The move came as separate talks to avert threats of industrial action by
76,000 workers in the electricity supply industry were continuing. Late last
night the employers raised their pay offer by 0.5 percentage point to 8.5
per cent, which the unions are understood to have rejected. Electricity
unions had threatened an overtime ban from midnight tonight unless the offer
was increased substantially. Action by either the rail or power unions could
cause considerable disruption.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the BR offer 'seems
unacceptable'. Leaders of the RMT transport union are believed to be more
likely to call an industrial action ballot. Leaders of the Aslef drivers'
union may take the issue to the Railway Staffs National Tribunal for
arbitration instead.
BR made only a small improvement to an earlier 6.5 per cent pay offer, in
spite of warnings by union leaders that a vote on industrial action was
likely unless they were offered a rise above the rate of inflation. Unions
were meeting last night to consider a formal response.
The offer would cover 95,000 employees, represented by the RMT, TSSA and
Aslef transport unions, and would add Pounds 106m to BR's wages bill. It
would probably be extended to cover another 20,000 employees not directly
represented at yesterday's talks.
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's employee relations director, said he believed 7 per
cent was a good offer because it would be above the rate of inflation for
the year it covered. He said that to have offered more would have been
irresponsible.
Mr Watkinson said the deterioration in BR's finances this year, because of
the recession, meant a higher offer would lead to cuts in services or jobs.
Unions were told during the talks in London that BR faced the most severe
financial difficulties for a generation. Revenue for 1991 was running 9 per
cent below the expected level and profits from property sales had fallen
sharply.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Promise by Labour on 'green rights'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR government would give employees 'green rights' in the workplace, Mr
Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, has told trade unionists. The
rights would include access to information and time off for training in
environmental matters.
The pledge comes as unions, employers and the government prepare to discuss
the environment at a National Economic Development Council meeting next
month. The Trades Union Congress will present proposals for a full range of
environmental rights for unions.
The proposals are likely to be strongly opposed by the Confederation of
British Industry, which favours a voluntary approach.
Employees should have access to information on environmental hazards and the
right to seek independent advice, Mr Gould told a union-organised conference
on the environment.
He said: 'Trade union representatives should have the right for time off to
receive training in environmental matters. They should have the right to
call in independent watchdogs such as the Environmental Protection Executive
(the new agency proposed by Labour) if they are unhappy about a plant or
process. Whistle-blowers should not be victimised.'
Mr Gould also backed a National Communication Union proposal for an
environmental equivalent of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health
regulations.
The TUC will put forward its own 'green rights' plan at the NEDC meeting on
May 20. It is due to be attended by Mr Michael Heseltine, environment
secretary.
The proposals conform broadly with Labour's but add the right to negotiate
changes in production and work organisation and the right 'without
recrimination' to refuse to undertake work with potentially harmful
environmental effects.

MR GERALD RATNER, the chief of Britain's biggest retail jeweller yesterday
gave the secret of his company's success - it sells 'total crap'.
Mr Ratner, chairman and managing director of Ratners told the Institute of

He added: 'We also do cut glass sherry decanters complete with six glasses

Pounds 4.95.
'People say how can you sell this for such a low price. I say because it is

On Monday Ratners announced annual pre-tax profits had risen to Pounds
110.05m from Pounds 108.22m.

<TEXT>
UNIONS organising in the public sector should be prepared to be flexible
about traditional bargaining structures to allow better delivery of
services, a senior TUC official said yesterday, writes John Gapper.
In a study of how unions can help to improve standards in public services,
Mr Bill Callaghan, TUC assistant general secretary, said unions needed to
take 'a bold and innovative stance' and allow devolution of power.
Mr Callaghan was writing in a policy paper published by the Institute for
Public Policy Research, a left-wing research group, and the TUC. The paper
said unions should accept that competitive tendering could be good for
services.
The local government union Nalgo yesterday dropped its High Court action
challenging the validity of 54 dismissal notices issued by the London
Borough of Haringey in February.

FT  24 APR 91 / Supporters gather for Asil Nadir's third court appearance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 100 supporters of Mr Asil Nadir mustered outside Bow Street
magistrates court in London yesterday when the Polly Peck chairman made his
third court appearance on theft and false-accounting charges totalling
Pounds 25m, Raymond Hughes writes.
Sir David Hopkin, the chief metropolitan magistrate, agreed that in future
Mr Nadir (pictured) need report to his local police station only once a week
 -between 7pm and 9pm on Mondays - instead of daily. The requirement was one
of the conditions on which Mr Nadir was granted Pounds 3.5m bail in
December. Another was that he must live and sleep at his Mayfair home. That
was varied yesterday to enable him to travel out of London overnight.
Mr Simon Browne-Wilkinson, for the Serious Fraud Office, asked for the case
to be adjourned until July 23. He said the case should be ready for transfer
to a crown court within six months.
Sir David decided that the next hearing would be on July 9 when, he said, Mr
Nadir need not attend court.

FT  24 APR 91 / E Midlands companies cut training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES IN the East Midlands, one of the UK's fastest-growing regions, are
cutting their investment in training and fixed assets such as machinery and
plant as the recession affects them more severely.
That emerges from a survey of 940 companies in the region carried out by
Price Waterhouse, consultants, and Nottingham Polytechnic, and published
today. Investment cuts are taking place against an expectation in two thirds
of the companies that business conditions will worsen over the next six
months.
Although the results of the survey do not reflect either the end of the Gulf
war or the most recent cuts in interest rates, they offer broadly the same
picture of the harsh commercial climate as other recent regional surveys.
The chambers of commerce in Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, north Derbyshire
and Nottinghamshire reported in their sample that 43 per cent of companies
had smaller home order books and 30 per cent were finding that the number of
export orders was declining.
Price Waterhouse found that the worst-performing sector in the regional
economy was construction, followed by textiles and clothing. The downturn in
sales and profits had been most acute among Northamptonshire companies,
reflecting, Price Waterhouse said, 'the county's sensitivity to the deeper
recession being experienced in the south-east' of England.
In Derbyshire, where last year business confidence was higher than elsewhere
in the region, sales growth forecasts are now lower than for the rest of the
region.
Nearly half the companies in the survey expect a reduction in their capital
expenditure over the next six months.
Financial difficulties are now having a knock-on effect on employment
prospects. Nearly 30 per cent of companies are forecasting lay-offs. The
majority of wage settlements, however, are still in excess of 7.5 per cent.

FT  24 APR 91 / Backing for conditional fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW Society called on the Lord Chancellor yesterday to allow wider use
of 'no win, no pay' conditional fee arrangements as a means of improving
access to justice in cases where legal aid is not available, Robert Rice
writes.
Although the arrangements are permitted under the Courts and Legal Services
Act, the Lord Chancellor has issued a consultation paper suggesting they be
permitted only in personal injury cases.
He has also suggested that lawyers should only be allowed to increase their
normal fees by 10 per cent in such cases to compensate for the risk of
getting nothing when they lose.
The society says the maximum 10 per cent increase in normal fees is too low.
It would mean that lawyers would only undertake cases which are virtually
certain to succeed.
It also argues there are cases where conditional fees could improve access
to justice.

FT  24 APR 91 / Imports rise by 3% in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPORTS rose by more than 3 per cent last month to Pounds 9.4bn, providing
further support for theories that the recession might be close to reaching a
trough.
The increase, from a seasonally adjusted Pounds 9.1bn in February, is a sign
of a pick-up in demand from consumers and industrial groups.
Exports rose by more than 1 per cent last month, from Pounds 8.3bn in
February to Pounds 8.4bn in March.
The figures for the value of imports and exports are both down by 3 per cent
over the first quarter of this year, compared with the final three months of
1990. Compared with the January-March period last year, imports in the first
quarter of 1991 were down 10 per cent, while exports showed a reduction of 1
per cent.
The Central Statistical Office bases its judgments on longer-term trends in
the balance of payments on the figures for visible trade, not counting oil
and erratic items such as ships and precious stones. It said yesterday that
on the basis of those statistics there were clear signs that the underlying
rate of fall in imports had slackened in recent months.
The CSO is assuming a surplus of Pounds 500m in each of the first three
months of 1991 in invisible trade - services, financial payments and
government transfers. This may be revised when the government issues new
estimates for the first quarter invisibles balance.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Shares bought after legal advice,
executive believed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER chief executive of County NatWest believed the bank's buying of
Blue Arrow shares in the company's 1987 rights issue was done on the basis
of proper legal advice, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday.
Mr Peter Dale, the former managing director of County
NatWest Securities, agreed with Mr Jeremy Roberts, QC, that until early 1988
his client, Mr Jonathan Cohen, the former chief executive and one of the
defendants, had believed that proper legal advice had been taken.
Mr Dale told Mr Roberts that in February 1988, Mr Cohen had first announced
that it had become apparent that proper advice had not in fact been taken
and that that seemed to come as a surprise to him.
Mr Cohen was contradicted by Miss Elizabeth Brimelow, then County's
compliance director, who said proper advice had been taken, Mr Dale said.
Mr Dale also disputed the account given to the court by Mr Philip Rimell,
the former chairman of CNWS, of how CNWS bought 31m shares from County.
He agreed with Mr Roberts that Mr Rimell had willingly bought the shares
while he, Mr Dale, was abroad. He could not remember Mr Rimell having
telephoned him to object to the transaction and denied having instructed him
to take the shares.
The trial continues today.

FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour denies poor would be worse
off - Family policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday rejected Tory charges that its commitment to increases in
child benefit and pensions would not help the poorest families, as it
stepped up its attempt to take over the Tories' claim to be 'the party of
the family'.
At the launch of Labour's document on 'family prosperity', Mr Michael
Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, said that poorer families
would not suffer an equivalent deduction from income support with the rise
of child benefit to Pounds 9.55 a child a week.
Similarly, he said pensioners on income support would not lose out on
proposed increases in state pension.
During the Budget debate last month, ministers claimed that Labour's
calculations failed to allow for the effect of not clawing back the rise in
child benefit from families on income support.
The cost of Labour's proposals had been reduced, Mr Meacher added, by the
Budget increases in child benefit. The child benefit and pensions
commitments, costed at about Pounds 3.25bn, would broadly be met by setting
a top tax rate of 50 per cent and removing the ceiling on national insurance
contributions.
Mr Meacher said Labour would not act retrospectively, but would ensure
occupational and personal pensions provided at least as good a deal as the
state scheme.

RECORD numbers of power stations are being built in England and Wales, the
seven-year statement issued by National Grid Company disclosed yesterday.
Nine new stations, with a total capacity of 7,400MW, have signed agreements

New stations planned by National Power and PowerGen count for about 3,000MW
of the new capacity. The rest is being built by independent power projects,
notably the ICI and Enron consortium, which is planning an 1,875MW station
on Teeside.

FT  24 APR 91 / Mobil signs 15-year PowerGen gas deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOBIL HAS signed a deal with PowerGen to provide the UK electricity
generator with gas for the next 15 years.
The deal comes after last month's announcement by British Gas that it would
raise its prices to power stations for new gas purchases by 35 per cent,
arousing fears that many planned stations would be left without gas.
It will be viewed as a welcome sign that more competition is developing in
the industrial gas market previously dominated by British Gas.
Mobil will provide PowerGen with 100m cu ft of gas a day from the end of
1993 as part of a 15-year contract that will start to tail off after 10
years.
While the company would not indicate the price of gas included in the deal,
it is understood to be at a level between British Gas's existing price
schedule for power generators and its new 35 per cent higher rate for new
users.
Meanwhile PowerGen announced yesterday that it had awarded the Pounds 290m
contract to build its 680MW power station at Rye House, Hertfordshire, to
Siemens, the electronic and electrical equipment supplier.
Rye House will be a modern gas-fired station like Killingholme, PowerGen's
large new plant on Humberside, which is also being built by Siemens. Rye
House is due to become operational in 1994.
Replacing coal-fired stations with such new gas stations is a significant
plank of PowerGen's strategy, Mr Ed Wallis, the company's commercial
director, said.
In another development, Rugby Power, a partnership between East Midlands
Electricity Generation and Trafalgar House Corporate Development, is
withdrawing plans for a 380MW gas-fired power station near Rugby after local
people objected to the scheme.
Rugby Power now plans to revise and resubmit its application taking into
account the objections.

FT  24 APR 91 / Development aid record said to be lagging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN was criticised yesterday for continuing to let its development aid
lag behind the standard set for rich industrialised countries.
Although British aid is among the best managed in the world, the amount
continues to fall well below the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of
gross national product (GNP). Furthermore, the gap is widening, according to
a review published yesterday by the Paris-based Development Assistance
Committee (DAC), which monitors industrialised countries' aid performance.
The biannual study arrives asthe prime minister is under pressure to fulfil
a 1983 statement that he hoped Britain would reach the UN target.
British Official Development Assistance (ODA) has increased only marginally
in volume since the early 1980s, to reach Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.5bn) in
1989. It has fallen as a share of GNP, from 0.49 per cent in 1978-1979 to a
mere 0.31 per cent in 1989, says the report.
At that level, Britain is only the 13th most generous donor among the 18
countries belonging to the DAC, although the study shows that the UN target
is bettered by only four of them - Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and
Denmark. France claims to spend 0.78 per cent of GNP on overseas aid, but
that falls below the UN target to 0.54 per cent if its overseas territories
are counted as part of France rather than overseas developing countries.
In real terms, Britain's ODA rose by 1.1 per cent in the five years to 1989,
slightly less than half the 2.3 per cent average rate of increase for
industrialised donor governments over the same period.
The DAC recognises that the British government is planning to do better by
increasing the volume of aid by 17 per cent over the next three years, but
feels that is not enough. 'Based on present planning, the real increase in
the UK aid programme is likely to remain slight' and aid as a share of GNP
might well fall further, said a communique by the DAC.
The high quality of British aid, delivered by a strong administration with
long experience in developing countries, makes it 'all the more desirable
that the British aid efforts be increased', the DAC added.
That would also help other donor governments to win more public support for
a boost in aid.
Britain's practice of focusing aid on the poorest countries comes in for
praise, as does its policy of using aid to encourage better government, with
economic and environmental reforms. 'The UK considers that good government
and development are closely linked,' said the DAC. More donors should follow
the same philosophy, it argued.

FT  24 APR 91 / BBC to shed 720 network TV jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is to shed 720 jobs from its network television operation in London
this year as part of its cost-cutting programme and the need to source a
higher proportion of programming from independent producers.
The job losses, affecting nearly one in 10 network television employees, are
intended to save Pounds 14.5m a year. The BBC needs a Pounds 25m cut in the
costs of its network television operation by 1993.
The scheme involves closing two of the BBC's best-known studios: Television
Theatre, the Edwardian variety hall on Shepherd's Bush Green where the Wogan
chat show is filmed; and Lime Grove, where arts and current affairs
programmes, including the Late Show, are produced.
The BBC plans to shed as many jobs as possible through early retirement and
freezing recruitment but some redundancies will be unavoidable. The job
losses will be concentrated in programme resource departments such as design
and graphics, but will also affect administration. The Funding the Future
plan is designed to save Pounds 75m across its operations by 1993. The BBC
recently announced more than 100 job losses in news and current affairs and
114 in engineering.
The cuts in network TV, one of the largest parts of the BBC employing 7,750
of its 25,000 staff, employees, are also a reflection not only of Funding
the Future but of the need to satisfy government demands to commission more
independent programming.
The cuts also reflect a government demand that the ITV network and the BBC
must source at least 25 per cent of programmes from independent producers
from 1993.
Mr Will Wyatt, managing director designate of BBC Network Television, said

FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Poll date virtually rules out June
general election - Monmouth by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JUNE general election has been virtually ruled out by senior
Conservatives, the party indicated yesterday when the government announced
that the Monmouth by-election will be on May 16.
By moving the writ in the Commons for a contest just two weeks after the May
2 local elections, the Conservatives signalled that they were hoping for a
swift campaign with minimal political damage.
The decision does not completely rule out a general election in June or July
but, if the government had intended that, the by-election would probably
have been delayed until the rest of the country went to the polls. The
Tories have selected Mr Roger Evans, a 44-year-old barrister, to contest the
poll, which follows the death of Sir John Stradling-Thomas, a former Tory
deputy chief whip.
Labour, which came second in the Monmouth poll in 1987, hopes to mount an
effective challenge as a springboard for the general election. Mr Peter
Mandelson, former director of campaigns, has been brought in as a campaign
adviser and is expected to take a significant role in directing the party's
campaign. A poll by BBC Wales suggests Labour is starting the contest with
41 per cent of the vote, against 39 per cent for the Tories. The party's
candidate is Mr Huw Edwards, a 38-year-old lecturer.
A senior Liberal Democrat official said the contest 'has all the ingredients
of another Ribble Valley', but the BBC Wales poll gave the party just 16 per
cent. Its candidate is Ms Frances David, a 57-year-old school teacher.
1987 election: Conservatives, 22,387. Labour, 13,037. SDP/Alliance, 11,313.
Plaid Cymru, 363. Conservative majority: 9,350.

FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Phone tax opposition grows -
Finance bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Tory MP is to attempt to reverse the government's plans for taxing
portable phones when the Commons considers the Finance Bill, Ralph Atkins
writes.
Sir William Clark, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, says he
will table two amendments to the proposals for taxing mobile phones provided
by employers and used for personal calls as a benefit-in-kind worth Pounds
200.
The first amendment would overturn the government's plans. If that fails,
the second would exempt those who made only a very few personal calls on
such telephones.
A survey of Conservative MPs by Access Opinions, an independent research
company, showed 60 per cent of Tory MPs opposed to the plans announced in
the Budget.
British Coal would face difficulty obtaining planning permission for
opencast or surface mining in Wales if recommendations by the Welsh Affairs
committee are adopted.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Guinness appeals: Judges to hear medical view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE about the medical condition of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former
chairman and chief executive of Guinness, serving a five-year jail sentence
for his part in the Guinness affair, will be heard by the appeal court
today.
The three judges may decide to sit in private to hear the testimony of
doctors who have examined Mr Saunders on behalf of his lawyers and the
Serious Fraud Office.
Yesterday Mr Anthony Shaw, Mr Saunders' counsel, asked that the evidence be
heard in chambers in Mr Saunders' absence.
That, he said, would enable the doctors not to be constrained by
professional reticence about discussing Mr Saunders' condition in front of
him or in public.
He said he appreciated that the appeal was a matter of public interest being
heard in public, but there were larger humanitarian considerations.
The court could decide what it would be proper to make public in its
judgment, Mr Shaw said.
Lord Justice Neill said the court's provisional view was that the appeal
should remain public but it would consider the matter again today afterthe
doctors had met and discovered any disagreements between them.
He said: 'This is a case where we are very reluctant, unless overriding
considerations apply, to deal with it otherwise than in open court.
I think we shall need to be satisfied there are particular aspects of the
medical evidence that ought not to be publicly known.'
Mr Saunders; Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker; and Mr Gerald Ronson,
head of the Heron group, are appealing against convictions and sentences. Mr
Parnes is serving 2 1/2 years. Mr Ronson, released in February after serving
just under half his 12-month sentence, was also fined Pounds 5m.
Mr John Chadwick, QC, for the SFO, defended the allegation made against Mr
Saunders during the trial that he had intended keeping Pounds 3m of Pounds
5.2m he authorised Guinness to pay Mr Tom Ward, a US lawyer and Guinness
director.
Mr Saunders has complained that the allegation, and the way the trial judge
dealt with it, prejudiced his defence.
Mr Chadwick said the allegation had been properly made to test Mr Saunders'
credibility as a witness and correctly dealt with in the judge's summing-up.

FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: SDP Duck in Drake city? - Local
election diary (Plymouth)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLYMOUTH'S local elections look likely to form the final chapter in the
chronicle of a political death long foretold.
Under the leadership of a local boy, Dr David Owen, the city of Sir Francis
Drake could claim to be the principal birthplace of grassroots social
democracy.
Ten years on, both Labour and the Tories are promising that Social Democrats
Plymouth - the P for party was redesignated to the city's name just a few
months ago - will be finally laid to rest next week.
As with the demise of the Alliance, Dr Owen himself is accused of having
played a leading part in digging the grave. Reports that the member for
Devonport is considering a shift rightward to the Tories were widely deemed
the last straw.
At the borough council elections in 1987, the SDP fought every seat. This
time, it is contesting only 15 in Dr Owen's Devonport constituency  - three
of which are even being challenged by their old Alliance partners, the
Liberal Democrats.
Mr Harold Luscombe, local SDP leader, admired by many but loathed by Labour,
claims the party can hold the five seats it commands on the 60-seat council.
Yet the impact of several defections to the Tories and a resurgent Labour
party, especially in the job-depleted docklands, make that improbable.
Pressed, Mr Luscombe admits that annihilation is a possibility.
Until May 2 at least, the party will continue to fight on a fiercely
independent platform that has something to irritate everyone in the big
parties.
That includes a Torier-than-Tory plan to sell off a participation in the
still uncompleted Pounds 25m municipal conference and leisure centre to the
private sector - opposed as unrealistic by the Conservatives.
Mr Luscombe annoys Labour by castigating his old party as spendthrift. 'I
look back on the last few years with a certain pride,' he says. 'Nationally,
we have been the saviours of the Labour party.
'The ridiculous thing is that as the party leadership has become more
moderate, the local party has been going the other way.'
Three miles away in Keyham ward, the sober suits and yet more sober language
of Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's national organiser, and Mr John Ingham, the
local leader, appear to tell a different story.
As in the party's campaigns in Nottingham and Milton Keynes, the heavy
emphasis is on a council partnership with private enterprise and the
community.
If Tory taunts about a hidden agenda ring hollow, local Labour economics
seem firmly rooted in the wishful-thinking school. In Plymouth, the party
claims it could have set a poll tax Pounds 10 below the Tories' Pounds 380
largely by persuading non-payers to do their civic duty.
Nevertheless, Labour - currently with 23 seats on the council to the Tories'
31 - looks in with a real chance to take control for the first time in 25
years.
Dr Colin Rallings, a psephologist at Plymouth's South West Polytechnic,
calculates that the same 8 per cent swing is needed as Labour requires
nationally to take power.
Last year's county council elections in key Tory wards proved that was
possible. But in a general election, much would depend on whether Dr Owen's
fans jump left or right.
The three-way split in all three parliamentary seats makes Devonport
winnable for Labour. Dame Janet Fookes' Plymouth Drake is also vulnerable if
the SDP vote collapses as predicted.
Ironically, Mr Alan Clark, the defence minister much disparaged in Plymouth
for failing to defend the city's navy interests, seems safest, with a 4,000
majority over the Liberal Democrats.
Plymouth's difficulties - housing, the need to diversify from a single
industry base, lack of development land - are relatively commonplace.
As in the other towns visited by this diary, that creates difficulties from
a political point of view, as the options are limited.
Often, for little more than the satisfaction of personal ambitions,
strenuous efforts are made to dress up what a broad consensus into the
tribal warpaints of national politics.
One missed opportunity is a curious fact that elsewhere might provoke
controversy - as a security measure the entire city centre is permanently
filmed by video cameras, monitored by the council's security men.
In the event, that draconian measure has not only sharply reduced petty
crime - it has also met approval from Tory, Labour and Democrats of both
Social and Liberal tendencies.
Three centuries on, the city that saw off the Armada has silently fallen to
the unblinking tyranny of electronic technology.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Local authorities split over plans for
reform - Council reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
LOCAL authorities' opinion on the reforms was split last night.
Sir Jack Layden, chairman of the Labour-dominated Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, said: 'It's a Whitehall tax which gives massive
control to government ministers. It's excessively complicated and unjust.'
Mr John Chatfield, chairman of the Association of County Councils, said his
organisation had recommended the move towards a property-based tax and a
single tier of local government, which it believed would be the counties.
Mr Roy Thomason, chairman of the Association of District Councils, said:
'This is just what we need.' He was convinced that the single tier of
government would generally be the district councils.
Mr Alan Stenning, director of finance at Islington Borough Council, London,
was concerned that there would be little time to implement the new tax once
the consultation period was over.
Ms Margaret Hodge, leader of Islington council, said the new tax was still
unfair because it was not related to ability to pay. 'The poll tax
experiment has cost almost Pounds 400 per adult, so it would have been nice
if the government had said 'sorry,' she said.
The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation, representing private
valuers and council revenue officers, welcomed the new tax. 'It will
unquestionably be simpler to collect and enforce than the community charge,'
said Mr Colin Farrington, director.
However, he warned that the timetable to introduce the tax by 1993 was very
tight and estimated it would take three to five years after its introduction
to return to the very high collection levels present under the old rating
system.
Mrs Jean McFadden, president of the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities, welcomed the government's green paper 'as the first step away
from the hated poll tax.'
Mr Roger Cumberland, finance director at Radnorshire District Council, said
he had always been in favour of unitary local authority, but hoped the
government would not introduce it until after the new financial structure
was in place for at least one year.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Easing the burden in Tory marginals -
Political impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
THE NEW local tax would benefit all two-person households in the Labour
London borough of Lambeth, but in marginal Tory Bath such households in the
54 per cent of homes worth more than Pounds 88,000 would pay more. That
suggests either altruism or a belief that some supporters can be taken for
granted.
A more complex picture emerges beyond those extreme examples of the massed
ranks of figures provided by the government to illustrate how the council
tax would work.
The numbers themselves are subject to some caveats. They are based on bills
and not on actual amounts paid, so that the real benefit to people who did
well from the community charge reduction scheme, because they live in homes
that had low rateable values, will be less than the headline difference
suggests.
The reduction scheme has been added to the central government grant, leaving
a lower amount (Pounds 6.8bn) to be raised from local authorities, and the
cost of collection has been assumed to be 40 per cent of the cost of
collecting the poll tax.
In general, however, Tory marginals will breathe a sigh of relief.
Mr David Martin, the Tory MP for Portsmouth South, has a majority of just
205. With a Portsmouth city council poll tax at Pounds 179, households of
two or more people in five of the seven bands - 94 per cent of homes - would
pay less under the new tax.
In Pendle, where Mr John Lee, the Tory MP whose majority is below 3,000, has
been an outspoken critic of the poll tax, the gains for two-person
households look impressive.
Almost 70 per cent of homes fall within the lowest two property bands, under
which two-person households would gain from the switch to the new system.
With the release of the figures halfway through the local election campaign,
the first test of how well they survive sustained political debate may come
in the Monmouth by-election to be held in mid May.
Although most single-person households would be worse off under the new
system, households of two or more in the roughly three quarters of homes
valued below Pounds 90,000 would benefit.
Will it be enough?

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Gamble aims to end Tories' trauma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
SO FAR, so good. The poll tax is all but dead, although the extended burial
service will take a full two years to complete. The initial reaction to its
successor the council tax, finally announced yesterday after weeks of
agonising, was a qualified welcome to a pragmatic package targeted to meet
the many anxieties of Conservative supporters.
However, the drastic nature of the solution, which represents the biggest
political U-turn for years, shows how traumatised ministers have become over
the damage inflicted by the poll tax.
A return to the rates is a gamble which has no guarantee of success, but at
least it gives ministers a chance to restore electoral credibility and to
seek to repair some of the harm done to the Tory party by the introduction
of a local tax widely perceived as regressive and unfair.
Mr Heseltine's original idea was to launch an across-the-board inquiry into
all aspects of local government - finance, structure and organisation. That
remains the intention, but the indications from yesterday's consultation
papers are that the inquiry has degenerated into a piecemeal approach
because of the need to ditch the poll tax fast.
Virtually all effort has been focused on that. Any changes in structure and
organisation lie well in the future.
In the short term, at least, the tactic might work. The figures show an
estimated average household charge for two or more people in the top
property band of Pounds 668 and in the lowest band of Pounds 267 - well
below the last average rates bill or the average poll tax paid last year.
That is clearly good news for the government, particularly as the measures
have been framed to avoid the big variations under the old rating system and
to ensure there are not too many losers in the prime Tory territory of the
south-east.
There is therefore political logic in not creating too many losers among
Tory supporters, and economic logic in the restoration of a link between the
size of bills and ability to pay. It looks a skilful package, although it
will lay the government open to the charge of looking after its own
supporters at the cost of others.
Yet many difficulties remain, mainly because no real attempt has been made
to link reform of finance to reform of structure. Mr Heseltine and Mr Major
may ultimately pay a heavy price for such a lopsided approach. The
impression remains that the shape of local government is being refashioned
almost accidentally as a result of the earlier botched attempt to abolish
the unpopular rating system.
The establishment of a fairer, more soundly based method of local
revenue-raising will not end the tensions between local and central
government, stretched almost to breaking point by the bruising fiasco of the
poll tax.
The confusion of responsibility between town halls and Whitehall has become
an increasing source of conflict over the last decade and the consultation
paper on structure showed that everything remains to be decided.
Battle lines are already being drawn up in the conflict that is about to
start over the introduction of unitary authorities, with many counties
fighting for their existence against pressures from the districts to take
over their powers.
Mr Heseltine has guaranteed a lengthy, messy process by emphasising that it
will be largely up to local opinion to decide what form of local
administration is required, including in some cases the retention of two
tiers of authorities.
Politically the difficulty is that the majority of both county and district
councils are at present Conservative-led and the party could be badly split
by the conflicts.
The blight of the poll tax might not yet be over. It might continue to
distort domestic politics until clear lines for local and national
administrative responsibilities are finally decided, and that is still some
way off.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Cheers and some relief from the party
faithful - Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
GOVERNMENT supporters showered congratulations on Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, in the Commons yesterday when he promised to bury the
poll tax and replace it with a council tax with a 'property and personal
element'.
Any lingering doubts on Tory benches about the effectiveness of the
long-awaited funeral arrangements were dispelled by Mr Nigel Lawson, the
former chancellor, whose objections to the introduction of the poll tax were
overruled by Mrs Margaret Thatcher when prime minister.
Ministers and Conservative backbenchers were clearly relieved when Mr
Lawson, who recently warned of the political perils that would be associated
with a replacement identifiable as 'son of poll tax', joined the welcome
given to Mr Heseltine's proposals.
Mr Lawson said there would be widespread relief that the government had had
the courage to 'consign the poll tax to oblivion' and to take a firm
decision that its successor should be property-based.
Labour's relatively unsuccessful attempt to give Mr Heseltine a rough ride
was led by Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, who emphasised
that the poll tax, with all its unfairness, would continue until 1993.
To cheers from Labour colleagues, Mr Gould protested that the new local tax
would be 'skewed' to protect the rich from paying their fair share.
Mr Heseltine repeatedly underlined the government's determination to
'intensify the capping regimes' to ensure high-spending, Labour-controlled
councils could not force up the new tax to unacceptable levels.
Mr Gould suggested that the allocation of properties in England to seven
different valuation bands reflected the 'seven strands' of opinion in Mr
John Major's divided cabinet, which was too weak to kill the poll tax
outright.
While deploring the government's failure to say 'sorry', he interpreted Mr
Heseltine's announcement as an admission that the poll tax had been a
disastrous mistake, costing the taxpayer Pounds 18m a day.
Mr Gould scoffed: 'The party that brought us the head tax now offers us a
stand-on-your-heads tax, but whether it is heads or tails, the British
people remain the losers.'
The new local tax, he said, was the outcome of a disreputable union between
the poll tax and political panic.
Mr Gould argued that the only consultations about the new local tax that
really mattered would take place through the local government elections on
May 2 and the coming general election. Amid further Labour cheers, and Tory
jeers, he forecast that the voters would 'kill off this Tory tax once and
for all by electing a Labour government'.
Mr Heseltine contrasted the 'certainty' of the government's proposals with
Labour's 'fair rates' alternative, which he claimed would involve returning
to the old rating system prior to a further upheaval leading to the
introduction of a different tax a year later. He also insisted that a Labour
government would not act to curb spendthrift councils.
Sir Norman Fowler (C, Sutton Coldfield), another former cabinet minister,
provided further reassurance for government supporters by likening the
reaction of Labour MPs to a recognition that 'their fox has been shot'.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Alan Beith said the product of Mr Heseltine's
announcement was not 'the son of poll tax but the son of rates'.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Changes to be adapted to Scottish needs -
Scotland/Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
IN SCOTLAND the new council tax will operate in the same way as planned for
England and Wales, Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, announced yesterday.
However, while the discount, rebate and transitional arrangements would be
the same, some details of the tax might be varied to meet Scottish
circumstances.
Most households in Scotland were in the lowest three bands, where the
average bill for a two-person household would be Pounds 380 and Pounds 280
for a one-person household, Mr Lang said.
To prevent the new tax from reaching unacceptable levels, he said he was
making his capping powers - not exercised in Scotland under the poll tax -
equal with those of the Environment and Welsh secretaries.
A new system for the payment of water and sewerage charges would also be
introduced.
Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, told the Commons that detailed
arrangements to replace the poll tax in Wales might need to differ to meet
local circumstances. The taxing of second homes was one area where different
provisions might be needed.
'The proposal I have brought forward today looks at Wales as a country in
itself,' he said. 'There is no transposition of values from England to
Wales.'
Mr Donald Dewar, opposition spokesman for Scotland, said the system had been
rigged to protect the better-off. 'Can it be right that the most expensive
property in Newton Mearns or Morningside pays at the most only two and a
half times the most battered council house in Easterhouse or Pilton?' he
asked.
The move to a single-tier tax was 'riding on Labour's coat-tails', according
to Mr Barry Jones, the party's Welsh spokesman, who also accused the
government of giving 'special treatment' to the wealthiest people in Wales.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Proposals for the poll tax replacement set
out in detail - Local funding consultation document
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
THE consultation document A New Tax For Local Government sets out in some
detail the government's proposals for the new council tax, to come into
effect by April 1993.
Basic proposals: 'The government has decided that from the earliest possible
moment the community charge will be replaced by a new system of local
taxation. The new 'council tax' will comprise a property and a personal
element. But it will take the form of a single bill for each household,
based on the value of the property and the number of adults who live in it.'
Discounts: As 54 per cent of households have two adults living in them, 'the
government favours a discount approach on the assumption that there are two
adults in each household. Households with two or more adults would pay the
basic council tax for their property. Single-adult households would pay less
through a personal discount indicated on the bill.
'Under these proposals, some 38m adults in Great Britain would be taken into
account directly in calculating bills. Only 4m adults would be excluded,
many of whom - for example students and people on income support - would be
eligible for personal discounts even if they were to be counted for the tax.
'A significant advantage of the discount approach is that there is no need
for a register of council tax payers. Households simply receive a bill which
assumes two adults, but pay a reduced bill through a discount where there is
only one liable adult or two discounts where there are none or where the
property is not a principal place of residence.
'The government favours setting the personal discount as a percentage of the
basic bill of the household. It proposes that the discount should be 25 per
cent of the basic bill.'
Banding: Assessing the taxable value of domestic properties based on rental
values, capital values or rebuilding costs . . . would pose various
problems. The government therefore proposes to adopt a new approach: a
banding system.
'Each property would be allocated to one of a small number of bands.
Households in properties in the same band in a council's area would receive
the same basic council tax bill. There would be no need for a detailed
valuation of all dwellings.
'The banding system could be designed to ensure that excessive burdens did
not fall on a minority of properties. Undue variations in bills arising from
regional variations in property values could be avoided. Banding would
reduce the administrative task involved in the introduction of the new
council tax and allow it to be achieved more quickly.
'The government proposes a system by which all properties in an area would
be placed in one of a small number of bands constructed around the average
property value in the relevant country - England, Scotland or Wales.
'The government proposes that a couple living in the highest band would pay
two thirds more than a couple living in a property in the middle band. A
couple living in a property in the lowest band would pay two thirds of the
bill for a middle-band property. Overall, bills for couples in the highest
band would be two and a half times as much as those for couples in the
lowest band.'
Valuation: The Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue will supervise the
assignment of properties to bands. There would be no need for regular or
frequent revaluations of properties under a system of banding.
Multiple occupancy: The government proposes to bring some houses within the
scope of non-domestic rating when there is multiple occupancy, or where
adults are joint owners or tenants, recognising that many properties of this
kind are run as businesses.
Second homes: Where a property is not anyone's main residence, the
government proposes that the bill should then be reduced by the maximum of
two personal discounts.
Rebates: 'The government proposes that, for individuals or couples on income
support or equivalent levels of income, rebates should meet 100 per cent of
their liability to the council tax. There would be no minimum contribution.
'People on incomes above the income support level will contribute on a
sliding scale.'
Where non-dependants on low incomes live as the second adult in households
where the occupier is not eligible for a rebate, there should be a full
personal discount where the person is at or below the income support level.
Students: Where the first or second adult in a property is a student, a
student nurse, an apprentice or a Youth Training trainee, each will receive
a full personal discount. If there are no other adults in a household of
students, the household will receive two discounts.
Government grants and assessments: The system of standard spending
assessments by central government will remain, and under the new council tax
'grants will be paid to local authorities so that each area can finance
spending at a standard level by levying the standard taxable amounts fixed
by the secretary of state for the council tax.
'Local authorities would retain discretion to set their budgets above or
below the standard level . . . The government's intention is that an
authority's spending above or below the standard level will be reflected in
its council tax bills.
'The variation in spending should fall proportionately on the bills of all
council tax payers in the area, so that each household would see an equal
percentage increase or reduction in their bill compared with the level for
standard spending.'
Two-tier authorities: 'In areas with more than one tier of authorities, the
tiers should each set their own separate element of the council tax, and the
separate elements should be clearly identifiable on the single bill.'
Capping: The government will continue to use its powers to cap excessive
local authority spending. Powers for capping Scottish authorities will be
adjusted to equate with those in England and Wales.
Business rates: No changes are proposed in the business rate system
introduced in 1990.

FT  24 APR 91 / Greenspan hits at banking proposal: Treasury plan 'would
encourage foreign banks to move away from the US'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has strongly criticised
US Treasury proposals requiring foreign banks to set up separately
capitalised local holding companies if they wish to take advantage of the
opening up of US financial services.
Mr Greenspan told the Senate banking committee yesterday such a requirement
would impose additional costs on foreign banks without obvious benefits. 'It
also creates an inducement for foreign banks to conduct their banking
operations in less costly environments outside the US and for foreign
authorities to threaten reciprocal restrictions for US financial firms
abroad.'
Under the plan, which has already been attacked by international bankers,
any foreign bank engaged in activities other than simple banking would have
to close its current American branches and agencies involved in securities
and underwriting operations and conduct all of its US banking business
through a US subsidiary bank. This would also apply to any expansion into
these areas.
In spite of reservations on a number of points, Mr Greenspan endorsed the
general thrust of the Treasury's wide-ranging bank reform plan, saying it
attacked 'the major root causes of the problems in the banking system'. In
particular, he said a majority of the Fed board supported the proposed
overhaul of deposit insurance, tightening of supervisory procedures, removal
of restrictions on interstate branch banking and authorisation of new
investment activities for well capitalised bank holding companies.
However, the prospects for comprehensive banking reform this year have
receded because of a desire, especially on the House banking committee, to
concentrate on legislation to bolster the financially strained bank
insurance fund.
But Mr Greenspan urged Congress to 'avoid only partial solutions by
separating into component parts the comprehensive proposals for reform such
as those suggested by the Treasury.'
He said the Fed board was troubled about the proposal that the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation could borrow up to Dollars 25bn (Pounds
14.7bn) from Federal Reserve Banks to absorb losses sustained by the bank
insurance fund in dealing with failed banks.
This would involve the Fed in directly funding the government. Such funding
always been severely limited because of concerns about compromising the
independent conduct of monetary policy. It would be better, and have an
identical financial and economic impact, if the Treasury made the necessary
loans, he said.
Mr Greenspan also warned against too large an increase in premiums paid by
banks to support the insurance fund, which might threaten the soundness and
competitiveness of the banking system.
He also underlined the Fed's opposition to removing its present supervisory
authority over bank holding companies and limiting it to (mainly smaller)
state chartered banks.

FT  24 APR 91 / Dinkins dithers as NY sinks in the quagmire: Bernard Simon
on the Big Apple's big problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST every city in North America is feeling a three-way squeeze these
days, but New York is worse.
The recession is eroding tax revenues; demands for social welfare and other
costly services are spiralling; yet little help is forthcoming from
governments preoccupied with balancing their own budgets.
These woes are only part, however, of the economic and political quagmire in
which New York finds itself. The fiscal crunch in the US's biggest city is
being compounded by a mayor seemingly unable to take tough decisions, a
white business community nervous about upsetting the black mayor, and
bureaucrats and trade union leaders who want everyone to make sacrifices
except themselves.
New York's latest budget worries have not yet reached the proportions of the
mid-1970s, when the city came close to financial collapse. 'It's a difficult
problem, but it's not a crisis,' says Mr Quentin Spector, executive director
of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the body set up 15 years ago as
banker to the city, which now acts mainly as a financial adviser.
The budget impasse has so far had little more impact on New Yorkers than the
prospect of a shortened season at municipal swimming pools this summer,
fewer lifeguards on the beaches, and a drive for private donations to save
the Central Park petting zoo.
The long-term damage could be far more severe. While the budget deficit is
projected at a relatively manageable Dollars 450m-500m for the fiscal year
to June 30, it is expected to soar to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in 1991/92.
The city's borrowing ability is also at risk, at a time when it needs to
raise about Dollars 3bn a year to fund new capital projects. New York bonds
are already trading at a premium of about 1 percentage-point to those of
issuers with a similar credit rating.
Mr Don Mele, director for public issues at City Partnership, a non-profit
civic group, is worried that the improvements made to New York's
infrastructure over the past decade - ranging from street repairs to
gleaming new subway carriages - will gradually unravel if a solution is not
found to the budget problem.
At the core of the problem is New York's heavy exposure to the real estate
and financial services businesses, and related sectors, which have been
especially hard hit by the recession. The city's economy tumbled into
recession more than a year before the rest of the country, and has felt its
impact far more severely.
According to the New York Port Authority, construction activity fell by 28
per cent last year, compared to a national decline of only 11 per cent. With
many high-income earners in the financial services and related industries
out of work, retail sales dipped by 1.2 per cent last year, against a 3.9
per cent advance in the country as a whole.
Matters have been made worse by the dithering of Mayor David Dinkins and the
intransigence of the city's trade unions.
Instead of taking the tough decisions needed to balance the budget, Mr
Dinkins has gone out of his way to avoid confrontation with the city's many
special interest groups. He lifted, then reimposed, a freeze on hiring
municipal workers. At the same time, he has proposed hiring several thousand
police officers to dampen fears about a new crime wave.
Several deadlines are looming. The financial markets' opinion of New York's
financial condition will become clearer within the next 10 days when the
city is expected to raise about Dollars 1bn in 'revenue-anticipation' bonds
 -money required because the New York state budget, which will provide for
transfers to the city, is itself almost a month overdue.
If Mr Dinkins fails to bring the municipal budget shortfall below Dollars
100m by the end of June or if the city is shut out of the capital markets,
administration of municipal finances could pass to the Financial Control
Board, another agency set up in the mid-1970s to bring more discipline to
New York's financial affairs.
The chances are slim that the FCB, whose members include the governor, the
mayor, city and state comptrollers and three private-sector nominees, will
actually step in. Whether by fiscal prudence or by some sleight-of-hand
accounting, Mr Dinkins is likely to pull out all the stops to avoid the
humiliation of outside intervention.
According to Mr Spector, 'the betting seems to be that the city will make it
through 1991 intact, but partly by mortgaging 1992. The question is: Will
they use that time well?'
The answer depends largely on how quickly the city emerges from recession
and can rebuild its eroded tax base. Ms Nancy Feldman, an analyst at
Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency, asserts that 'there's no question New York
will lag the rest of the country.'
The danger is that a prolonged slump or very slow recovery will not give Mr
Dinkins the tax revenues he needs to balance the 1991/92 budget. The city
will then face far more unpleasant choices than it does today, plus the risk
of more severe labour strife and political turmoil.

FT  24 APR 91 / Fall in durables orders sets back recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of an early end to the US recession have been undermined by an
unexpectedly large drop in new orders for manufactured durable goods. Orders
in March fell 6.2 per cent to the lowest level since August 1987, Peter
Riddell writes from Washington.
The financial markets had been expecting a small rise in new orders
following declines in three of the previous four months. The sharp drop
revived hopes of a possible cut in interest rates and contributed both to a
rise in government bond prices and to a weakening in the dollar.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, yesterday told the
Senate banking committee that current conditions suggested the economy was
'still modestly moving lower,' but at a diminishing rate.
He expected the recession 'to bottom out in a reasonably short period
ahead'.
He said the Fed continued to examine the economy on a 'day-by-day' basis and
the options remained open for interest rate movement. But he warned that the
current rate of inflation was 'more worrisome' than the rate in the summer
of 1986, during a previous economic slowdown.
Significantly, there was weakness across the board in durable goods orders,
affecting nearly all big industries. New orders for non-defence capital
goods equipment, generally regarded as a leading indicator for business
investment, fell by 10.3 per cent in March.
Excluding defence, new orders fell by 5.4 per cent.
Yesterday's report runs contrary to some other recent, more positive
indicators, such as in the housing sector, which suggested that the
recession might be bottoming out and a recovery could start by the late
summer. It raises the question of whether total output, as measured by real
gross national product, will continue to drop in the current period, which
would represent three successive quarters of decline.
Some economists have pointed to a recent rise in stock/inventory levels as
suggesting that any pick-up may be delayed and limited.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH exporters made FFr11.4bn (Pounds 1.13bn) of net claims on
state-guaranteed contracts last year, equivalent to around 1 per cent of
France's total overseas sales, said Coface, the French export credit
guarantee agency.
The figure, the balance between overall repayments on state-guaranteed
exports handled by Coface and premium and other income, is a slight increase
on the FFr10.9bn of claims on state-covered exports paid out the previous
year.
It does not include claims expected from unpaid bills related to the Gulf
war, likely to be around FFr5bn this year, Coface officials said.
Coface saw a 23 per cent rise in reimbursements it had to pay out on its own
account, rather than on the export credit guarantees it manages on behalf of
the government. These rose from FFr290m to FFr345m, with the worst
performance coming from the recession-hit UK, plus Spain and Italy, said Mr
Henri Baquiast, chairman of Coface.
The group covers short-term credits of less than three years and political
risks in the European Community, while it acts as an agency for the state
for most non-EC political risks and medium-term credit guarantees.

AT least 74 people have been killed and over 800 injured in an earthquake
which shook the Caribbean coasts of Costa Rica and Panama on Monday evening.
Rescuers were yesterday struggling to free more victims trapped under
rubble.
The epicentre of the tremor, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, was
40km south-east of the Costa Rican banana-exporting port of Puerto Limon.
Banana production is the main economic activity in the region and is thought
to have been badly disrupted.
Scores of buildings in Puerto Limon were destroyed, and fires broke out at
the state-run oil refinery close to the port. Communications have been
disrupted, as have water and sewage systems. Tidal waves hit the islands
around Bocas del Toro in Panama.
The Panama-based Union Of Banana Exporting Countries (UPEB) said: 'We know
there has been serious damage to the roads and infrastructure, but we do not
yet know the full extent of the damage to the plantations.'
The main producers in the region, United Brands, Standard Fruit and Del
Monte, all have plantations in the earthquake zone.

THE Brazilian government will appeal to the Supreme Court this week to stop
a wave of judgments allowing people to withdraw cruzados blocked in an
Dollars 80bn (Pounds 47.3bn) asset freeze last year, alleging that the
resulting increase in money supply could scupper its economic stabilisation
plan, Christina Lamb writes from Rio.
Ms Zelia Cardoso, the economy minister, said on Brazilian television: 'If
the court decides that all the money should be liberated I wash my hands of
all responsibility over what may happen to inflation.'
The government appeal comes in response to a series of regional court
decisions declaring its asset freeze, the centrepiece of a drastic
anti-inflation plan, unconstitutional. This has led people to ask the courts
to free their money. There are 70,000 cases pending.

<TEXT>
CHINA has stepped up its war of nerves with Hong Kong over the government's
plans for a HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7.53bn) airport by welcoming outline
proposals from a leading local construction entrepreneur for an alternative
HKDollars 60bn private sector-based project.
This has emerged at a time when some international construction companies
are beginning to reassess their interest in tendering for the government
project because contracts are stalled by the row with China, which is
refusing to give approval until it gains partial control over the project.
Mr Gordon Wu, founder-chairman of Hong Kong-based Hopewell Holdings, met Lu
Ping, Peking's senior official with direct responsibility for Hong Kong in
Peking during the past two days.
Hopewell officials reported that Mr Wu's ideas had been 'fully supported' by
the officials, who said they wanted to see the project 'fully in the private
sector' and would help with air traffic rights.
Although there is no suggestion of any immediate contract negotiations, the
move is significant because Mr Wu gained support from a number of leading
Hong Kong property developers and other businessmen during a series of
private conversations before he went to Peking on Sunday. It is unlikely
that the Hong Kong government would be prepared to switch to Mr Wu's plans
and hand over control to the private sector. It would also resist giving
government land to the developers.
It is believed that Mr Wu's talks covered the possibility of the businessmen
starting construction in 1997, immediately after Hong Kong returns to
Chinese sovereignty.
Two key preliminary contracts, each worth about HKDollars 1bn-HKDollars
1.5bn, which should have been awarded this month, have not yet been signed.
One is expected to go to Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) for reclamation work in
the Kowloon area connected with approach roads, and another is slated for
Shui On Construction, a local contractor, to move a nearby typhoon shelter
and reclaim land.
Wimpey Construction of the UK has decided not to go ahead at this stage with
an application next month to be pre-qualified for one of the largest
contracts, worth an estimated HKDollars 6bn-8bn, to reclaim land and build
the main airport platform. Other international contractors are expected to
review their interest in tendering for this and other Hong Kong projects
because of the growing air of uncertainty.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S offer of up to 50,000 passports to key Hong Kong people has been
poorly received by managers and administrators, the individuals the package
was designed to attract, Angus Foster writes from Hong Kong.
Just fewer than 15,000 passports have been allocated for public sector
managers and administrators, the largest job category in the package. The
quota has been under-subscribed by about 10 per cent, according to Mr Donald
Tsang, director of administration.
The package was introduced last year under the British Nationality Act. It
was one of a series of measures designed to restore confidence in Hong Kong,
severely shocked by the crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in
Peking in June 1989.
All the other job categories have been over-subscribed, some heavily. The
government received 1,000 applications from legal professionals by the time
the offer closed at the end of February against a quota for this category of
only 185.
Mr Tsang said the response by private sector managers and administrators was
not surprising because they were the only people who had to disclose details
about income.

FT  24 APR 91 / Kashmir guerrillas flourish under iron fist: India's brutal
methods have helped a small insurgency spread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE handful of armed separatists Indian security forces faced in Kashmir
three years ago have grown into groups of militants with a total strength
running into thousands and spread across the region.
They are now better armed, self-consciously revelling in the Kalashnikovs,
rocket-launchers, revolvers, handgrenades and automatic weapons captured
from Indian troops. Many are being trained in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In Srinagar, the militants appear to have established 'no-go' areas in parts
of the city that are surrounded by Indian paramilitary forces, but into
which the Indians dare not go except in strength.
The most important factor boosting the militants' cause has been the harsh,
repressive measures used by Indian forces. Mr Girish Saxena, the governor of
the state, concedes the damage atrocities have done. 'In our efforts to keep
down the level of alienation and increase confidence,' he says, 'any excess
sets us back.'
Though security forces are showing more restraint in Srinagar and some other
towns, the governor's orders seem largely ignored in search operations
carried out in villages. India's paramilitary forces in the state are
overstretched, ill-disciplined and in-creasingly hardened to the use of
brutality.
As with most insurgency movements that have spread rapidly, the expansion of
the revolution has created its own disorders. There has been a mushrooming
of guerrilla factions - somewhat reminiscent of Lebanon - competing and
quarrelling among themselves.
What is clear is that the best armed and trained are the fundamentalist
groups like the Hezb-e-Mujahideen, which backs the Pakistani claim to the
valley . Militant groups impose their own system of 'taxation', levying
contributions at gunpoint from traders and businessmen.
They intimidate officials to ensure that taxes, telephone and electricity
bills remain unpaid. Increasingly they determine what new appointments are
made and how funds (made available from New Delhi) are spent.
They have destroyed whatever hopes there were of reviving tourism this year
by kidnapping two Swedes.
Other pillars of the economy - handicrafts and the marketing of fresh fruit
 -have also been crippled. Wealthier Kashmiri Moslems are leaving the
valley, announcing their departures as temporary.
The governor, and some of his officials, see encouraging signs in growing
public weariness of the tension and disruption. In Srinagar there has been a
strong popular reaction against the recent wave of kidnappings. A large
crowd turned out recently for the funeral of a senior police official shot
in Srinagar. More people are seeking the administration's help in face of
the difficulties of daily life.
Intelligence reports apparently indicate that some of the militant groups
are ready to respond to Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar's offer of talks.
Individual militants are said to be fed up with a struggle that they - no
more than the Indian forces - can win militarily, and which will probably
lead to their own death.
'People now believe - and this goes for 90 per cent of the population - that
this course of armed violence cannot achieve any objective. It is bound to
fail,' says Mr Saxena.
In these circumstances he adds: 'The (government's) objective is to give a
chance to anyone who is prepared to join the mainstream and take part in the
political process.'
But hopes of meaningful talks with the militants that could bring about a
political solution still seem to be wishful thinking. There is no government
in New Delhi with the authority to make concessions. The main political
parties are deeply divided over how much autonomy India is willing to grant
to a Moslem-dominated area on Pakistan's borders.
There are equally deep divisions between the military and the civilian
leadership in Kashmire over the balance to be struck between the use of the
carrot and the stick. Mr Saxena, who became governor a year ago, clearly
favours more carrot. But the ill-trained and often ill-educated paramilitary
forces on which he depends are more familiar with the more blunt methods of
torture and brutality. That way the insurgency continues to spread.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH in India's gross domestic product is projected to slow down this year
to less than 4 per cent for the first time in six years.
The Reserve Bank of India expects GDP to rise this year by 'not more than 4
per cent', against 4.5 per cent in the previous two years, reflecting
uncertainties that grip the economy. Mr S. Venkitaramanan, the bank
governor, said yesterday that the difficult balance of payments situation,
and the consequent disruption in the flow of imported inputs, will slow
industrial growth, although agriculture is expected to maintain its growth
rate.
Cash deposits for opening letters of credit for certain categories of
imports are now fixed at a stiff 200 per cent, up by half, to ease pressure
on foreign exchange reserves. The World Bank has convened a meeting of donor
countries in Washington on May 1 to provide emergency aid to India.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Middle East: West to build up military forces in north
Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INCREASING number of western governments prepared yesterday to reinforce
their military presence in Iraq, Turkey and Iran as part of the
international effort to save the lives of Kurdish refugees.
Iraq, meanwhile, formally asked the United Nations to take control of the
'safe havens' being established by US forces in northern Iraq.
Britain is to send the 29 Commando Regiment of the Royal Artillery to the
Turkey-Iraq border to join other elements of 3 Commando Brigade, defence
sources say. They will take 105mm guns which can be slung under a Chinook
helicopter.
US defence officials confirmed that the US had sent a naval battle group,
including the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, from the Red Sea to the
Mediterranean as a warning to Iraq not to interfere with the refugee
operation.
In Paris yesterday, Mr Tom King, the British defence secretary, agreed with
Mr Pierre Joxe, his French counterpart to instruct their military staff to
look into the possibility of extending refugee operations further east
towards the border with Iran.
Iraqi forces have remained in the northern Iraqi town of Zakho, defying US
orders to move away and increasing tension in the area around the sites of
the proposed refugee camps.
'Intimidation levels are really growing,' US Marine Staff Sergeant Lee
Tibbetts told reporters at Silopi on the Turkish side of the border. 'It's a
very, very tricky situation. I'm telling you, it's getting wild over there.'
It is estimated that hundreds of refugees are still dying each day in the
mountains despite the increased flow of international aid, and US officials
are hoping to start moving people back to their homes or to the camps in
Iraq in the next few days. Several armies have started to contribute to the
relief effort.
French paratroopers have set up an outpost near Zakho; Chancellor Helmut
Kohl of Germany said yesterday that German troops would build a refugee camp
in northern Iran; Spain is expected to send 500 soldiers to the area within
a week, and Norway is considering a US request to send troops; Canadian,
Belgian, Dutch and Italian troops are also involved. The Iraqi government,
while criticising the US-led relief effort in Iraq as an infringement of the
country's sovereignty, has not so far intervened militarily and continues to
negotiate with Kurdish opposition leaders and to talk of political reforms.
Yesterday the Iraqi news agency reported that the ruling Revolutionary
Command Council had decreed that the cabinet would take on constitutional
powers previously reserved for President Saddam Hussein.
The decision by Kurdish organisations to begin negotiations with Mr Saddam's
regime has been sharply criticised by other opposition groups which say he
cannot be trusted.
In the south, Shia Moslems - whose uprising in early March was crushed by
government forces - continue to announce guerrilla attacks.
The Iranian news agency yesterday quoted refugees arriving from southern
Iraq as saying opposition forces clash nightly with Republican Guards in
Shia Moslem areas. Fighting over the previous two nights took place in
Basra, Tanumah and Qurnah, with a number of government soldiers killed and
military equipment destroyed, the agency said.

FT  24 APR 91 / De Klerk urges UK business to back economic launch pad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT F W de Klerk yesterday offered South Africa's opposition parties
'a voice' in decision-making during the transition to a new constitution and
urged British businessman to help South Africa become an economic 'launching
pad' for the region.
In two keynote speeches Mr de Klerk vigorously proclaimed the emergence of a
'new South Africa', called for an end to economic sanctions, painted a
vision of a prosperous post-apartheid southern Africa, and defended his
efforts to end political violence in the country.
Mr de Klerk made clear in a speech at the Royal Institute for International
Affairs that the ruling National Party envisaged an important post-apartheid
role for itself. 'My government is committed to the sharing of power,' he
said, but added: 'and wholly opposed to surrendering it unconditionally.'
Earlier in the day he also firmly rejected the African National Congress's
call for an interim government.
He went part of the way towards meeting their demand, however, when he said:
'We are prepared to consider certain transitional arrangements at both the
legislative and the executive levels in order to give the leaders of the
various negotiating parties a voice in the formulation of important policy
decisions.'
At a press conference at the start of the day, Mr de Klerk argued that
political reform had to be be underpinned by a vibrant economy that would in
part depend on the lifting of sanctions and new investment capital from
abroad.
'We are now positioned for . . . an economic take-off provided that the
necessary investment is made and the necessary industrialisation takes
place,' he said.
'We don't ask for handouts, we don't ask for donations,' he continued: 'We
ask that all impediments be removed and then we have no doubt that we will
get the flow of private sector investment because of the opportunities that
our economy . . . offers to them.'
Mr de Klerk's economic message was taken up again later in the day during an
address to the Institute of Directors. After calling for a restoration of
sporting links with Britain, he spoke of the potential of southern Africa.
He warned that 'economic growth and constitutional reform must be mutually
reinforcing' saying that 'unless the pressing problems of poverty and the
unemployed are addressed, elegant constitutional models will be of little
avail.'
Mr de Klerk met for the first time Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour Party leader,
who afterwards said it was still too soon to lift sanctions.

<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the first long-term contracts for the reconstruction of Kuwait seems
set to be awarded to Waste Management, the largest waste services company in
the US.
Chicago-based Waste Management looks likely to be given one of the world's
biggest clean-up jobs - clearing the debris left by the Iraqis from the
streets of Kuwait City. So far, the Kuwaiti authorities have awarded mainly
short-term emergency contracts, but Mr George Villasana, Waste Management's
vice-president for the Middle East, said he was in the final stages of
negotiating a one-year contract.
Immediately after the defeat of Iraq, Waste Management crossed into Kuwait
with 30 vehicles and 60 labourers and began to clean up a suburb of Kuwait
City, even though it then had no contract from the Kuwaiti authorities. The
company has since been awarded a month-long contract worth about Dollars 4m
(Pounds 2.2m) to clean part of Kuwait. It has brought about 450 workers,
mainly from the Indian sub-continent, into Kuwait to do this.
Mr Villasana said he was now negotiating a year-long contract worth well
over Dollars 10m to clean the majority of Kuwait City, including almost all
the central districts. The rest of the work will be divided between five
Saudi companies.
The company will have to demolish pill boxes and clear away burnt-out cars.
Mr Villasana said he aimed to return the streets to a semblance of normality
within two months.

FT  24 APR 91 / Pollution challenge for Japan's car culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Environment Agency has challenged the country's powerful automotive
lobby by calling on citizens to review their use of cars and to place
greater reliance on sea and rail transport for domestic freight haulage.
The targeting of trucks and cars as a growing source of Japan's air
pollution problems is a particular embarrassment for the car industry, which
has recently embraced environmental themes in domestic advertising
campaigns.
The Japanese cabinet yesterday approved a white paper from the agency, which
argued for increased use of electric and methanol cars, and concluded that
carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide problems will not improve unless there is
less reliance on cars.
Japan's car makers have been leaders in improving fuel efficiency and
reducing emission levels, but the Environment Agency suggested that a more
fundamental change needs to be made to the country's car culture.
Mr Toshiro Kojima, the agency's director of planning, said said the tax
structure should be revised to encourage environmentally friendly forms of
transport.
He said that the increased use of diesel trucks had contributed to pollution
problems, and haulage companies would be reluctant to trade-in their diesels
while that fuel remains about 30 per cent cheaper than petrol.
'Many trucking companies are small or medium in size, and owners don't want
to discard their present trucks. We have to provide some tax incentives to
change this situation,' Mr Kojima said.
The proposals must be approved by the more influential Ministry of
International Trade and Industry and Transport Ministry before legislation
can be drafted. The latter has made clear it will oppose changes that would
put haulage companies at any disadvantage

FT  24 APR 91 / The Middle East: Baker seeks Soviet help on peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES BAKER, the US secretary of state, is to make an unscheduled visit
to the Soviet Union today to seek closer co-ordination in his efforts to
revive the stalled Middle East peace process.
Washington is looking to Moscow to help it build momentum for the peace
effort. A US plan envisages Soviet co-sponsorship of a regional peace
conference as an opening to direct talks between Israel and the Arabs.
Mr Baker, currently in Damascus, flies to the Caucusus spa town of
Kislovodsk today for a meeting tomorrow with Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, his
Soviet counterpart. Mr Baker is expected to discuss under what circumstances
Moscow would be prepared to normalise relations with Israel, suspended
during the 1967 six-day war.
Mr Baker has been pushing for 'confidence-building' measures on both the
Arab and Israeli sides pending a formal resumption of peace efforts. Moscow
says it will resume full diplomatic ties with Israel once the Israelis agree
to participate in an international conference on the Middle East. A
spokesman for Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, said Mr Baker
had advised that he would follow up his Soviet discussions at a meeting with
Mr Shamir on Friday.
Mr Baker, whose latest Middle East peace shuttle - his third in six weeks -
is aimed at drawing Israel and the Arabs into direct talks, has not made
conspicuous progress. But neither the Arabs, including the Palestinians, nor
Israel has rejected his peace conference proposal. The Arab side is urging
the US to exert real pressure on Israel to co-operate in a genuine peace
effort.
Mr Baker has been careful to avoid publicly criticising Israel, but there
may come a point in the next few weeks when Washington will be obliged to
use additional leverage with the Israelis.
Mr Baker is also likely to discuss the problems surrounding the holding of a
US-Soviet summit - - a summit which the Nato countries have said will not be
held until the Soviet Union agrees to observe clauses in the conventional
forces reduction (CFE) treaty which Nato says it is presently flouting,
writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
This includes the redesignation of army divisions as marines to escape the
terms of the treaty, and moving tanks east of the Urals.
However, Mr Vitaly Churkin, the foreign ministry spokesman, said yesterday
that 'the CFE problems are ones that we both want resolved before the summit
will take place. A solution can be found and I don't think it is far away.
As far as we are concerned a summit should be held by June.'

FT  24 APR 91 / Poland to keep grip on money supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Polish government has committed itself to maintaining tight controls on
money supply this year in return for credits of Dollars 1.6bn over three
years, according to a letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund.
The letter - accepted last week by the IMF's Board of Management - shows
that Poles can expect an additional Dollars 325m loan to cover the increased
costs of oil imports this year.
A quarter of the Dollars 1.6bn IMF loan is to be used cover the costs of a
debt reduction agreement Poland is seeking with 400 or so western banks, to
which it owes Dollars 11bn.
The upper limit on Poland's new foreign borrowing this year is set at
Dollars 1.5bn and, despite an expected fall in the rate of growth of exports
and higher import costs, foreign currency reserves are to grow by Dollars
700m.
The letter also promises to keep Poland's present dollar/zloty exchange rate
'as one of the main points of' the government's anti-inflation strategy.
Domestic money supply is to grow in nominal terms by 43 per cent this year
against a 36 per cent forecast inflation rate. Wages in state owned
industries are to be permitted to rise by no more than 60 per cent of the
increase in prices. Should the inflation rate increase more than expected
then these controls will be tightened.
The budget deficit is to be no higher than Zl 6,000bn or 0.5 per cent of
GDP, while the supply of credit to the rest of the economy is to grow in
real terms by 19 per cent.
Poland's stock exchange saw trading in shares from the Krosno glass works
suspended yesterday when sellers exceeded buyers. Under the rules the price
will be fixed 10 per cent below last week's to await the next session in
seven days time.

FT  24 APR 91 / Kohl lends support to Berlin as new seat of government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday pledged his support for Berlin as Germany's
future seat of government.
He said a move to Berlin, already the official capital, would need 10 to 15
years to complete and Bonn should retain a number of important ministries,
including defence.
The chancellor's surprise decision will boost Berlin's chances of again
becoming the seat of government. Before his announcement, Bonn was thought
to be favoured by a slim majority of members in the Bundestag, the lower
house of parliament, and by most of the west German Lander (states).
It was decided yesterday that the Bundestag will conduct a free vote on the
issue on June 20. The Bundesrat, the upper house, will vote the following
day.
Mr Kohl, trying to regain the political initiative after his party's defeat
in a state election on Sunday, said a government in Berlin would be in a
better position to help overcome the division between the two parts of
Germany.
The announcement may help to boost Mr Kohl's flagging popularity in east
Germany where many voters equate a pro-Berlin view with a vote of confidence
in the east. The timing of his announcement was probably determined by last
Sunday's election in Rhineland-Palatinate. The state borders on Bonn, and Mr
Kohl would not have wanted to make his views clear before the votes were
cast.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the pro-Bonn,
Bavarian-based Christian Social Union, said he regretted the announcement
and insisted that he had no money available to finance the move, costed at
anything between DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) and DM100bn.
Mr Waigel said he would have preferred a compromise, dividing functions
between the two cities.

CONCERTED DOLLAR sales by European central banks and weak economic news from
the US yesterday took some of the steam out of the dollar's rise.
Eleven central banks, spearheaded by the German Bundesbank, took action to
support the D-Mark with large bouts of dollar sales around midday in
European trading.
The German currency, stricken by domestic political shocks and economic
uncertainty, has been the main victim of the dollar. The US unit's rise has
quickened as signs of an emerging economic recovery have rapidly followed
the end of the Gulf war.
Traders reported that the central banks of Finland, Norway and Denmark as
well as the UK, Italy and France were selling dollars, pushing down the US
currency about 2 1/2 pfennigs in Europe.
The action possessed an element of surprise. The markets had to begun to
believe that the Bundesbank was against intervention while the Federal
Reserve was content with the level of US interest rates.
There was no apparent trigger point for the intervention but the banks were
thought to have been spurred by the currency's French fixing at DM1.7580,
the 16-month high it set on Monday.
The attempt to cap the dollar was aided by news that there was an
unexpectedly large 6.2 per cent drop in new orders for US manufactured
durable goods last month.
Analysts said the intervention was likely to have only a very limited
effect. Further dollar strength and D-Mark weakness were in store.
In New York, the dollar closed at DM1.7435, after finishing at DM1.7420 in
London, where it had closed at Dollars 1.766 on Monday.
On Wall Street the economic news, and comments by the Fed chairman about
interest rate policy, had a damping effect on share prices after a string of
strong first-quarter company results spurred a modest recovery. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average closed 2.73 higher at 2,930.45.

FT  24 APR 91 / New council tax may set stage for autumn poll: Two out of
three households will be better off says government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday signalled a return to the political offensive in
the run up to the general election with the claim that its new
property-based council tax would leave two out of three households better
off.
As Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, formally administered
the last rites to the poll tax in the House of Commons, cabinet colleagues
predicted that the stage was set for an autumn election.
Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, greeted the announcement
with the pledge that: 'We now have the opportunity, which we intend to
seize, to go on the attack'. Another senior minister said: 'We have not only
shot the fox but we have buried it six feet under'.
The details of the council tax - which will be levied on the capital value
of houses and flats slotted into seven nationally-set bands - marked the
final break with the policy which Mrs Margaret Thatcher had once dubbed her
flagship.
An avalanche of figures for every local authority in England, Scotland and
Wales suggested that two out of three households would face bills of less
than Pounds 400 a year if the new system were in place this year. The claims
were fiercely rejected by Labour, which said the new system would be
impractical and unfair.
Local authority associations were split, with praise from the
Conservative-controlled Association of District Councils balanced by sharp
criticism from the Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities.
Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's shadow environment spokesman, said that the
government's proposals meant that the poll tax would remain at least until
1993. He said that Labour's 'fair rates' plan would bring quicker and bigger
savings for the voters.
The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation described the government's
timetable as 'tight'.
Mr Heseltine confirmed that properties would be classified in seven bands -
from the cheapest, worth less than Pounds 40,000, to the most expensive
valued at over Pounds 160,000.
The valuations would be contracted out to private companies but overseen by
the Inland Revenue's valuation office. Households in the lowest band would
pay about two-thirds the amount of those in the the middle band - based on
the average property value in England of Pounds 80,000.
At the other end of the scale those in the highest band would pay about
two-thirds more. The key elements of the tax would apply also to Scotland
and Wales, although there might be technical differences.
The illustrative figures produced by Mr Heseltine - hotly contested by Mr
Gould - indicated that the new tax would bring an average bill for the
cheapest property with two adults of Pounds 200 this year against Pounds 668
for one in the highest band.
The environment secretary confirmed that single-person households would
receive a 25 per cent discount, an element designed to reduce the burden on
elderly people living alone.
The decision to base the tax on the assumption of two-person properties was
attacked by Labour, however, as a political fudge designed to placate
supporters of the poll tax within the government's own ranks.
Ministers conceded that the new system would redistribute the burden of
local taxation from the north of England to more affluent areas in the
south. Households in many Tory marginal constituencies in the North West
will be among the main beneficiaries. The political calculation is that
although Tory voters in the south will be the main losers, the ceiling on
the amount that councils will be allowed to levy from each of the seven
bands will cushion the impact.
Mr Heseltine - who also published details of his plan to set up a local
government commission to lead a move towards the creation of single-tier
authorities - added that the government would retain its powers to cap
high-spending authorities.
While the key points of the new local tax are not negotiable in a
consultation period which is due to last until June, the government is far
more open to suggestions on the future structure of local government.
Mr Patten will signal his determination to regain the political initiative
in the run-up to the general election at a press conference early this
morning.
Ministers believe that the proposals may have come too late to have a
decisive impact on next month's local elections, and most have all but ruled
out a June general election.
Most appear convinced, however, that with the poll tax behind them and
further falls in inflation and mortgage rates expected over the next few
months, Mr John Major should be in a position to call an election in the
autumn.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
COUNCIL TAX - MAIN POINTS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
A council tax will replace the poll tax in April 1993.
It will reflect the capital value of a property occupied by two adults
and give a 25 per cent discount to single people.
Property will be valued in seven bands based on value.
Payment in the top band will be limited to 2.5 times that of the bottom
band.
There will be a single bill for each household.
Poor people will be protected by discounts.
There will be no minimum contribution.
Second homes will receive a discount of 50 per cent.

FT  24 APR 91 / End of recession in sight chancellor tells directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the Chancellor, yesterday tried to convince a sceptical
and occasionally critical audience of 3,000 executives that an end to the
recession was in sight.
He told the Institute of Directors' annual convention at London's Royal
Albert Hall he expected a recovery in output - 'albeit relatively slowly at
first' - in the second half of the year.
He believed his first budget and the recent reductions in interest rates
would help pave the way for an improvement in business optimism. The
government, he stressed, was on course to achieve a sharp and sustained
reduction in inflation, although unemployment would continue to rise after
conditions began to improve.
The chancellor sat down to respectable applause but immediately found
himself on the defensive in a question-and-answer session. .
He denied that ministers were 'going soft' on the need to control public
expenditure and reaffirmed their determination to cut personal taxes in the
medium-term.
After Mr Lamont left, the government's handling of the economy came under
heavy fire from sections of a traditionally supportive gathering which
appeared still to be in mourning for Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, led the criticism, claiming that
Britain's business renaissance had been 'torpedoed by runaway inflation'.
Governments, he said, should be expected to deliver zero inflation but they
were too often prepared to fuel it to win elections.
He added: 'This awful recession . . . is a failure of government economic
management. It is a government failure, not market failure'.
He attacked the government for failing to cut income tax further. The 20p
target had 'moved from the realm of commitment and conviction to 'jam
tomorrow' rhetoric'.
Mr Robert Horton, chairman of British Petroleum, expressed surprise and
regret that after 12 years in power the government still had to make the
conquering of inflation its first priority. But he stressed that government
alone was not to blame. Management had often 'let free enterprise down'.
The tussle later transferred to the Commons, where Mr Neil Kinnock, the
Labour leader, taunted Mr John Major, the prime minister, with Mr Morgan's
remarks. He said the IoD also realised the recession was 'hand-made in
Downing Street'. As a former chancellor, the prime minister had to bear 'a
special, personal burden of guilt'.
Mr Major dismissed the accusation. Far from 'flattening' the economy, the
government was flattening inflation and interest rates, he said.

FT  24 APR 91 / Beazer plans debt cut by floating UK business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEAZER, the heavily-borrowed construction and building materials group,
yesterday announced plans to float its UK businesses and then sell up to
half the shares in the new company for up to Pounds 250m.
Mr John Matthews, chief executive, said the plan would require the approval
of shareholders, the stock exchange and the group's bankers.
Funds from the share issue would be used to reduce Beazer's large US
borrowings - most of which were raised to finance the Dollars 1.7bn
acquisition of Koppers cement and aggregates business in March 1988.
If the plan went ahead, the share sale would be likely to take place between
June and September of this year. The new company, to be called Beazer
Europe, would include all the group's UK housing, contracting and commercial
property businesses.
It has not been decided whether to offer shares in the new company solely to
existing shareholders or to make them available also to new investors.
The UK businesses, which have an estimated net asset value of about Pounds
400m, generated Pounds 72.7m out of total group operating profits of Pounds
189.8m in the 12 months to June 30, 1990. On the stock market, Beazer's
shares closed 4p higher at a new high for the year of 185p after the
announcement.
This gave the group a total stock market value of just under Pounds 500m
compared with an implied price tag under the flotation plans of about the
same amount for the UK businesses alone.
Mr Matthews said the group believed its current share price substantially
undervalued the group's businesses. Shareholders were likely to achieve
better value by splitting the company, he said.  The proposals would leave
the group owning a large US cement, concrete and aggregate business and
maintaining a controlling interest in its former UK operations. Beazer's
last annual accounts, for the year to June 30, 1990, showed net debts of
Pounds 880.5m mostly in the US. This compared with shareholders' funds of
about Pounds 1bn.
The group, which last month announced a 31 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 43.2m during the six months to the end of December, has said that
net debt should be reduced to about Pounds 750m by the end of June this year
following a series of disposals and joint ventures in the US.
Beazer said that, at the last count, about 40 per cent of its shares were
held by US investors. Analysts believe the proportion of US investors is now
nearer half.
Mr Matthews said the group would have to think carefully about where it
would be domiciled should it end up with its core assets and the majority of
its shareholders in the US.

FT  24 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPTIONS market was subdued yesterday as dealers waited for an
announcement from the London Traded Options Market and the London
International Financial Futures Exchange on the merger of the two markets.
None was immediately forthcoming, but the market was alive with speculation
about its future. Floor dealers were resigned to some upheaval in the
depressed traded options market, but reports of the plan to move all equity
options on to a screen-based system still caused surprise.
Turnover remained depressed on the options market with total business just
24,467 contracts. Analysts reckon LTOM needs 30,000 contracts traded per day
to break even.
Shell July 550 call options were actively traded as the shares advanced
following strong figures by US oil majors. A total of 2,201 options changed
hands, equivalent to 2.2m shares.
Marks and Spencer traded 1,547, mostly April 260 calls. Hanson was boosted
by activity in May 220 puts.
On the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract finished 21 points
up at 2,527. But its premium to the spot index ended at just 21 points,
against the 30 points brokers estimate is necessary to take account of
futures dividend payments and financing cost.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt waits for the dark days to
pass - Andrew Fisher looks for the good news which might inspire the German
stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR has been fairly dispiriting for the German stock market. While the
west German economy remains strong, its growth is slowing down. In east
Germany, the dismantling of the old communist system is causing immense
industrial and social strains. And recession abroad, coupled in the case of
the US with a rising dollar, has bit deeply into export earnings.
On top of all this, the political climate has turned sour with the defeat of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party (CDU) in his home state
of Rhineland-Palatinate.
As well as demonstrating that voters had lost confidence in the government's
handling of affairs after unity - they certainly disliked tax increases
after promises that these could be avoided - the state election also removed
its majority in the upper house of Parliament (Bundesrat).
Thus the Bonn cabinet could find life tougher in the months ahead, since the
Bundesrat has the power of veto over legislation, including tax.
Yet the stock market outlook is by no means all gloomy. Some analysts feel
the time may be ripe for foreign institutional investors to pay more
attention to the German market, since it has so clearly failed to keep pace
with other exchanges.
'People are underweight in a market which has underperformed,' says Ms
Katrin Kandell, an analyst at the London office of Sal. Oppenheim, the
German bank. 'They are starting to look at 1992. There has to be some
positive news in the next six months.'
What could that be? Indications of a bottoming out in the east German
economic slump could be one element. Another could be evidence that the
knocks which west German exporters have taken over the past year are
becoming less painful.
Degab, the investment analysis offshoot of Deutsche Bank, recently forecast
that German corporate earnings would rise by around 8 per cent next year
after declines of 5 per cent in 1990 and 1 per cent in 1991; in 1989, they
grew by 13 per cent.
Two sectors which have been especially buffeted by the problems on export
markets, chemicals and cars, are expected to show a marked improvement next
year, while the surge in retail and consumer companies' profits should ease
and construction, helped by the rebuilding of east Germany, should remain
strong.
Germany's construction companies are currently enjoying a prolonged boom,
with business in the west also vigorous. A study by the Frankfurt office of
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK stockbrokers, shows that seven out of the
German companies with the best liquidity ratios are from this sector. They
also have valuable land and property assets, which are considerably
understated in their balance sheets.
BZW's German Company Handbook gives a good illustration of the financial
solidity of German corporations. Out of 138 companies covered, 53 have no
gearing at all and only 21 have any net debt.
Moreover, 58 of them finance all capital spending through cash flow. Thus
those with heavy future commitments in east Germany, such as RWE and Veba,
the energy concerns, have plenty of scope for internal funding.
Mr Harry Christopoulos, a BZW analyst, says: 'German companies have lots of
assets and low gearing.' Also, adds Ms Kandell, more of them are using their
property port-folios for development projects, thus unlocking some of their
value.
Her hope is that German companies, prompted by the demands of east German
investment or the desire to ward off unfriendly takeovers, will start to pay
more attention to their share prices. At present, they can lower their tax
bills by salting away profits in reserves and thus understating earnings.
One day, though, EC tax harmonisation may change all that.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent registers a
progressive recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES showed a modestly progressive recovery yesterday, measured by
half-hourly gains on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index which an improved start
for Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT recovered nearly all of Monday's losses as domestic institutions
and officialdom reconsidered the implications of the CDU's Rhineland
Palatinate election defeat on Sunday, and as the market digested results
from Daimler and Siemens (on Monday) and Hoechst yesterday.
There was also some speculation in industrials after Germany's
constitutional court ruled that compensation should be paid to former owners
of east German property seized under 1945-49 Soviet military occupation.
Reversing the pattern of Monday's declines, a modest rise in the FAZ index,
5.73 to 676.76, was followed by a 25.14, or 1.6 per cent gain in the DAX to
1,597.05 at the close. Volume rose from DM5bn to DM6bn, reflecting domestic
institutional buying.
Daimler led carmakers up with a DM15 rise to DM695.50. Ms Barbara Altmann,
of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said buyers were more interested in the higher
dollar, and the big exporter's recovery prospects, than last year's fall in
profits. Siemens rose DM14.20 to DM597.50 although some pundits were
forecasting lower profits for the current year on Monday.
Hoechst held its DM13 dividend, and rose DM7.80 to DM264.50. Its former
parent, IG Farben, the shell of the giant which grouped Germany's chemical
industry before and during World War II, rose DM3.20 or 12.4 per cent to
DM29 on the land compensation court ruling.
PARIS started the new account on a firm footing but turnover showed no
significant improvement, which raised doubts that the recovery would
persist. The CAC-40 index rose 14.63 or 0.8 per cent to close at 1,781.83 on
volume estimated at around FFr2bn.
Alcatel, which lost ground towards the close of the previous account,
recovered FFr9 to FFr577 with 322,515 shares traded, and Peugeot added FFr7
to FFr550 with 152,925 shares exchanged. Among the second-liners, Moulinex,
which is thought to have a rights issue in prospect, jumped FFr8 or 6.8 per
cent to FFr125.50 with 76,400 shares traded. Carrefour went against the
market, losing FFr6 to FFr3,720 following its unconvincing general meeting
on Monday.
MILAN had a repeat performance of the previous day, with continued
profit-taking in the insurance and banking sectors and further gains in
shares controlled by Mr Carlo de Benedetti. The Comit index fell 2.82 to
593.17 in volume estimated at slightly above Monday's meagre L138bn.
Mediobanca fell L25 to L16,190 and Generali lost L200 to L37,900.
Cir, Mr De Benedetti's holding company, gained L50 to L2,660 in spite of a
one-day delay in the talks with Mr Silvio Berlusconi on resolving their
dispute for control of Mondadori. Olivetti, the computer manufacturer,
advanced L25 to L3,870.
ZURICH moved on the Frankfurt market, the Credit Suisse index closing 4.8
higher at 554.8. There was some foreign buying but volume, overall, held at
a modest level, reflecting the lack of movement in interest rates, and
gyrations in the dollar after central bank intervention.
Among chemicals, Ciba-Geigy registered rose SFr70 to SFr2,510. The company
said that the effects of the strong dollar will not show until the second
half of this year.
STOCKHOLM recovered from a weak opening to close mostly unchanged after a
choppy session. Share prices rose, and domestic interest rates eased, on
relief that the revised national 1991/92 budget did not contain any
surprises. The Affarsvarlden general index advanced 8.6 to 1,066.7 and
volume rose to SKr379m from SKr264m. Ericsson was the most active share. Its
free B shares rose SKr6 to SKr198 in volume of SKr55m.
SKF free B's were SKr0.50 lower at SKr92.50 after the company reported a 92
per cent decline in pre-tax profit in the first quarter to SKr59m, at the
low end of expectations.
MADRID rose and the stronger dollar gave an extra lift to issues with ADR
facilities. Repsol closed Pta45 higher at Pta2,600, Endesa gained Pta25 to
Pta2,435 but Telefonica put on a mere Pta3 to Pta996. The general index
closed 1.92 higher at 281.50 in low volume of Pta9.9bn, after Monday's
Pta15.4bn.
AMSTERDAM was led higher by Royal Dutch which briefly hit an all-time high
of Fl 159.10 before closing Fl 2.30 better at Fl 158.40. The equity market
was also boosted by the good reception of the new 15-year government bond.
The CBS tendency index closed 1.3 or 1.4 per cent firmer at 95.4.
OSLO continued its slide in moderate trading, with shipping the weakest
sector as the all-share index fell 2.41 to 472.53.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recoups losses on
futures-related buying
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES fell initially on news of a leasing company in financial
trouble, but staged a recovery later on futures-related buying. Activity
remained dull ahead of the Golden Week holidays next week, when the market
will be open only on Tuesday to Thursday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225-share average closed up 254.56 at 26,491.57 after losing 305
points on Monday. The index started on a weak note and recorded a day's low
of 26,078.31 on reports that Shizushin Lease had filed for court protection
under the bankruptcy law, as a result of its extensive loans to faltering
real estate companies. Investment trusts came in as buyers at that level and
the index reached a day's high of 26,568.89.
Volume picked up to 360m shares from 250m as some investors were encouraged
by expectations of Y7bn worth of cash coming into the market from new
investment trust funds due to be set up at the end of the week.
Declines still led gains at the close by 562 to 392, with 176 issues
unchanged, but the Topix index of all first section stocks put on 6.99 to
1,982.52. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.65 to 1,501.76.
Mr Yoichi Kamina at SG Warburg said there was no evident change in
sentiment, and buying was for technical reasons. 'We expect the market to go
up after Golden Week, so it is not surprising that some investors wanted to
buy at the lower levels,' he added.
Mr John Courtney at WI Carr said investors were cautious, and did not expect
a big market move until publication of corporate results which could give it
new direction.
Focus moved back to large-capital stocks, depressed recently by the interest
rate uncertainty. Kobe Steel rallied Y13 to Y552 and Nippon Steel firmed Y1
to Y472.
Companies which were reported to be creditors of Shizushin Lease lost ground
in the morning but recovered in the afternoon. Mitsui Trust Bank opened Y20
lower at Y1,450, but closed up Y40 at Y1,510. Tokio Marine &amp; Fire, which
holds a 5 per cent stake in Shizushin, lost Y20 at the opening but closed up
Y10 at Y1,350.
Nippon Yakin Kogyo fell Y40 to Y1,000 on profit-taking. The issue has risen
recently on buy recommendations from major Japanese brokers, on the back of
strong earnings for the current year.
High-priced shares which had been popular on favourable earnings forecasts
lost ground as interest turned to big board issues. Family Mart, the
convenience store chain, receded Y200 to Y10,600, and Keyence, the measuring
equipment maker, lost Y200 to Y16,500.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 287.61 to 29,269.64, its fourth decline in a
row, on volume of 30.9m shares. Investors who had bought shares for the
short term took profits.
New Japan Chemical rose Y30 to Y1,180. The company expects sales of its
additive which raises the transparency of polypropylene to double to Y3bn
for the current year.
Roundup
MAJOR EXTERNAL influences on the Pacific Basin, Wall Street overnight and
Tokyo, were in conflict yesterday and a number of markets reflected this.
HONG KONG, which dipped to an intraday low of 3,549, was pushed briefly into
positive territory by bargain hunting, but closed with the Hang Seng index a
net 12.85 lower at 3,569.64. Turnover eased from HKDollars 1.41bn to
HKDollars 1.28bn.
Property shares and the commercial and industrial sector posted moderate
losses, while banks and utilities were narrowly mixed.
Traders were keeping an eye on the airport issue, where there is now the
debate that a private sector solution to the stalemate in negotiations
between the Colony and China might be bad for the Hong Kong government but
good for the stock market.
SEOUL, which tested its January 4 low for 1991 of 614.60 on the composite
index with a 12.72 or 2 per cent fall on Monday, rebounded yesterday with a
jump of 22.23 or 3.6 per cent to 637.84. Turnover climbed too, but it was
still moderate after a rise from Won91.6bn to Won142.3bn.
The market has suffered from tight monetary conditions, but there was an
unofficial report of lower inflation from the Bank of Korea yesterday, and
subsequent talk of a loosening in monetary policy.
AUSTRALIA saw turnover rise from ADollars 202m to ADollars 233m as the All
Ordinaries index eased 2.4 to 1,510.5; a parcel of 5.66m shares in Advance
Bank Australia - 9 per cent of its share capital - was sold at ADollars 5.20
a share by ANZ Bank. Advance closed down 10 cents at ADollars 5.10.
TAIWAN retreated 1.6 per cent and broke a five-day winning run, the weighted
index sliding 91.91 to 5,732.09. BANGKOK followed Wall Street down, the SET
index losing 15.71 to 893.19.
KARACHI registered record volume of 4.8m shares, up from 3.9m last Sunday
when the KSE index rose 24 to 1,675. A KSE spokesman said an additional
650,000 shares were traded after hours following news of further government
initiatives to boost exports and trim red tape.

FT  24 APR 91 / Money Markets: Europe rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATES were steady in Europe yesterday after the German Bundesbank
set an unchanged fixed rate at a one-month securities repurchase agreement
tender and the Bank of Spain left its money market intervention rate
unchanged.
Wholesale rates in London were also stable as hopes of lower bank base rates
received the second setback in two day's. Monday's news of high retail sales
in March was followed yesterday by a larger than expected UK current account
deficit in the same month. Call money in Frankfurt was unchanged at 8.85 per
cent following the Bundesbank's offer of a securities repurchase agreement
tender at a fixed rate of 8.60 per cent. Dealers expect the supply of funds
to roughly match the DM10.8bn draining from the banking system today as an
earlier facility expires.
In Madrid the Bank of Spain supplied liquidity to the domestic money market
at an unchanged 13.5 per cent at the regular thrice-monthly repurchase
tender for central bank certificates.
In London three-month interbank was steady at 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent and
12-month money was unchanged at 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent.
On Liffe short sterling futures maintained a recent weaker trend. June
delivery opened unchanged at 88.64, but closed at 88.59.
Day-to-day credit remained in short supply on the cash market. The Bank of
England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1,350m, but revised this to
Pounds 1,200m at noon and to Pounds 1,250m in the afternoon. Total help of
Pounds 1,172m was provided.
In early operations the authorities bought Pounds 73m bank bills outright in
band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Before lunch another Pounds 124m bills were
purchased, by way of Pounds 47m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and
Pounds 77m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
In the afternoon Pounds 975m bills were bought, via Pounds 1m Treasury bills
in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent, Pounds 545m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per
cent and Pounds 429m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 7m, with the unwinding of a repurchase
agreement on bills absorbing Pounds 1,374m and bank balances below target
Pounds 130m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 65m to
liquidity and a fall in the note circulation of Pounds 95m.

surpass UK
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY will overtake Britain as Europe's biggest crude oil producer this
year, according to a report issued by Edinburgh-based County NatWest WoodMac
(CNWM), writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Norway's average crude oil and natural gas liquids (Ngl) production will
increase by 13 per cent over last year's level to 1.94m barrels a day.
By comparison, this year Britain will produce an average of 1.85m barrels a
day from offshore fields, a slight increase over the 1990 average level of
1.84m barrels.
Britain's production is hindered by annual maintenance shutdowns in May and
June and a loss of 200,000 barrels a day from the Brent field, where
installation of subsea emergency shutdown valves is taking place.
In the fourth quarter of this year Norwegian crude oil/Ngl production will
surge to around 2.1m barrels a day, its highest level ever, forecast CNWM.
This increase will stem from the coming on stream of the Oseberg North
field, which will produce 100,000 barrels a day of crude oil.

FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin price forecast to rise by
50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIN PRICES will rise by 50 per cent in the next 12 months from the current
low levels which make most of the industry unprofitable, forecasts the
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) research group.
This is a less-optimistic prediction than the Association of Tin Producing
Countries (ATPC) and the EIU admits that there is 'a high probability' that
its forecasts will be wrong because 'at some stage it will no longer be
appropriate for consumers to keep stocks at a bare minimum.
'No one wants to anticipate that moment, but equally no one wants to be left
out once it arrives. When prices do rise, they will rise very sharply,' the
EIU warns in its latest World Commodity Forecasts report.
It predicts that tin prices will move up from an average Dollars 2.53 a lb
in the first quarter this year to Dollars 3.80 in April-June 1992.
Primary tin output will fall by nearly 12 per cent to 159,000 tonnes this
year because of cuts by producers.
Consumption is forecast to slip by 2.7 per cent to 175,500 tonnes, which
would imply a deficit in the west of 12,500 tonnes. Sales from the US
strategic stockpile and imports from the eastern bloc are expected by the
EIU to account for some of the deficit, leaving western stocks to be reduced
by 10,000 tonnes - well below the 13,000 tonnes hoped for by the ATPC.
The EIU expects next year's mine production to recover by more than
consumption - to 162,300 tonnes against consumption of 177,100 tonnes.
Stocks might fall again, by another 7,800 tonnes, the EIU suggests, putting
an upward pressure on prices.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Bank chief hits at settlement
systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYSTEMS for settling securities transactions seldom allow for the transfer
of securities only against payment, whatever they may claim, Mr Pen Kent, an
executive director of the Bank of England, warned yesterday.
Speaking at a conference in London, Mr Kent said that many countries had
improved their settlement systems to meet the requirements laid down by the
G30. Status reports on the level of development in 21 countries around the
world will be produced by the G30 in the next few days, he said.
However, few had succeeded in developing a true system of delivery against
payment, in which cash is released only against the delivery of securities,
and vice versa. This leaves a residual risk in settlement systems which
appear to offer buyers and sellers full security, he said.
'Perfect synchronisation is very difficult to achieve,' Mr Kent warned. 'In
practice, settlement systems may well involve intermediaries explicitly or
implicitly guaranteeing the performance of the principals to overcome timing
inconsistencies.'
Ideally, he said, delivery versus payment should involve real-time transfer
of cash at the time of the trade, with payments being made gross rather than
netted out.
'More work needs to be done on delivery versus payment (DVP). I do not think
most systems do achieve DVP as I have described it,' he said. 'Many systems
exchange stock against some form of payment. Legal title, however, may not
be guaranteed. Payment may not be in immediate good funds. The system may
rely on the good name of an intermediary such as a bank or depository.'
Mr Kent added that regulations which will allow the development of Taurus,
the UK's long-delayed new settlement system, will be published within days.
The delay in the regulations, to be produced by Department of Trade and
Industry, has already meant that the introduction of Taurus has been put off
from October this year to next spring at the earliest.
Mr Kent warned that the regulations, when published, would be long and
detailed, but that they have been designed 'to minimise the changes to
existing legal rights and obligations.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd is closing its US equities operations and laying off
15 per cent of its staff, just a year after hiring a number of top-flight
analysts to set up the business.
The investment banking and securities arm of Britain's Barclays Bank said
yesterday that a detailed review had concluded that 'the cost of building
and maintaining a business in US equities wouldn't produce adequate returns
in the forseeable future.'
A BZW official in New York indicated that, even with the recent upturn in
the securities business, the firm had found it difficult to compete against
established US securities dealers with far greater resources.
She described the venture as an 'opportunistic act which proved untenable'.
The lay-offs affect 60 research, sales and support staff, most of them based
in New York.
The firm emphasised that its international equities business based in New
York will not be affected.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Bonds: C&amp;G steps into sterling floating rate
note sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society stepped into the sterling floating
rate note sector of the international bond market yesterday with a Pounds
125m deal, increased from Pounds 100m, lead managed by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
The deal follows the reopening of the sector by the Woolwich Building
Society last week, after six months during which floating rate funding could
not be sold.
The four-year maturity of yesterday's issue was a year longer than the
Woolwich deal and tested the readiness of investors to lock into this
relatively illiquid market.
Lead managers responded to demands for higher fees from several firms and
offered eight basis points for underwriting, against four basis points last
week. However, several leading houses again declined to participate, arguing
that fees of around 10 basis points would be commensurate with underwriting
risk.
This did not appear to inhibit the progress of the deal however, with the
issuer regarded as one of the few improving credits in the sector. The paper
pays 15 basis points over the three month London interbank offered rate and
was reoffered to investors at the fixed price of 99.69. At this level, the
discounted margin is 24.5 basis points, very close to the return on the
three-year Woolwich deal.
The lead manager reported strong demand from UK institutional investors and
some demand from continental European investors.
Elsewhere, investors anticipating further appreciation of the dollar were
offered two virtually identical Dollars 200m three-year deals from
state-backed European financial institutions.
Credit Local de France came with an issue lead managed by J. P. Morgan
priced to yield 46 basis points over comparable US Treasury securities. Some
hours later, LKB Baden-Wuerttenberg offered paper via Nomura International
at a yield spread of 47 basis points over treasuries.
J Sainsbury, the UK food retailer, is to redeem its outstanding Pounds 150m,
5 per cent convertible capital bond issue on June 24. Investors holding
unconverted bonds can either switch into equity at the conversion price of
Pounds 2.62 or take a redemption payment. Under the redemption clause, the
bonds will be converted into preference shares, which will then be redeemed
at par, plus a premium of 3 per cent.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Treuhand may breach borrowing
limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN OFFICIAL in Bonn yesterday suggested that the Treuhand, the east German
state-backed privatisation agency, was likely to breach its borrowing limit
for 1991, possibly by DM3bn.
The agency, originally set a limit of DM25bn, is under pressure to extend
its financial safety net as the unemployment unleashed by its restructuring
programme becomes more controversial in the east.
The suggestion from Bonn came as the Treuhand confirmed plans to launch the
largest D-Mark commercial paper programme since the market opened at the
beginning of this year.
The DM2bn facility, arranged by Dresdner Bank with Deutsche Bank as
co-arranger, will cover the agency's short and medium-term requirements.
D-Mark commercial paper has only been allowed since the beginning of this
year, when the Bundesbank put aside its previous objections and a change in
law removed the constraint of seeking ministry of finance approval for each
issuance.
In addition to the Treuhand programme, six programmes are already in place
including DM500m for Daimler Benz, Germany's biggest industrial
conglomerate, DM500m for BMW, the car manufacturer and DM250m for Sudzucker,
the sugar company.
Daimler Benz kicked off the market in mid-February and outstandings already
amount to just under DM1bn. Much of the paper has been issued at the very
short end of the market from seven days upwards.
The Treuhand has said it will tap the market in maturities between seven
days and two years. Yesterday's programme marks the first incursion of
another bank as arranger into a market which to date Deutsche Bank,
Germany's largest, had managed to keep to itself. On four of the other six
deals Deutsche had acted as sole dealer as well as arranger. JP Morgan and
Westdeutsche Landesbank are both appointed dealers for the Treuhand.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Intermediaries warned of
tough challenges - FT Conference (European Securities Markets in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY intermediaries operating in the European securities markets face
significant challenges if they are to survive to the end of the decade,
industry executives warned yesterday.
Speaking on the second day of a Financial Times conference on the
development of the European securities markets, Mr Herschel Post, chief
operating officer of Lehman Brothers International, warned that the process
of disintermediation that swept the commercial banking world during the
1980s could come to bear on many securities intermediaries in the coming
years. This included stock exchanges themselves as well as brokers, he said.
Partly as a result of the shifting boundaries in the securities business,
large institutions have already moved to integrate a range of intermediary
functions, from acting as investment managers to being brokers and
principals in securities trades.
This vertical integration would allow them to move resources most
effectively between the different functions to meet opportunities, he said.
Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, member of the board of managing directors of Dresdner
Bank, listed this vertical integration as one of the indispensable
components of any financial intermediary's strategy in the coming years.
Others, he said, were a clear, earnings-related focus on the segments and
geographical areas in which an intermediary plans to operate; a focus on
earnings rather than turnover; and a modern, customer- oriented distribution
system.
Mr Eberstadt added that universal banks, similar to those in Germany, were
best placed to take advantage of deregulation in Europe.
Universal banks do not suffer the same pressures as investment or commercial
banks to constantly try to overcome regulatory hurdles by developing new
financial products, he said.
'These (products) do not necessarily suggest a greater emphasis of a more
rigorous approach to risk management, as is often stated.
'They tie up important resources to circumvent artificially created hurdles,
which are then not available for other, more productive purposes of
financial intermediation.'
Universal banks do not suffer these pressures, since they can switch
resources between commercial and investment banking, he said. 'It is not
difficult to forecast a global trend toward universal banking for the coming
years,' he added.
Responding to a question later, Mr Post said he did not believe investment
business in Europe would concentrate into the hands of a few, large
universal banks.
As had already happened in the US, investors in Europe would come to
understand the benefits of selecting intermediaries on the basis of
performance, and this would lead to more varied choice.
Mr Howard Coates, deputy chairman of BZW equities, said that the challenges
facing intermediaries in Europe were greater than those they faced elsewhere
in the world.
This is because, in addition to the challenges posed by deregulation,
intermediaries had to cope with the problems of dealing in many, often small
local markets, with the same securities often being traded on more than one
market. In addition, cultural and historic differences meant that different
types of investor and issuer demanded a different approach from
intermediaries.
BZW's response to the higher costs and lower income in securities markets
had been in part to focus on higher value products, and in part to pare each
business so that it could survive even in difficult periods.
Different equities, such as French equities, are treated as different
products and given their own profit and loss account, he said. In addition,
BZW now reviews its customers by the profits that the firm generates from
business it does with them.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: ICSA calls for greater
international consultation in securities regulations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The International Councils of Securities Associations (ICSA), which
represents self-regulatory authorities in the leading financial centres,
closed its meeting in London with a call for greater international
consultation in securities regulation, writes Simon London.
The two-day meeting discussed ways of improving the efficiency of
multi-national securities offerings, the detection of malpractice in
cross-border dealings and licensing of securities industry professionals to
work internationally.
One area of concern is the delay in formulating capital adequacy guidelines
for securities houses. Delays were placing securities firms at a competitive
disadvantage, commented Mr Robin Hutton, director-general of the British
Merchant Banking and Securities Houses Association.
Capital adequacy requirements for the securities industry are being examined
by the Basle group of central bank regulators, the European Commission and
the US and Japanese regulatory authorities. However, no guidelines are
expected to be published before the end of this year.

DISPELLING some of the gloom which surrounds the US insurance sector, Chubb
Corporation, the big US property - casualty insurer, yesterday reported a
15.5 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits after tax, at Dollars
128.3m.
The figure included realised investment gains of Dollars 4.2m, compared with
the Dollars 5.2m worth of gains included in the first quarter of 1990.
During the latest quarter, the insurer made a small underwriting profit of
Dollars 7m, compared with a Dollars 7.1m loss in the same period a year
earlier.
Net premiums written on the property and casualty side during the three
months totalled Dollars 737.7m, compared with Dollars 659.4m in the first
quarter of 1990.
Catastrophe losses were marginally lower at Dollars 8.2m, against Dollars
9.3m, while the combined ratio (after dividends to policyholders) fell from
102.1 per cent to 98.8 per cent.
Investment income, meanwhile, rose by 8.2 per cent to Dollars 100.7m, while
Chubb's life and health operations contributed a Dollars 12m profit for the
quarter, compared with Dollars 10.2m a year ago. The only slippage came on
the property front, where the real estate operations saw profits fall from
Dollars 13.1m to Dollars 7.5m.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Hungary to launch convertible
bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY plans to launch convertible bonds on the back of its privatisation
programme, according to the official news agency.
The bonds could be used to buy shares in some of the
companies in Hungary's First Privatisation Programme, Mr Frigyes Harshegyi,
deputy president of the central bank, told the MTI wire service.
The dollar bond issue would take place after companies had been introduced
to the stock exchange.
About 15 of the 20 companies included in the First Privatisation Programme
may be floated on the stock exchange from the middle of the year, according
to officials. They include Hungarhotels, Pannonia and Danubius, Hungary's
three largest hotel companies, Richter Gedeon, the largest pharmaceuticals
manufacturer, and Centrum, an extensive chain of department stores.
The scheme would be an imaginative way of interweaving two important
government aims: servicing Hungary's Dollars 21bn foreign debt, the largest
per capita in eastern Europe; and fuelling investor demand for Hungary's
ambitious privatisation programmes.
But it is unclear how the scheme would mesh with the plans already being
drawn up by advisers hired to privatise the 20 companies in the second half
of 1991. Moreover, the Hungarian government is already planning to issue
bonds convertible into privatised assets in compensation for property
expropriated by the Communists. These, stock exchange officials fear, may
flood the market and quickly trade at a discount.
The idea of issuing convertible bonds is part of the Hungarian National
Bank's effort to return to favour on international money markets.
Hungary recently announced a DM150m bond issue after an DM200m issue last
month was oversubscribed. With the latest issue, the central bank was able
to narrow last month's 250 basis point spread over bund yields.
Mr Harshegyi recently said that Dollars 1bn-worth of bonds would be issued
this year, about three-quarters of that in Japan and Germany.

airline privatisation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPPINE Commercial International Bank is pushing ahead with the
privatisation of Philippine Airlines (PAL), but is waiting for the sale
prospectus and the results of a due diligence review before making a final
decision on the bidding consortium.
A number of parties are known to be interested in acquiring the 60 per cent
of PAL that the government is to put up for sale. They include Northwest
Airlines of the US, JAL of Japan, a consortium led by a Hong Kong company,
and a group headed by PAL pilots. 'Once the prospectus comes out, we will
decide whether to bid, who to bid with and how much to bid,' said Mr Stephen
Cu-Unjieng, PCIB managing director for investment banking.
Mr Feliciano Belmonte, PAL president, said that PAL had incurred a net loss
of 1.5bn pesos (Dollars 54.6m) for the year ended March 1991, mainly due to
heavy foreign exchange losses and increased domestic fuel price costs.
He said the foreign airlines were interested in PAL's trans-Pacific routes,
rather than its current balance sheet. By the end of the year, Mr Belmonte -
who also heads the government pension fund that controls 75 per cent of
equity in Philippine Airlines - disclosed the airline was planning to double
its Manila-US flights to 26 a week.
One of the main obstacles to PAL's successful privatisation is its planned
buy-back of Dollars 175m of Paris Club debts and Dollars 170m of commercial
debts. The Philippines' central bank and the finance department have drafted
an agreement that might resolve the debt issue, Mr Belmonte said.
He said the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the majority
stockholder in PAL and the Philippine Plaza Hotel, has asked for a guarantee
from Allied Kajima (AKL) of Japan foIlowing its purchase of the hotel for
1.5bn pesos.
Mr Belmonte, who is GSIS president and general manager, said AKL has been
asked to pledge as security 100 per cent of the shares to be bought as well
as a mortgage on the hotel, which is being bought with a long-term lease
from GSIS over the land.

<TEXT>
MCI Communications suffered a 21 per cent fall in first - quarter earnings
in the highly competitive US long-distance telephone market, despite record
revenues.
The second largest long-distance carrier earned Dollars 123m, or 48 cents a
share, down from Dollars 156m, or 62 cents, a year ago. Revenues advanced to
just over Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.8bn, but operating income fell to
Dollars 265m from Dollars 283m.
Mr Bert Roberts, president, blamed the decline on the recession and
competitive pressures. He noted that MCI had launched an unusually large
number of services in recent months, notably Friends &amp; Family, which offers
discounts to residential subscribers for frequently-called numbers.
MCI has a 13 per cent share of the long-distance market. Although MCI's
share was boosted by last year's acquisition of Telecom USA, the
fourth-biggest operator, it was expected to have garnered a larger slice of
the market by now.
Mr Courtney Munroe, analyst at Northern Business Information, said MCI's
problems have been compounded by aggressive cost-cutting.
'In trying to improve margins they've cut corners in customer service,' he
said. Recent surveys by NBI indicate that, despite a host of impressive new
services, MCI's image in the marketplace has deteriorated as a result of the
belt-tightening measures.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S two gov-ernment-owned airlines are likely to complete the sale
of significant shareholdings to overseas investors before the end of the
year, airline executives said yesterday.
'We should be able to come to some conclusions within the next two or three
months,' said Mr Ted Harris, chairman of Australian Airlines, the
government-owned domestic carrier.
The government plans to sell 100 per cent of Australian Airlines, of which
40 per cent will be placed with overseas buyers, with a ceiling of 25 per
cent on individual foreign shareholdings.
It also wants to sell 49 per cent of Qantas, the international flag carrier,
of which 35 per cent will be placed with overseas airlines. The balance of
the shares will probably be floated later.
Qantas and Ansett Australia, the domestic airline owned jointly by TNT and
News Corporation, will be barred from buying shares in Australian Airlines.
Both government-owned airlines are to be recapitalised before the sales
go-ahead, probably through the assumption of debt by the government in
return for shares.
The detailed plans for the sales, announced in statements by Mr Ralph
Willis, finance minister, and Mr Kim Beazley, transport minister, are
largely in line with privatisation proposals announced in December.
However, the government rejected a request from the Qantas board for
permission to acquire up to 25 per cent of Australian Airlines to protect
its access to domestic traffic.
Officials said ministers rejected the proposal because it would have
undermined the privatisation of Australian Airlines, and blurred the
division between domestic and international operations.
The decision angered Qantas, which said it would be placed at a competitive
disadvantage to foreign airlines.
'It is difficult to understand why Qantas has been specifically excluded
from participation in any form in domestic aviation in Australia while its
foreign competitors are being encouraged to do just that,' said Mr Bill Dix,
Qantas chairman.
The government's decision to recapitalise the airlines in advance of the
sale of shares will increase their attractiveness to investors by reducing
the high gearing both have incurred as a result of re-equipment programmes.
The extent of the recapitalisation has not been determined, but Mr Beazley
said last year that repairing the airlines' balance sheets would cost around
ADollars 600m (USDollars 465m) for Qantas and ADollars 300m for Australian
Airlines.
Qantas is understood to have had talks with British Airways, Japan Air
Lines, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, of the US, and Garuda, the
Indonesian flag carrier.
The same airlines head the list of potential shareholders in Australian
Airlines, but the government is unlikely to allow airlines to acquire
holdings in both Qantas and Australian.

ISRAEL Chemicals, the country's biggest and most profitable state-owned
industrial group, reported a drop in net profits in 1990 to Dollars 78.2m
from Dollars 86.3m in 1989, a record year for the group.
Sales were up Dollars 76m to Dollars 1.23bn, but a fall in world prices for
potash, Israel Chemicals' core product, a drop in phosphate sales to eastern
Europe, and the shekel's relative strength against foreign currencies were
blamed for the reduced earnings.
Net return on capital was 14 per cent, maintaining Israel Chemicals'
traditional position as the leading performer among the state's industrial
holdings.
The group, which exploits Israel's main natural resources from the Dead Sea
area, has been slated for privatisation for some time, but a planned private
placement of a majority stake with foreign investors was blocked by
political objections.
A partial flotation on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is the preferred option
of most ministers, although no decision has been taken.
Israel Chemicals now relies heavily on international markets.
Last year, exports were up by 7 per cent at Dollars 646m, a little over half
of total sales. The drop in earnings came mainly from two of the group's
core Israeli production companies, Dead Sea Works and Negev Phosphates.
Profits were up at Dead Sea Periclase, which makes magnesia and hydrochloric
acid, Rotem-Amfert, which makes sulphuric and phosphoric acid, and at
Giulini Chemie, a West German subsidiary making phosphate salts and
aluminium sulphate.
Israel Chemicals intends to pay a dividend to the government of Dollars 12m,
after Dollars 50m in 1989.

<TEXT>
WITBANK Collieries, the coal arm of the Rand Mines group, suffered the
effects of rising costs and higher finance charges to record lower earnings
in the six months ended March 1991.
Turnover rose by 18 per cent to R569.4m (Dollars 210m) but tighter margins
saw operating profit only 4 per cent higher at R106.5m.
A sharp drop in investment income and a 27 per cent rise in the interest
charges to R26.3m, the result of the Middelburg mine purchase, left
after-tax profits 13 per cent lower at R51.3m.
The half-year dividend is being maintained at 210 cents a share but the
directors expect profits for the full year to show a decline.
In 1989-90, Witbank, one of South Africa's four big producers, contributed
R163.2m, or 73 per cent of Rand Mines' total attributable profits.
Export tonnages increased by 26 per cent, mainly as a result of the
first-time inclusion of Middelburg. The effects of an economic slowdown were
seen in the domestic market where sales declined by 4 per cent. Sales to
Escom, the power utility, increased by 13 per cent.
The directors reported that the increased turnover was mainly volume
related, with margins falling because of increased rail charges while
inflation-induced cost increases were not offset by export revenues which
were held in check by the firmness of the rand.

<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate with interests ranging from defence to insurance,
reported a 9.4 per cent fall in first-quarter profits, to Dollars 229m after
tax.
Earnings per share also fell, from Dollars 1.77 to Dollars 1.7, but, in both
cases, comparisons were distorted by one-off items.
On the one hand, the first quarter of 1991 took in portfolio gains of
Dollars 35m - or 26 cents a share - mainly at ITT Hartford, the insurance
arm. This contrasted with portfolio gains of Dollars 4m, or 3 cents a share,
in the corresponding period a year earlier.
On the other hand, the first quarter of 1990 was boosted by an after-tax
gain of Dollars 47m from the sale of the stake in Alcatel Alsthom. ITT said
that without this item, net income in the first quarter would have improved
by 18 per cent.
ITT said that its electronic components business improved on higher volumes
and better efficiencies at ITT semiconductors. ITT Defence also had a better
quarter due to more favourable margins on certain contracts and despite
lower sales.
The fluid technology business was 'slightly down' but ITT automotive and the
group's forest products division both saw sharper falls.

dollar

   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS Trust, the highly- regarded US banking group, suffered a 19 per cent
fall in first-quarter earnings. A strong advance in trading income was more
than offset by higher non-interest expenses, lower foreign exchange revenues
and write-offs on investments in highly-leveraged companies.
Net earnings slipped to Dollars 160m, or Dollars 1.85 a share, from Dollars
198m, or Dollars 2.36, a year earlier. Interest income fell only slightly to
Dollars 213m.
The company blamed an 8.4 per cent rise in non-interest expenses partly on
the weaker dollar, which accounted for about a quarter of the increase.
Staff severance costs jumped by Dollars 40m.
Trading revenues almost doubled to Dollars 304m, thanks largely to a strong
performance by the capital markets business, which includes interest rate,
currency and equity derivative products. But corporate finance fees tumbled
by 23 per cent.
Loans on the bank's books continue to fall sharply, reflecting the policy of
the past four years of distributing a higher proportion of loans to other
financial institutions, such as regional and foreign banks, insurance
companies and pension funds. Its total loan portfolio stood at Dollars
19.6bn on March 31, down from Dollars 29.2bn in 1986.

<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to rehabilitate Executive Life of California, the main operating
unit of troubled Los Angeles-based insurer First Executive, have run into a
serious obstacle from the Internal Revenue Service, which claims to be owed
Dollars 643m.
Mr John Garamendi, the Californian insurance commissioner who seized control
of Executive Life earlier this month, warned that the move 'could force the
company into liquidation and jeopardise the savings of hundreds of thousands
of policyholders and annuitants'.
The Los Angeles office of the IRS, however, said that while it was obviously
concerned about policyholders' welfare, it had a duty to the US public to
make sure demands for back tax were logged.
The IRS claim covers tax which the authorities say the company should have
paid in 1981, 1982 and 1983, together with penalties and interest due
because of the non-payment. The IRS declined to split the tax sum from the
penalty/interest charges, although there were reports that the actual tax
claim totalled less than Dollars 250m.
The IRS acknowledged that the penalties/interest element was likely to be
substan-tial.
The Californian regulators have recently suggested that rehabilitation
efforts were centring on talks with a European consortium, led by Altus,
part of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank.
Officials at the Insurance Department said they did not know what the
reaction of the consortium had been to the tax demand.
However, Mr Garamendi said he would 'do everything in my power to stop this
IRS raid on the assets needed to pay Executive Life policyholders. I plan to
immediately contact both the Bush administration and Congressional leaders,'
he added.

<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, the tobacco and food group which was subject to the biggest
leveraged buyout in the US two years ago, yesterday reported a small
after-tax profit of Dollars 5m in the first quarter of 1991.
It is the first time RJR has made a profit after interest and tax since the
massive Dollars 25bn takeover masterminded by Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the
investment banking business. In the first quarter of 1990, RJR reported a
net loss of Dollars 222m.
News of the surplus seemed to surprise some Wall Street analysts, who
greeted the figures warmly. 'It's positive - we were expecting a small
loss,' commented one high-yield analyst at Salomon Brothers.
On the stock market, RJR shares rose in morning trading in New York by 3/8
to Dollars 11 7/8 , while its junk bonds also advanced on the profit news.
The company has just completed the latest in a series of refinancing
exercises aimed at reducing the cost of its outstanding debt.
The most recent restructuring involved the issue of 115m new shares, to
raise Dollars 1.29bn, plus a Dollars 1.5bn tranche of new junk bonds.
During the first quarter, RJR's operating profits rose to Dollars 647m, 7
per cent higher than the same period a year earlier, with 'cash earnings' -
that is, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation - marginally
improved at Dollars 940m against Dollars 923m.
Sales overall were 8 per cent higher at Dollars 3.47bn.
Of the two main business divisions, food showed the more marked advance.
Sales rose from Dollars 1.34bn to Dollars 1.51bn, while operating profits
(ahead of amortisation charges) were 21 per cent higher at Dollars 171m.
On the tobacco side, sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 1.96bn, while profits
edged 2 per cent higher at Dollars 648m. The company reported 'significant
volume gains' overseas, but said its domestic volumes were still falling by
more than the market generally - the latter figure standing at around 3 per
cent a year.
The flow of debt refinancings has helped to push down interest costs. In the
first quarter, cash interest expense was Dollars 307m from Dollars 388m.

CINCINNATI Milacron, one of the world's biggest machine tool makers, slipped
into the red in the first quarter on the back of weak demand and heavy price
discounting.
However, the company reported a pick-up in new orders, with a first-quarter
inflow 6 per cent higher than a year earlier and 14 per cent up on the
previous three months. The order backlog also widened during the quarter.
Milacron suffered a Dollars 5.9m loss, or 22 cents a share, in the first
quarter, against earnings of Dollars 2.5m, or 10 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales dipped to Dollars 181.1m from Dollars 184.2m.
Mr Daniel Meyer, chief executive officer, said slack business conditions
were especially evident in standard machine tool, grinding machine and
plastics machinery sectors.
He said stringent cost controls combined with new products and an expanded
distribution network should return the company to break-even in the second
quarter.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Bethlehem posts loss of Dollars
39.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WEAK demand and mounting costs have lead Bethlehem Steel, the second largest
US steel manufacturer, to unveil a Dollars 39.2m loss after tax in the first
three months of 1991. In the same period a year ago, the company made a
profit of Dollars 21.3m.
Bethlehem warned it expected to report a further deficit in the second
quarter of the year, despite 'a slight seasonal upturn'.
'While there are some signs of stability and potential recovery for the
economy . . . the outlook remains uncertain because of high unemployment,
credit constraints and the recent strengthening of the dollar,' the company
said.
But the Pennsylvania-based company said it was still studying the
possibility of a collaborative venture with British Steel. The venture,
announced in outline earlier this year, would involve the UK company in
taking over and reorganising the US group's subsidiaries which make
structural and rail steels.
Yesterday, Bethlehem said that, as part of a feasibility study, talks were
being held with the United Steel Workers Association 'concerning the joint
venture's requirements for competitive labour costs'.
Bethlehem had warned it would probably post a first-quarter loss, although
it did not specify the extent of the expected deficit.
Bethlehem said the basic steel division turned in an operating loss of
Dollars 26m, against a profit of Dollars 29m a year ago.
Steel-related operations made an operating loss of Dollars 7m, against a
Dollars 4m deficit in the first quarter of 1990. As a result, the overall
loss at the operating level reached Dollars 33.3m, compared with Dollars 25m
profit last year.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Securities houses reinforce
revival

<TEXT>
SALOMON and Morgan Stanley, two of the largest securities houses in the US,
provided fresh evidence of the revival in Wall Street's fortunes yesterday
when they unveiled big increases in first-quarter profits.
Salomon reported record net income of Dollars 273m, or Dollars 2.30 a share,
more than double the Dollars 119m earned a year earlier on revenues of
Dollars 690m. Total net revenues were Dollars 1.18bn, against Dollars 690m
in 1990.
Morgan Stanley posted a 46 per cent rise in net income to Dollars 120.1m, or
Dollars 3.07 a share, based on net revenues of Dollars 747.8m, up from
Dollars 578.2m in 1990.
A string of Wall Street firms has reported dramatically-improved profits for
the quarter, a result of the boom in New York share prices, the big rise in
trading activity, and the recovery in the underwriting of new stock and bond
issues.
For Salomon and Morgan Stanley, the main factor behind the improvement was
the large rise in revenues from principal trading activities, especially
stocks and bonds.
At Salomon, income from principal transactions rose nearly 50 per cent to
Dollars 968m on the back of strong earnings from proprietary trading and
market-making in equities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and
government issues. Overseas earnings were also healthy, especially on
European fixed-income securities and Asian equities.
Investment banking revenues rose by Dollars 15m to Dollars 99m at Salomon,
primarily due to a doubling in business from new issues of corporate stocks
and bonds, high-yield debt and mortgage-backed securities.
The two areas where Salomon performed less impressively were real estate and
Phibro Energy, the company's oil trading subsidiary, which posted pre-tax
earnings of Dollars 5m, against Dollars 7m a year earlier.
The cost of moving to a new headquarters in Manhattan, and an increase in
benefits and bonuses paid out alongside higher profits, pushed Salomon's
non-interest expenses up to Dollars 696m, against Dollars 489m a year
earlier.
The earnings picture was similar at Morgan Stanley, where a strong
performance from global sales and trading activities, particularly in fixed
income, equities, foreign exchange and commodities, lifted revenues from
principal transactions to Dollars 392.6m, up from Dollars 277.7m in 1990.
Income from investment banking business rose 14.5 per cent, with increased
debt and equity underwriting volume offsetting a decline in financial
advisory activity.
A 33 per cent rise in compensation and benefits expenses to Dollars 373.9m
accounted for the bulk of the increase in total outgoings at Morgan Stanley,
which totalled Dollars 544.2m in the quarter, up from Dollars 436.6m at the
same stage a year ago.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Generale de Banque lifts
dividend after advance

<TEXT>
GENERALE de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, yesterday announced net profits
for 1990 of BFr8bn (Dollars 232m) a rise of 7.8 per cent above those of
1988, the last comparable year.
Generale de Banque, whose 1989 results were depressed by heavy provisions
against foreign loan losses, said despite continued problems due to the
economic downturn in the US, deposits in Belgian francs grew by 8 per cent
following Belgium's decision to tie its franc more closely to the D-Mark.
Declaring a BFr5 increase in its dividend to BFr270 a share, Mr Jacques
Groothaert, the bank's chairman, said that while the bank had made certain
exceptional profits last year, from the sale of its stake in European
American Bancorp and in Lease International, it also had to pay out BFr2bn
last year towards redundancies, aimed at shedding some 1,500 staff by the
end of this year.
Mr Groothaert said Generale de Banque, which recently abandoned an ambitious
cross-border merger plan with Amro Bank of the Netherlands, had no
intentions of linking up with any Belgian bank at home.
Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, one of the largest Belgian holding companies,
yesterday announced consolidated profits for 1990 of BFr5.68bn, up from
BFr4.25bn the year before.
The results included capital gains from the sale of GBL's stake in
Wagons-Lits, the Belgian tourism and hotel company, which was offset by an
exceptional BFr3bn book loss from the deconsolidation of the US assets of
the group. Much of this, BFr2.5bn, was 'purely a book-keeping loss' due to
the accumulated depreciation of dollar assets since 1982.
GBL raised its dividend for 1990 to BFr274-a-share, up from BFr215 the year
before.
Barco, the Flemish electronics group, has maintained its dividend of BFr26 a
share, even though pre-profit tax for 1990 fell to BFr899m, from BFr1.22bn
in 1989.
The poorer profits reflected mainly the cost of acquisitions in the US and
Europe.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: NEC says it is in talks over
taking stake in Bull
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday agreed it was taking part
in negotiations with Groupe Bull of France which could lead to NEC holding a
stake in the state-owned computer manufacturer and a seat on the main board.
NEC's acceptance of its involvement in talks implies it approves a profound
restructuring plan prepared by Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull chief executive,
designed to eliminate Bull's huge losses and return the company to
profitability within three years.
The plan involves sweeping away the company's untidy and inefficient
structure and replacing it with a global operation comprising separate
operational divisions handling manufacture and marketing for different
regions.
The Japanese company refused to comment on speculation that the stake could
be as much as 10 per cent.
The Japanese manufacturer supplies the loss-making French computer maker
with large mainframe computers and has extensive links with it.
Groupe Bull is NEC's principal marketing conduit to the West for its large
machines.
Talks have been going on for some months with a view to resolving the future
of NEC's 15 per cent stake in Bull HN, a company set up in 1987 in which
Groupe Bull held a 72.2 stake, NEC, 15 per cent and Honeywell of the US 12.8
per cent.
Honeywell recently marked its final retreat from the computer business by
selling its stake in Bull HN to Groupe Bull for an undisclosed sum.
The success of Mr Lorentz' strategy depends on NEC's agreement to
redeploying its stake in Bull HN into Groupe Bull.
Senior government officials said Groupe Bull's losses - last year they
amounted to some Pounds 700m (Dollars 1.2bn) - and its need for a foreign
partner were big factors behind the Paris administration's decision early
this month to allow private companies to take minority stakes in state-owned
ones.
The government would be relieved, sources suggest, to see Bull supported by
such a strong partner as NEC.
Observers had long speculated that Bull's problems would be the final
element to force the government to loosen President Francois Mitterrand's
three-year-old freeze on nationalisations and privatisations.
This relaxation in the government's hold on state industry comes in the form
of a decree, which paves the way for NEC to take a shareholding in Groupe
Bull, as well as easing the way for foreign alliances currently being
negotiated by two state banks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKF, the world's leading roller bearings manufacturer, recorded a 91.8 per
cent slide in its first-quarter profits after financial items due to falling
demand for its products. The drop was to SKr59m (Dollars 9.4m) from SKr721m
for the January-March period of 1990.
The company's net sales fell by 2.7 per cent to SKr6.92bn from SKr7.11bn.
Income per share was SKr0.90 after tax, compared with SKr3.7 last time. The
return on shareholders' capital for the most recent 12-month period was 2.9
per cent, compared with 7.3.
At the end of March this year, SKF's production level was 20 per cent below
what it was at the same time last year, with most plants operating well
below capacity.
SKF said its 60,000 workforce had been cut by 1,800 over the first three
months of the year. Inventories were virtually unchanged as at the end of
1990, at 35.2 per cent.
The company blamed the continuing fall in demand for its products in its
biggest European markets as well as in the US and Brazil.
SKF forecast continuing low demand over the next few months, with more costs
incurred by a further reduction in manpower. The company said a further
4,000 to 5,000 jobs may have to go this year if weak demand for its products
continued.
Profits after financial items for SKF's bearings divisions fell to SKr77m,
compared with SKr600m for the first quarter of 1990, although this year's
first-quarter result was better than the SKr110m loss sustained by bearings
in the fourth quarter of last year. Net sales were also down to SKr5.47bn,
from SKr6.04bn.
The company said bearings sales in the German car industry and in the Far
East had been maintained.
In its tools business, SKF suffered a SKr11m loss, compared with a SKr29m
profit for the same period of 1990 and a SKr29m loss in the fourth quarter
of last year.
Tool sales increased to SKr597m in the first quarter from SKr368m last time.

<TEXT>
LORAL, the US defence electronics group, yesterday completed the Dollars
182m sale of 49 per cent of its satellite business to three European
partners.
This concludes an agreement made in October with Alenia, the Italian
state-owned aerospace group, plus Aerospatiale and Alcatel Espace, the
French public and private sector aerospace companies.
Space Systems/Loral makes communications and weather satellites, with 2,000
employees and sales of Dollars 350m last year. The four partners' combined
forces represents one of the world's biggest civil communications and
weather satellites groupings, with 7,800 employees and Dollars 1.5bn of
joint turnover.
The US satellite business, formerly part of the space systems division of
the Ford Motor Company, was won by Loral in an auction last summer, against
unsuccessful bids from rival teams including Aerospatiale and Alcatel.
The completion comes days after the acquisition by Alenia and Aerospatiale
of Boeing's De Havilland subsidiary in Canada, and underlines the growing
ambitions of the two continental European aerospace manufacturers to break
into the US and the specialised satellite markets.
According to Alenia, the deal will help the three European companies provide
turn-key communications packages, offering clients satellites, control
units, earth stations and related services.
The three European companies have worked together with the US group now
owned by Loral for some time on commercial communications satellites,
notably the Intelsat V series and three Arabsat models. They are currently
involved in the joint development of the next generation of Intelsat VII
satellites due to enter operation next year.
Independently, Alenia, which was formed from the merger of the state-owned
Aeritalia and Selenia aerospace and defence groups late last year, has
sealed a number of international collaboration agreements in recent weeks as
part of its own foreign expansion drive.

MATRA, the French missiles and electronics group, yesterday reported that
profits stagnated last year on a gentle increase in orders and sales.
Net earnings were FFr606m (Dollars 101.89m), barely changed from the FFr605m
recorded in 1989, on turnover up 10 per cent at FFr24.3bn from FFr22.1bn.
The group received FFr26.3bn of orders last year, against FFr24bn in 1989.
Space and defence, the largest division, which makes missiles, defence
electronics and satellites, saw its turnover rise from FFr8.4bn to
FFr10.3bn.
This includes the first FFr4.5bn contribution from Matra Marconi Space, the
51 per cent owned space equipment company.
The transport and car division, which produces the recently re-launched
Espace for Renault and makes urban railways and automotive electronics,
reported sales of FFr8.1bn, representing 34 per cent of group turnover.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Spanish utilities propose
Dollars 5bn power merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO biggest private sector electricity utilities in Spain, Hidrola and
Iberduero, are in 'advanced and serious' negotiations to create a new
company that would make it one of Europe's largest private utilities with
combined generating capacity of some 14,000MW and a market capitalisation of
more than Dollars 5bn.
Representatives of the two companies met on Monday with the Ministry of
Industry and Energy to discuss the proposals, which could involve a full
merger or the creation of a joint holding company. The proposals have been
prompted by government plans to radically re-design and streamline the
electricity sector.
Madrid wants to take the country's 12 generators - most of which also
control their own distribution networks - and create just two or three
groups. Ideally, it would then hand over nationwide distribution to a single
company which would be able to buy electricity from, and sell it to, Spain's
neighbours in the European single market after 1992.
The big private utilities - Hidrola, Iberduero, Sevillana and Union Fenosa -
have become alarmed at the prospect of being pressed by the government into
arrangements and mergers that do not suit them. They have been desperately
trying to come up with their own plans to pre-empt the government's plans.
The commotion sweeping the sector - the second biggest on the Madrid Stock
Exchange after the banking industry - has been compounded recently by
aggressive corporate raiding by the state-controlled generator, Endesa, the
country's biggest generator, from which the private utilities are obliged to
buy what they claim is overpriced power.
Endesa's acquisitions include 10 per cent of Sevillana, the big Andalucian
utility in 1989, and, this year, 80 per cent of Electra de Viesgo in the
north, and smaller stakes in Fecsa, the Catalan utility, and Union Fenosa,
which also operates in northern Spain.
'This is little more than nationalisation,' said a senior Spanish banker
involved in the industry. Spanish banks own stakes in most utilities and
vote up to 40 per cent of utility shares using proxy votes at shareholder
meetings. Analysts believe Endesa may be accumulating the stakes to get into
distribution or to use in an eventual swap of assets which the government
might order to facilitate its reorganisation.
At the heart of the debate is a highly complex system of compensations
erected by the government in 1987 to keep tariffs standard nationwide. This
assists high-cost producers by forcing efficient generators to distribute a
share of their income around less fortunate operators.
Endesa, probably reflecting government plans, says it wants three groups
created, with Hidrola and Iberduero and itself leading them. This would
leave Endesa free to take control of Sevillana, Fecsa and Union Fenosa.
A combined Hidrola and Iberduero, which would bring together Iberduero's
strong hydro-electrical assets and more modern conventional generating plant
at Hidrola, would pose a strong industrial threat to Endesa's vision.
Combined generating capacity would be close to that of the newly-created
PowerGen in the UK. Total shareholder equity in Hidrola and Iberduero would
be more than Pta1,000bn (Dollars 9.2bn), compared with the Endesa group's
current Pta472bn. Combined long-term debt, though, would total Pta1,300bn,
against Endesa's current Pta450bn.
The Energy Ministry, which is designing a new national energy tariff plan to
coincide with the reorganisation of the sector in the next few months, could
block a merger simply by threatening it with unprofitable compensation
arrangements even though it seems unlikely to drop its unified tariff.
Madrid, however, is loathe to be seen to be over manipulative of private
sector companies and may give it the green light if, in return, shareholders
in Sevillana, Fecsa and Union Fenosa can be persuaded to ease Endesa's entry
as the other main controlling force in the sector.

sales
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERIDANIA, the agro-industrial subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi group, suffered
a fall in consolidated net profits to L230bn (Dollars 176m) last year from
L298bn in 1989, writes Haig Simonian.
The decrease, which partly stemmed from a drop in net extraordinary items to
L61bn from L150bn in 1989, came despite a 2.9 per cent increase in sales to
L9,165 from L8,909.
Net profits at parent company level fell to L60bn from L68bn in 1989.
Eridania, which earlier this month announced a rights issue of up to L281bn,
is paying an unchanged dividend of L240 for ordinary shares and L270 for
savings shares.
The group, which last year raised its share of national sugar production in
Italy to almost 37 per cent, said dry weather conditions in Europe had
combined with the Gulf crisis and the rise in the value of the dollar to
make business conditions more difficult last year. However, net operating
profits rose by 8.8 per cent to L594bn.
The company said it expected improved results for the current year, both in
terms of operating earnings and sales.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Doctus shares fall 8p on profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCTUS, the management, personnel and marketing consultancy, yesterday
issued a profit warning and said it was reviewing the marketing element of
its business - which was beefed up under two years ago through the Pounds
40m merger with Prospective Group.
Doctus's share price fell 8p to 39p, compared with its 12-month high of 138p
last May.
The group also announced that the roles of chairman and chief executive were
to be split. Mr Brian Blake would continue as chairman and Mr Alan
Greenough, who joined the board last October, would take the latter post. A
non-executive deputy chairman was also about to be appointed.
Mr Blake, who said the management changes were not connected with the weaker
performance, said the group's interim pre-tax profit to March 31 would be
'quite a bit below' last year's Pounds 4.1m.
The Gulf war and downturn in the UK economy had led to 'a decision
paralysis' and the cancellation of some orders. Trading had suffered
particularly in January and February.
For the full year brokers' forecasts of Pounds 10m-Pounds 12m (Pounds 11.4m)
would not be met, although trade had picked up since the first half. The
group was about to announce disposals that would reduce year-end debt of
Pounds 25m.
Its review of strategy included considering whether or not to keep the
marketing activities, which accounted for 60 per cent of operating profit
last year. Prospective, formerly known as Pineapple because of its roots in
the eponymous dance studio, was mostly marketing orientated.
Mr Blake said the decision to review this side of the business did not mean
that Prospective - acquired for shares, but bringing in substantial debt -
had been a bad buy. If parts were put up for sale, they would only go if the
prices were right.
Marketing's performance had been flat last year compared with more than
doubled profit growth at the management and human resources consultancies.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: McKechnie slides to Pounds 10.5m as
Australian recession hits sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXABLE PROFITS continued to slide at McKechnie, the West Midlands-based
plastic components, specialist engineering and household products group.
For the half year to January 31 1991 profit came to Pounds 10.5m, down from
Pounds 12.7m, which itself was down some 27 per cent on the 1988-89 first
half. Earnings per share for the latest period were 8.8p (10.5p).
The interim dividend, however, is maintained at 5p. That reflected a degree
of optimism about the prospects for the second half.
Indeed, Mr Jim Butler, chairman, said not only that UK companies, even those
in the sluggish automotive sector, were reporting 'steadier trading
conditions' but also 'it is tempting to believe that the worst of the
recession is over.' At the same time group companies in the US had growing
order books. However, that was offset by continuing problems in
Austral-asia.
Recession in Australia led to lower demand and put pressure on margins
during the first half. Exchange rate movements took Pounds 500,000 out of
operating profits; those factors were the most significant in the decline of
group profits. UK and US operations, helped by cost cutting and product
improvement, managed to hold their earnings levels of 1989-90.
Return on assets and on sales fell largely because of the acquisition of
Engineered Custom Plastics in the US. That company had not been operating
profitably but should be by the end of the year.
Turnover dropped to Pounds 153.6m (Pounds 178.6m), partly because of the
Australian experience. Just as important, however, was the re-positioning of
the group, its greater concentration on plastics and specialist engineering,
brought about by the sale of its UK metals operations, which had provided a
quarter of operating profits. The impact of the sales will be spread over
the whole year.
During the second half turnover and profits again would be affected but
interest charges would be lower. The sale of the metals companies -
McKechnie Extruded Products, Worcester Parsons and Stelco - would realise
Pounds 53m cash which was initially being used to strengthen the balance
sheet. Gearing would be reduced to less than 10 per cent by the end of the
financial year.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Interest boost helps Farnell to Pounds
33.8m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in interest income helped Farnell Electronics, the
manufacturer and distributor of electrical and electronic equipment,
increase pre-tax profits by 10 per cent from Pounds 30.64m to Pounds 33.78m
in the year to February 3.
Farnell, which had cash balances of Pounds 29m at the year-end, benefited
from high rates available in the money markets and interest income rose from
Pounds 1.45m to Pounds 3.8m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 169.7m to Pounds 163.8m, mainly because of the
disposal of AC Farnell, a wholesale distributor of brown goods, sold in
March last year.
Farnell's main division, electronic component distribution, increased
operating profits from Pounds 21.33m to Pounds 23.43m on turnover up from
Pounds 97.36m to Pounds 104m.
Electronic equipment manufacturing saw operating profits fall from Pounds
8.87m to Pounds 7.12m on turnover of Pounds 60.3m, down from Pounds 65.46m.
Earnings per share increased by 12 per cent to 16.3p (14.5p).
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 3p, bringing the total
for the year to 5.5p, a rise of 15 per cent.
Mr Henry Elstone, finance director, said the group's German subsidiary made
a loss of Pounds 2m, but its development was continuing and he was looking
for a good return in the current year.
Mr Elstone said the group had been hit by recessionary conditions in the UK,
but was confident that it would be able to maintain its 25-year record of
growth in earnings per share.
Farnell's Australian subsidiary made a small net profit during the year,
which Mr Elstone said was a commendable performance in view of the
difficulties of the economic climate there.
COMMENT
These are good results in view of the depth of the recession in the UK
economy, which still accounts for the vast majority of the Leeds-based
group's business. Farnell did well to increase profit margins slightly in
its already extremely lucrative distribution business, but holding the
erosion in manufacturing margins to 11.8 per cent, compared with 13.6 per
cent in the previous year, is just as impressive.
The main concern in the market is that Farnell will use its cash pile to pay
too much for the distribution activities of STC, the British
telecommunications group bought last year by Northern Telecom of Canada.
However, paying over the odds would not be in character for a canny northern
management team.
Forecast flat profits of Pounds 33.5m put the shares, up 4p yesterday to
206p, on a prospective multiple of just over 12, in line with its sector.
That seems undemanding, particularly if the German investment comes good,
but the shares are unlikely to advance until the group's acquisition
intentions become clearer.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Flat showing as FR dips to Pounds 21.3m -
Worldwide defence cuts and project delays take their toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FR GROUP, the aviation products group which makes 65 per cent of its sales
in the defence sector, reported flat profits and earnings for 1990.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 22.6m), on turnover of Pounds
169.2m (Pounds 153.8m). Earnings per share came to 20.07p (20.75p). The
final dividend is unchanged at 4.14p maintaining the total at 6.37p for the
year.
The results came against a worldwide background of cuts in defence
procurement. They were also specifically affected by losses at WES, the
con-tainers and general engineering division. Without these, profits would
have been slightly ahead, said Mr Giles Irwin, finance director.
He said FR had now 'taken the knife' to WES, which had been integrated into
Flight Refuelling, the dominant air-to-air refuelling pod division.
Mr Irwin said this division put in a good performance as did the other
larger operations - notably FR Aviation, which provides training and
maintenance to the military.
However, group performance had been, and continued to be, affected by delays
in sizeable projects. Supplies of refuelling pods to the US airforce, for
instance, had been delayed owing to a change in specification. There had
been cost overruns on the Phoenix air vehicle project where GEC is the main
contractor.
Mr Irwin said the Gulf conflict had produced a 'number of small value items'
for FR but nothing significant in a group context.
COMMENT
The long-running sore of delayed contracts continues to trouble FR along
with other companies in its sector. The current year is promising no relief
from the complaint, especially ahead of the white paper in June, which is
expected to clear up deep uncertainty about how big the British armed forces
are going to be in the future. That means FR is set to complete its third
year of broadly flat profits, perhaps making no more than Pounds 20m
pre-tax. This puts the shares on a prospective p/e of about 8.5 while the
yield is some 5 per cent. The shares are well down on levels achieved at the
start of last year but still look fully-valued for the moment at 160p. It is
reasonable to expect a recovery in 1992; but there is no near-term relief
for long-suffering investors who have now been waiting for four years for FR
to recover the momentum of its earlier career.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone losses rise to Pounds 6.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCCARTHY &amp; STONE, the UK's biggest builder of retirement homes, announced
deepened losses of Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 5.7m) on turnover down from Pounds
38.3m to Pounds 33.1m for the six months to end-February.
Basic losses per share were 14.4p (9.6p). The interim dividend, however, is
maintained at 0.5p.
Mr John McCarthy, chairman, said he remained cautious about the level of
sales for the rest of the year.
Volumes were virtually unchanged during the first half with 404 units sold
compared with 408.
Reductions in working capital meant group borrowings, excluding a
convertible loan stock of which Pounds 14.8m is outstanding, fell from
Pounds 90.4m to Pounds 87.4m, cutting gearing to 96 per cent. Inclusive of
the convertible, gearing was 112 per cent.
The half-year period was affected by a drop in the contribution from land
sales and other operating income, including sale of fixed assets and
commissions earned by Peverel, the management company.
The company said land sales resulted in a profit of Pounds 200,000, down
from Pounds 500,000, while other operating income accounted for Pounds 1.1m,
against Pounds 2.6m.
In anticipation of an upturn next year, the company has recommenced
construction on a number of sites.
Stocks at February 28 comprised a land bank of 2,189 units plus 253 units at
various stages of construction and 1,413 available for sale.
Interest took Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 9.1m). The tax credit arising on losses is
not yet being accounted for.
COMMENT
There was some encouraging news in these results in that, after a very sharp
fall last year, volumes appear now to be trundling along the bottom. That
still leaves all those long-term investors who bought into McCarthy &amp; Stone
a few years ago, when sheltered housing was all the rage, almost as woeful
as the elderly would-be customers of the company who found they could not
sell their existing homes.
Still, the company is a reasonable play on the expected recovery in its
market niche. However, it should be remembered that as a longer-term
strategy McCarthy has turned its back on nursing homes - thought by many to
be coming thing as the elderly survive for ever more years - having
complained it could not make decent returns.
After losing Pounds 10.8m last year, it should produce a deficit of about
Pounds 8m this time before the pre-tax line moves back into the black in
1992. The shares presented a buying opportunity at a low of 33p last
December, but that evaporated with a subsequent sharp recovery. Yesterday
they stood at just above 90p.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Coats extends offer after only 0.69%
acceptance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COATS VIYELLA, the textile group which is in the throes of a Pounds 194m
hostile bid for Tootal, announced yesterday that it was extending its offer
after receiving acceptances representing 0.69 per cent of its target's
ordinary shares.
Coats, which already owns 85.65m ordinary shares, or 29.41 per cent of
Tootal's equity, has received acceptances for a further 2.02m shares. It
also has acceptances for 3.67m (62.35 per cent) of the preference shares.
This means the level of acceptances received by Coats from Tootal
shareholders has fallen slightly since the previous closing date. Tootal
yesterday issued a statement claiming this meant its arguments were 'winning
the day'.
The Pounds 194m bid has effectively been put on ice until May 10 while the
Office of Fair Trading considers whether to refer it to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. Tootal may then issue additional information, such as a
profits forecast, and Coats could mount a second offer.
Tootal's shares were unchanged at 76p yesterday, still higher than Coats'
offer of 65p cash. Coats' shares slipped 2p to 137p.

<TEXT>
Ptarmigan Holdings, a maker of sausage casings and cake decoration products,
reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6,000 for the half year to December 31
1990, against a Pounds 263,000 profit last time.
Operating profits dropped from Pounds 305,000 to Pounds 167,000, but these
were wiped out by increased interest charges of Pounds 173,000 (Pounds
42,000). There was no tax (Pounds 84,000 charge) and losses per share came
out at 0.06p (1.83p earnings).
Extraordinary charges, related to the closure costs of the hatchery
operation, totalled Pounds 306,000 (Pounds 77,000).

second half of the year resulting in an overall 39 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits.
On turnover of Pounds 42.34m (Pounds 35.67m) profits for the 12 months to

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the half year ended March 3 1991, 'a most difficult period', Cosalt
returned pre-tax profits down Pounds 617,000 at Pounds 1.01m.
Outlining the reasons, Mr Edward Brian, chairman, said the fishing industry
remained depressed, the caravan companies had to reduce working hours to
allow overproduction to be absorbed by the market, and the workwear side,
which manufactures for the rental trade, received fewer orders as a
consequence of the recession.
The interim dividend is held at 4.25p, payable from earnings per share of
5.9p (9.36p).

<TEXT>
Higher interest charges made inroads into interim profits at VTR, the
USM-quoted video editing and audio-visual house, resulting in a pre-tax
figure of Pounds 432,000, against Pounds 601,000.
Mr Philip Lovegrove, chairman, explained that the rise in charges from
Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 124,000 was a direct consequence of the capital
investment programme.
No further large capital expenditure was planned for the rest of the year.
Mr Lovegrove said both Video Tape Recording and AV Department increased
their revenue, despite difficult trading conditions.
Turnover rose to Pounds 3.18m (Pounds 2.71m). Earnings per share came to
3.7p (5p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.2p (1.1p).

Conrad Continental, which runs leather clothing, fashion accessories and the

Turnover fell to Pounds 12.06m (Pounds 13.12m) and the operating profit was
only Pounds 9,000 (Pounds 302,000). The situation was exacerbated by higher
interest charges of Pounds 481,000 (Pounds 278,000), but offset to some
extent by a reduction in exceptional charges to Pounds 208,000 (Pounds
307,000).
Losses per share were 3.51p (1.2p). There is no dividend (interim 1p).

The Isle of Man Fraud Squad announced yesterday that it had completed its

The questions were posed to the island's Financial Supervision Commission by

An exceptional provision of Pounds 8m, made to reflect the depressed state
of the housing market, left Allied London Properties, the housebuilder and

The commercial property investment portfolio produced a 'creditable
performance' according to Sir Geoffrey Leigh, chairman, with rental income
19 per cent ahead to Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 6.1m) mainly due to rent reviews
settled at 'satisfactory levels'.
Losses per share amounted to 9.43p (earnings 2.5p) but the interim dividend

The greatest contribution came from the pipeline distribution division,
where the full impact of the recession was not felt until December and an
operating profit of Pounds 6.95m (Pounds 6.48m) was achieved.
The water products division experienced particular problems owing to
customers inability to raise funds, but nonetheless turned in an increased
operating profit of Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 1.36m).
A final dividend of 5.975p is recommended, making 7.35p (7.025p) for the

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Scale back urged if Scottish electricity
sale oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is being urged not to offer shares in the two Scottish
electricity companies to overseas institutions so as not to disappoint
individual Scottish investors if the issue is heavily oversubscribed.
Torrie &amp; Co, the Edinburgh stockbroker which handles large numbers of
individual applications for privatisation shares, said it believed the issue
will be so popular that it risks embarrassing the Scottish Conservative
party and is calling on its customers to lobby MPs to block a foreign sale.
'It will be politically disastrous to sweet-talk the canny Scottish investor
into applying for sensible numbers of shares only to be offered nominal
allocations,' the broker said, especially if it is then perceived that
Japanese, American and European institutions have made 'guaranteed profits.'
About 20 per cent of recent privatisation issues, including the regional
electricity companies and the generators, have been sold to foreign
institutions.
The government has appointed advisers to prepare the way for offering shares
in Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric to institutions in Europe,
Japan, the US and Canada, but no decision has been taken on whether to sell
the shares overseas.
Torrie said interest among Scottish electricity customers was running high.
The issue is expected to raise between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2bn.

<TEXT>
the second largest in the UK - increased its final dividend by 10 per cent
to 4.95p despite a rise of only 0.8 per cent in net asset value per share in
the year to March 31.
The trust had net assets of Pounds 771.2m at its year end, equivalent to
262.5p per share, against 260.5p per share previously.
The increase in net assets lagged behind the FT-A All-Share Index - which
rose by 7 per cent over the same period - because of the overseas weighting
of the trust.
At March 31, 33 per cent of the portfolio was invested outside the UK, split
between continental Europe (11.5 per cent), Japan (8.8 per cent), United
States (8.3 per cent) and Far East (4.4 per cent).
Edinburgh has debenture debt of Pounds 105m, most of which is invested in
the markets.
The total dividend for the year is 7.7p (7p) based on earnings per share of
8.15p (7.84p).
Although net asset value underperformed against the index, a narrowing in
the discount to net asset value of the share price - from 19.4 per cent to
14.4 per cent - helped the shares to perform almost in line with the
All-Share Index over the year.

battle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BATTLE for control of Cowan de Groot is in the offing after Bridgend
Group, the distribution, leisure and property concern, announced it was
considering making a cash offer for the toys, electrical components, and
household goods company.
Bridgend had earlier purchased 1.15m shares in Cowan, lifting its holding to
9.98 per cent.
The move comes as a response to last week's agreed share-exchange offer from
Wilton Group, chaired by Mr Michael Buckley, who also heads Cowan.
Bridgend had earlier unveiled a 74 per cent expansion in taxable profits for
1990. The outcome - Pounds 1.06m against Pounds 608,000 - included a
nine-month contribution from the Woodington leisure and property group
purchased in March 1990. Interest charges took more at Pounds 819,000
(Pounds 549,000).
Turnover totalled Pounds 7.85m (Pounds 3.87m on continuing operations).
Earnings per share on the sharply increased capital emerged at 3.5p (3.1p).
A recommended final dividend of 0.8p brings the total for the year to 1.2p
(1p).

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Tarmac sinks 49% to Pounds 190.7m - Sharp
fall likely in current first half as property recession continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEEP recession in UK and US housing and commercial property markets
caused pre-tax profits at Tarmac to fall by 49 per cent, from Pounds 377m to
Pounds 190.7m, last year.
Sir Eric Pountain, chairman of Britain's biggest construction and building
materials group, warned that profits would also fall sharply in the first
half of this year.
Sir Eric said January and February had been particularly bad months for UK
housebuilding and construction material sales. These had been further
depressed for part of that time by severe winter weather.
He said it would be difficult, although not impossible, to reover the first
half downturn during the final six months of the year: 'Much will depend
upon the timing and the pace of recovery in the UK housing market. There has
been a slight improvement in sales since interest rates started to fall in
February.' said Sir Eric.
The share price fell by 16p to 229p following the warning.
Sir Eric said Tarmac's markets last year had been the toughest for more than
a decade, reflecting the severity of the economic downturn in the UK and US.
Group operating margins fell from 12.7 per cent to 7.2 per cent as sales
volume and prices came under severe pressure in most divisions.
Only the construction division achieved an increase in operating profits -
ahead 30 per cent to Pounds 40m helped by an increase in UK road contracts.
In contrast, housing profits collapsed 63 per cent from Pounds 183.5m to
Pounds 67.3m. The group blamed expensive land bought in 1987 and 1988 for a
sharp fall in margins. The number of houses sold slipped from just over
12,000 in 1989 to 11,209 last year. The average price of a Tarmac home had
remained static at about Pounds 75,000.
Sir Eric said this masked a price reduction in real terms as the group had
built fewer one bedroom homes.
Profits from UK quarries fell by 20 per cent to Pounds 80m. Tarmac said
volume sales of aggregates and ready-mix concrete had been maintained at the
expense of margins as prices had fallen. Black top sales, however, had
increased reflecting the rise in road construction.
Profits from sales of other building materials fell by 42 per cent to Pounds
17m. Sales of brick and aerated blocks were hit particularly hard by the
decline in UK housebuilding. Industrial product profits fell by 15 per cent
to Pounds 38m while commercial property profits declined by 40 per cent to
Pounds 12.7m.
There was no comfort in the US where profits halved from Pounds 43.7m to
Pounds 20.8m. Before currency translations profits were down by 43 per cent
to Dollars 40.1m. As in the UK, volume sales and prices were under pressure
in many of Tarmac's US markets.
Earnings per share fell from 32.3p to 16.7p leaving total dividends
unchanged at 11.25p, covered 1.5 times. The final distribution is held at
8.25p.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Budgens board examines cost of
restructuring proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUDGENS, the troubled chain of neighbourhood grocery stores, is asking
Charterhouse to act as its financial advisers in addition to Kleinwort
Benson after receiving restructuring proposals from a group of institutional
shareholders.
These proposals called for the removal of Mr John Fletcher as chairman and
the appointment of new directors.
Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the WPP marketing services group, will
now play a pivotal role in determining the Mr Fletcher's future.
As the only non-executive director on the Budgens board, Mr Sorrell will
have to consider the merits of the proposals put to the company by IEP
Securities, Electra Investment Trust, and Gartmore Investment Management
which between them account for 27 per cent of its equity.
The proposals also envisaged bolstering the board through the appointment of
three external executives: Mr John von Spreckelsen and Mr Christian
Williams, who previously worked at Bowater Freight Services, and Mr Graham
Rigby, an accountant.
Budgens is currently inquiring into the experience of the three executives
and considering what expertise they could bring to the company.
The board is also exploring its options concerning the future funding of the
company and how it can reduce its borrowings of Pounds 30m.
One factor that will weigh heavily with the Budgens board is the cost of
replacing Mr Fletcher.
He has only recently signed a five-year contract and his pay last year
amounted to Pounds 145,000. Coupled with pension payments it is conceivable
that Mr Fletcher could receive more in a compensation package for loss of
office than the shareholders will gain this year in dividends.
But the three executives who may join the board will not come cheap as they
are asking for a collective salary package of about Pounds 300,000 plus a
number of share options.
The prime mover behind the proposals is IEP Securities, the investment
vehicle founded by Sir Ron Brierley, which bought into Budgens at the time
of the company's merger discussions with William Low, the Scottish grocery
chain, in 1989.
IEP later bought further shares to average down the cost of its shareholding
but it is still sitting on a huge loss.
The average price it paid for its shares is estimated at 85p compared with
Budgens' closing share price of 46p yesterday.
The Budgens board will have to be careful not to be seen to favour one group
of investors - however powerful they may be - above the other 23,000
shareholders.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Brent Walker finalising its 1990 accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the heavily-borrowed leisure group, is this week finalising
its accounts for 1990, a period which saw the group's stop-gap refinancing
of its Pounds 1.4bn of debt.
The preliminary results are expected in the first half of May with the full
accounts published later in the month.
Brent Walker is still working with its bankers on a restructuring of its
liabilities on a long-term basis, better to match its assets and trading
prospects.
It is likely that the accounts will be qualified as have those of other
companies involved in financial restructurings. Generally, auditors have
said that the accounts are prepared on the assumption that the restructuring
is successful.
Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, the group's property valuer, is understood to have
completed a revaluation of the property assets, which will have taken
account of the fall in the property market since the last valuation at the
end of 1988.
Directors may argue with the group's audit committee over how much of the
revaluation they incorporate in the accounts. Bankers, however, will look at
the actual valuation when assessing the group's ability to carry debt, and
will also look at the sale value of whole businesses rather than the value
put on individual properties.
The group's bankers are also due to see a draft report on the company by
Touche Ross, the accountants. However, this report is expected to be revised
as the company has reworked its cashflow forecasts. It will eventually form
the basis of the restructuring.
The task facing Brent Walker and its banks is to raise cash and to prune the
business to produce a company capable of servicing its debt. To this end it
has been discussing the sale of various assets with interested buyers for
some months.
Allied-Lyons, the brewing, wines and spirits, and food group, confirmed
yesterday that it was in talks with Brent Walker over its brewing and pub
interests. It added that an internal memo which had been leaked to the press
'represented an analysis of commercial considerations to be addressed and
does not represent any form of definitive agreement'.
Allied said that it would be two or three weeks before the two sides could
establish whether there might be a deal.
Brewing analysts pointed out that following the government's proposals for a
shake up in the industry, the sector was in a state of flux. One said
'everyone is talking to everyone else about everything'.
One suggestion was that Allied could agree to supply Brent Walker's 1,122
pubs, putting extra volume through its own six breweries, which could be
very profitable. This might lead to the closure of Brent Walker's brewery.
Brent Walker's brewing and pub interests largely relate to its acquisition
of J W Cameron and Tollemache &amp; Cobbold for Pounds 324m in December 1988
from the Barclay brothers. This purchase included two breweries and 855
pubs.
The Tollemache brewery in Ipswich was closed in 1989 and production
centralised at Cameron's Lion Brewery in Hartlepool. Brent Walker already
buys in a sizeable proportion of its beer requirements.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Decline in financial printing hits St Ives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY FINANCIERS are not alone in mourning the dearth of contested takeover
bids. St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer, reported a 26 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 13.59m to Pounds 10.06m in the six
months to January 31, almost entirely due to the fall in financial printing.
Mr Robert Gavron, chairman, said the company had experienced the worst
trading conditions in 30 years. Turnover on financial printing had halved
and healthy profits in that division had turned into a small loss.
Group sales as a whole fell 8 per cent to Pounds 108.05m (Pounds 117.1m).
Earnings per share fell from 8.3p to 6.5p fully diluted but the interim
dividend is maintained at 1.5p.
The group had no net debt at the half way stage, but gearing was expected to
rise to 15 per cent by the year end as a result of completing a Pounds 127m
capital programme on new technology and consolidating printing at fewer
plants.
During the period, St Ives picked up the printing of 50 new titles. About 40
titles had been lost but as most of these had closed rather than gone to
competitors market share had increased.
Mr Gavron said that despite a pick up in financial printing as result of the
recent spate of rights issues, magazine advertising was still sluggish and
that division had further to fall before business improved.
COMMENT
Given the industry is printing 10-20 per cent fewer pages compared with six
months ago, a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits is neither surprising nor
a particularly poor showing. But things are likely to get worse before they
get better in the main consumer magazines, offset only partly by an upturn
in financial printing. While new printing technology and cost cutting will
put St Ives in good shape for the next up-cycle, looming opportunities in
Europe may not be wholly welcomed in the City. St Ives seems an obvious
partner for VNU, the Dutch publisher that says it wants to spin off its
printing arm, or Bertelsman of Germany if it goes the same way. The
possibility that such a partnership might require a call on shareholders for
cash is likely to overhang the share price. This year pre-tax profits of
Pounds 21.5m are expected, giving 14p per share. It looks fairly fully
priced with a multiple of nearly 17 times earnings.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: NatWest gloomy on first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD ALEXANDER, chairman of the National Westminster Bank, warned yesterday
that there would be no immediate improvement in the bank's performance
because of the recession and continued high level of bad debts.
However, the bank had taken several initiatives to cut costs which should
begin to flow through in the second half of the year. This would be followed
by significant improvements in 1992 and 1993.
Lord Alexander told the annual meeting that NatWest was taking several
initiatives to deal with problems which depressed last year's result,
particularly at its two loss-making arms, County NatWest, the investment
bank, and NatWest Bancorp, its US arm.
The equities business of County had met 'all significant milestones' which
were set for the first quarter of this year, and was well ahead of its plan
to achieve satisfactory profitability. In February, Lord Alexander gave the
business two years to get back in the black or risk closure.
NatWest also announced the appointment to the main board of Mr Derek
Wanless, chief executive of UK financial services.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: UK market conditions push Ward down 31%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WARD Group, the steel and building components combine, blamed the worst
UK market conditions in its 45 year history for a 31 per cent drop in
pre-tax profits.
For 1990 the profit came to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 12.6m). The final dividend
is 4.8p, for an unchanged 7.2p, payable from earnings of 25.2p (36.4p).
Mr Nigel Forsyth, chief executive, said the 'bitterly disappointing' results
would have been worse without the help of the European business, which
remained relatively buoyant. Non-UK turnover increased slightly to Pounds
67m (Pounds 63m) while overall sales were down to Pounds 172.8m (Pounds
175.3m).
The group was planning to expand further on the Continent, into eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union, increasing those sales from 39 per cent of
turnover to more than 45 per cent. It already has manufacturing plants in
Belgium, France, Italy and Germany.
However, Mr Forsyth warned that difficult market conditions would continue
throughout the year. He could not see any improvement in overall profits
until 1992.
The slump in profits led to the company reducing its employees from 2,360 to
1,852.
Gearing fell from 39 per cent to 26 per cent as borrowings were reduced from
Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 7.4m. Interest payable amounted to Pounds 2.04m,
covered five times by operating profit of Pounds 10.76m (Pounds 12.9m).
The group continued its investment programme, spending Pounds 7m on
developing new machinery and equipment. That brought the total invested over
the past four years to Pounds 30m, and a further Pounds 8m is allocated for
1991.

FT  24 APR 91 / Cannon St in Pounds 46m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANNON Street Investments, the debt-laden industrial holding company, is
raising Pounds 46.7m net via a one for three rights issue, and a placing and
offer of 25.7m convertible preference shares, in a move to slash its
borrowings by more than 40 per cent.
The rights issue of 25.69m new ordinary shares at 90p was at a discount to
the closing price on Monday of about 10 per cent gross. The shares closed up
18p at 124p yesterday.
The convertible preference shares, which are subject to clawback, have been
conditionally placed at Pounds 1 per share with the Bank of Scotland. The
fixed cumulative annual dividend on the convertibles is 9.75p (net) and the
conversion price is 120p.
Cannon Street's strategy is to buy smaller companies and develop them into
larger groups for eventual flotation on the market. Mr Bill Hislop,
chairman, said of the decision to launch a rights issue, placing and
offering: 'A major consideration was that we will be able to float our
businesses totally unhampered by gearing considerations.'
The group announced its cash call on the market as it reported a 35 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 26.5m to Pounds 17.3m for the year to
December 31. Turnover rose from Pounds 228.86m to Pounds 281.42m.
Interest charges for the year jumped from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 8.47m while
operating profits fell 6.8 per cent to Pounds 26.5m (Pounds 28.45m).
The group increased its bank borrowings to fund investments in its leisure
businesses. Since 1989, it has invested about Pounds 30m to expand its
hotels and leisure division. The contribution to operating profits from this
area rose from Pounds 2.6m to to Pounds 3.1m last year. Only the hotels and
leisure and electronics distribution divisions increased operating profits.
The business services division was stable but building and building
services, food and drink, and home improvements saw operating profits fall.
Cannon Street's results include a Pounds 700,000 loss representing its share
of the losses of Betacom, the telecommunications company, in which it has a
29 per cent stake. Further extraordinary losses of Pounds 3.3m were related
to bad debts and closure and rationalisation costs.
Total borrowings were Pounds 106.5m at the year-end against net assets of
Pounds 26.4m.
Earnings per share fell to 17.21p (24.15p) and an unchanged final dividend
of 5.5p was recommended, maintaining the total at 8.80p.

FT  24 APR 91 / Construction group calls for Pounds 162m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR Woodrow yesterday launched a one-for-four rights issue to raise
Pounds 162.4m, joining the growing number of British construction companies
seeking to take advantage of a weak property market
Shareholders will be offered one new share at 200p for every four already
owned.
Since the beginning of January, British companies have sought to raise
almost Pounds 3bn from rights issues. Just over Pounds 1bn of those issues
came from construction and property groups. Overall, British companies
sought only Pounds 4bn from rights issues in the whole of last year.
Mr Peter Drew, Taylor Woodrow's chairman, said the group would use the
proceeds of the rights issue to make 'selective acquisitions' in a weak
residential and commercial property market.
'Most property and housing developers have been less able than Taylor
Woodrow to withstand the burden of the current recession and, as a result,
opportunities have arisen to acquire property and housing assets at
favourable prices.
'A number of attractive opportunities have been identified and are receiving
active consideration,' said Mr Drew. The group would consider buying
companies as well as individual properties and development land.
He said the board considered that a rights issue was the most appropriate
way to raise funds to pursue investment opportunities and still maintain a
strong financial base with gearing and interest cover at reasonable levels.
'It is certainly cheaper than raising debt at current rates of interest,'
said Mr Drew. Net debt represents 41 per cent of shareholders' funds,
according to the group.
Taylor Woodrow's share price - after an initial slide of 14p - recovered to
close only 2p lower at 251p last night. Hambros Bank said that
sub-underwriting for the issue, which had been fully underwritten by the
bank, had been completed satisfactorily.
The group's cash call is the fourth-largest rights issue to be announced by
a British company this year. The biggest was by Tesco, the stores group,
which at the end of January announced a two-for-11 issue to raise Pounds
572m. Last month Bass, the brewery group, announced a Pounds 557m rights
issue while Redland, the UK building materials company, sought to raise
Pounds 280m from its shareholders.
A common theme among issues from building companies has been the need to
raise cash to prepare for recovery and to take advantage of the weakness of
other groups. Most companies say, however, that opportunities to buy land
for housing - the sector most likely to lead the recovery - have been
limited.
Taylor Woodrow, like other large UK construction groups, has been hit by the
collapse in residential and commercial property markets. Last month the
company announced a drop in pre-tax profits of 28 per cent last year to
Pounds 83.4m - the first fall at the group for 30 years.
It also revealed that the value of its commercial property portfolio had
fallen from Pounds 801.9m to Pounds 646.1m during the 12 months to the end
of December.
The group is forecasting a total dividend of 9.5p for the current year,
unchanged on last year.

FT  24 APR 91 / Kohl backs Berlin as new seat of government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday pledged his support for Berlin as Germany's
future seat of government.
He said a move to Berlin, already the official capital, would need 10 to 15
years to complete and that Bonn should retain a number of important
ministries, including defence.
The chancellor's surprise decision will boost Berlin's chances of again
becoming the seat of government. Bonn, Before his announcement, Bonn was
thought to be favoured by a slim majority of members in the Bundestag, the
lower house of parliament, and by most of the west German Lander (states).
It was decided yesterday that the Bundestag will conduct a free vote on the
issue on June 20. The Bundesrat, the upper house, will vote the following
day.
Mr Kohl, trying to regain the political initiative after his party's defeat
in a state election on Sunday, said a government in Berlin would be in a
better position to help overcome the division between the two parts of
Germany.
The announcement may help to boost Mr Kohl's flagging popularity in east
Germany where many voters equate a pro-Berlin view with a vote of confidence
in the east.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the pro-Bonn,
Bavarian-based, Christian Social Union, said he regretted the announcement
and insisted that he had no money available to finance the move, costed at
anything between DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) and DM100bn.
Mr Waigel said he would have preferred a compromise, dividing functions
between the two cities.

FT  24 APR 91 / Letter: Wealth in home-ownership should be welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES HANSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I find the concern in your editorial ('Housing and inflation', April
16) over equity withdrawal both complex and perplexing. Given that your
fellow countrymen reside - according to EC statistics - in the poorhouse of
Europe, one would have assumed the relatively recent ability of British
house-owners to utilise prior to death what little wealth they have been
able to accumulate would be welcomed.
The more so since some of that equity withdrawal has been used to finance
management buy-outs and other productive investments. Nor should equity
withdrawal from housing cause inflation through increased demand for
consumer and other goods since there is an adequate supply of foreign
manufactured goods competing to meet that demand.
The resulting trade deficit problems will only be solved by producing more
of those goods in this country to meet home market requirements. Similarly,
the home-grown inflation of house prices will only be solved when there is
sufficient supply of housing for purchase and rent available to meet demand.
The wholesale suppression of the housebuilding industry over the past two
years by inflation fuelling high interest rates which you have often
supported will simply cause house price inflation yet again in the future.
Taxation neither in the form of relief nor additions will not solve your
problems nor will reducing the already low level of wealth of the British
people. Until you recognise that inadequate supply is the main cause of the
inflation problem you are attempting to address you will never solve the
problem.

FT  24 APR 91 / Letter: Banks should take losses on the chin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN MCINTYRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Now that the banks' reporting season has mainly produced another
disastrous set of results I am experiencing a rather nasty consequence.
At our annual facility renegotiations with our various banks and
institutions, new charges and increases in some rates are being proposed.
This is despite our continuing satisfactory expansion and controlled use of
funds which in the past have led to reductions at similar annual meetings.
The reason given is always that profitability must be recovered.
Superficially, of course, they are correct but in every case the losses have
been caused by bad debts or provisions for non-performing loans following
disastrous lending policies in earlier years. Their profits at the trading
level continue to be more than satisfactory.
Why should other more prudent customers make good the mistakes of the banks'
managers? Surely such losses should be borne by the owners of the banks -
the shareholders.
All that such excessive zeal to increase rates will do is increase inflation
and slow our economic recovery. Come on you clearing banks - take your
losses on the chin and rebuild your customer base by supporting the better
borrowers. If your customer accepts blindly your new charges and increased
rates, maybe you would be wise not to lend to him]

FT  24 APR 91 / Letter: The warnings of a coming slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professors WYNNE GODLEY and BOB ROWTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article ('The New Consensus', April 20) is incorrect when
it states that, in contrast with 1981, there 'have been no howls of
complaint' from the universities about unemployment.
We, together and separately, have been warning for at least the past 18
months that the British economy was heading for a slump.
In particular, we pointed out last July, in an IPPR pamphlet entitled
'Britain's Economic Problems in the 1990s', that it would be a strategic
error of colossal magnitude to join the ERM in anything like the existing
exchange rate.
If Britain did so, we predicted that unemployment would eventually rise to
well over 3m with severe long term consequences.
These warnings and forecasts have subsequently been repeated on a great many
occasions. For instance, in the New Statesman on January 18, we predicted a
much larger and longer fall in output than other forecasters; in a
post-Budget review we forecast that unemployment would rise to about 3.5m by
the end of 1992.
And contrary to what your leader suggests, these forecasts were accompanied
by carefully argued, and strongly expressed, statements which explicitly
disputed the proposition that 'macroeconomic policy cannot target real
activity'.
The Treasury has won no argument. Over the years it has made one wildly
wrong forecast after another and, as a consequence, has undertaken policies
which have already had extremely damaging short run and structural effects
on the British economy.
It is dangerous that the British establishment should only admit one way of
thinking to be worthy of consideration at any given time, however wrong it
has been in the past and however much the orthodoxy changes.
At the same time it engages in a conspiracy of silence with respect to the
expression of fundamental disagreement.
In our view, the scale of the present downturn has, even now, not been
properly appreciated. And we strongly dispute that there is nothing which
can be done to stem the debacle.

FT  24 APR 91 / Letter: Britain's legacy from neglecting education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof M. DESAI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was disappointing to find Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, April
18) endorse the vulgar view that qualifications are unnecessary. It has been
a long-standing English practice to denigrate formal training by pointing to
the odd genius who made it to the top without such training. But for every
Isambard Kingdom Brunel who got to the top a thousand 16-year-olds are left
without hope of qualifications either from school or at work each year. That
neglect of education is at the root of Britain's structural problems is not
merely the view of the Labour party.
Mr Brittan also takes the standard neo-classical position that all things,
goods or services, are equal with production and that manufacturing should
have no special status. However, if you think in terms of tradeables and
non-tradeables, manufactures are more tradeable than services, and while it
is conceivable that an import bill of any size can be financed by income on
invisible account or capital inflow it is not very likely. The problem is
that for Britain to finance its import bill without a devised manufacturing
sector will require either a drastically devalued pound, a very high nominal
interest rate or a large number of unemployed. Economic policy is about the
art of the reasonably probable and not merely the remotely possible.

A crooked red revolve topped by onion domes and flanked by the paraphernalia
of country life, including a barely visible stuffed ram, provides the
setting for this classic of the Russian stage in a rambustious new
translation by Ronald Eyre. The ram is among equals, for Gogol's satire is
about the stuffed sheep of local government; and here they are, in their
Anglicised incarnations, with goatees and cheek puffs, quivering moustaches
and great bristling beards to signify the rank, age and dignity of petty
officialdom.
The Englishness of Matthew Francis' production extends beyond the
characterisation of this grubby local squirarchy to the character of the
comedy in which they are involved. For all their hypocrisy and corruption,
they are drawn with an affection for the stereotypes they represent. Arthur
Cox's apoplectic judge and Patrick O'Connell's mayor are awful, but we feel
safe with them; while Michael Burrell's timid, balaclava-clad schools
superintendent would pass muster for a Shakespearean mechanical, and Frank
Moorey's bulbous charity commissioner is a dead ringer for Mr Bumble the
beadle, from Oliver.
They are comic enough in the early whirlwind of conniving and kowtowing but
the play tries to push them further than their constitutions permit them to
go. When their stupidity has been revealed, and the mayor steps forward to
implicate his audience, there is no frisson of recognition, no fidgeting in
seats, because there is none of the cruelty that the satire demands. Even
the incursion of the wronged populace, in a nightmarish apparition to the
opportunistic Khlestakov, fails to make the leap.
The result is to pull the sting from the tale, leaving an empty space where
the phony inspector has been, and making the announcement of the real
inspector's arrival - by a state servant in gleaming Czarist gold  - a mere
textual formality. Matthew Francis' production lives through the
performances of Timothy Spall and Bob Goody as Khlestakov and his servant
Osip, a beaky scrimbleshanks of misdirected loyalty.
Spall, particularly, is on cracking form as a little Lord Fauntleroy gone to
seed who stamps a chubby foot and crinkles a piggy snout as he fights to
rescue his dignity from a greasy strand of hair, the relic of some foppish
haircut, which is forever flopping forward over his face.
The spectacle of Khlestakov succumbing to his host's hospitality is a moment
of inspired farce from an actor of vibrant originality. He does so with a
physical abandon that leaves him flapping drunkenly on the floor like a
great bloated cockroach helplessly stranded on its back, while the assembled
worthies look on in appalled admiration. For this scene alone I would cross
London.

FT  24 APR 91 / Arts: The Barber of Seville - Barcelona

<TEXT>
Michael Hampe's Cologne production of The Barber of Seville, seen at the
Edinburgh Festival in its time and now in the hands of Hampe's colleague Kai
Luft, has made its way to the Liceu in Barcelona, where I caught the last
performance. The intimate, domestic style might have proved too low-key for
this large and splendid theatre were it not for good team-work from a fine
cast (alternatives for most of the principals) and notable support from the
much improved Liceu orchestra under Paolo Olmi. Olmi's speeds were on the
whole fast, riskily so when some of the soloists' runs threatened to turn
into slides, but only the final vaudeville, which lost its lilt and sense of
happy relaxation, was damagingly quick.
A major attraction was the appearance as Rosina of Cecilia Bartoli (sharing
the role in Barcelona with Raquel Pierotti), the young mezzo whose
recordings have made a great impression. In the theatre the volume is not so
great as the records suggest, but the vivid impact, the personality, the
rhythmic zest and the burnish on the tone are unmistakable. She recalled
Conchita Supervia at Covent Garden before the war - the sound was quite
small but every note, inflection, gesture, carried. As a comedienne Bartoli,
with her expressive features, supple movements and sure timing, is a treat
to watch.
William Matteuzzi, Bartoli's partner in a recent Barbiere recording, rightly
played Almaviva's first scene (properly handled, one of the most effective
and atmospheric openings in any opera) as a young gallant half-asleep in the
cold early morning, uncertain of his welcome. Unfortunately the stiffness
crept into his first aubade, but the second, the ravishing 'Se il mio nome",
was most delicately turned, with decorations in keeping with the sinuous
windings of the tune. Matteuzzi is an agile comedian and a good ensemble
player. Long-held high notes are on the way back, it seems. With this
singer, no regrets.
Anthony Michaels-Moore's young, fresh and likable Figaro, his warm, vigorous
baritone riding out into the theatre, reached the same high standard - no
need, though, to outpace this conductor in 'Largo al factotum'. The Bartolo,
Enrico Fissore, was gentle, restrained, almost self-effacing. In the midst
of these the ripe and rusty Basilio of Nicolay Ghiaurov, with his imposing
Slavonic bigness a potential cuckoo in the nest, was all the more effective
for his restraint. He greatly pleased a packed house.

<TEXT>
We see Betty Jones, who is 71, come up the stairs and into the bedroom,
saying: 'I was a domestic here 50 years ago - no, more than 50 years ago. I
had this terrible pain, I can remember. I came up here and I thought 'I'll
just get up on the bed'. I sat on the bed and I had this terrific pain, and
out pops this baby, and I thought 'Where's that come from?' It was fixed to
me by the cord and I thought 'I haven't got to go through life with that
fixed to me, surely?' I didn't even know I was pregnant. I was petrified.
The mistress comes in and she says 'You wicked girl, Betty, look at the mess
you've made. You've got to pay for those sheets, you're not getting any
wages'. Next thing I knew the ambulance men came and took me off to a mother
and baby's home'.
The astonishing thing about this is that Betty Jones is not an actress
delivering lines from an 18th century diary but a woman speaking to us from
her own memory. We see her in Episode 3 of the BBC2 series A Secret World Of
Sex which began last night and will continue for another five weeks. Once in
a while a series turns up, usually documentary, which really does what the
cliche says: opens a window on the world to reveal something which we may
have heard about, but had never seen clearly before.
Betty Jones's recollection typifies the way in which A Secret World Of Sex
achieves this. With a vividness and immediacy which is often enthralling,
and all too frequently painful, it uses personal witness to lay before us
the ignorance, guilt, fear and cruelty which surrounded virtually every
aspect of sex for those who grew up in the first quarter of the 20th
century. Again and again women who had never been told how pregnancy
occurred ('I thought what he was doing was just the 'in' thing') explain how
they attempted suicide rather than face the stigma of an illegitimate child.
A woman who was raped when she was 14 tells matter of factly how she could
not possibly explain this to her mother. She had a breakdown and ended up in
mental hospital.
The series was commissioned by BBC Bristol from the independent company
Domino Films, but the moving spirit behind it is Steve Humphries. Eight
years ago, as a lecturer in social history at Essex University, he began the
research work for a book. He says: 'I was curious to find out how the old,
narrow attitudes towards sex affected the lives of people brought up before
the last world war. The taboo on sex amongst that generation is still so
great that we know very little about their sexual experience. I decided that
the only way to find out what happened was to ask them before it was too
late.'
So he did, and the interviews form a major part of his book, also called A
Secret World Of Sex, which appeared in 1988 (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds
11.99). It contains many of the stories, photographs, and statistics which,
as director/producer, he has now included in the BBC series. But what the
book does not and cannot include is the tone of voice, the glint in the eye,
the defiance of those who agreed to tell their stories for his cameras.
No doubt the very fact that they did agree proves that they are atypical:
more self confident than most, a bit bolshie perhaps, in many cases
remarkably brave, even by the standards of this new age of supposed
permissiveness. It must take considerable courage for a white haired lady in
her seventies to describe in front of a film crew how her parents came home
unexpectedly when she was with her boyfriend and 'I had to push my knickers
in my handbag'. There is of course humour. Last night's opening programme
included an account from Evelyn Nelson (81) of necking in a field of long
grass when the farmer called a policeman who blew his whistle and demanded
they come out: 'It was like a football match, so many people got up'.
However, some of these first person accounts are so appalling that it is
difficult to go on watching. Yesterday's programme included the story of
Edna Higginbottom, born in 1923, who was discovered by her grandfather to be
having a sexual relationship when she was 15. He called the police who asked
'Did intercourse take place?' and upon being told 'Yes' hauled her into
court where her grandfather said 'Shut her away' and signed the necessary
papers. She was promptly locked up in a mental home and kept there for 20
years. Nor was this particularly unusual, it seems: under the 1913 Mental
Defectives Act, girls who brought shame on the family by consorting with men
were routinely locked away.
There is nothing revolutionary or, these days, even very unusual about the
way these programmes are made. My own shorthand for the technique is 'World
At War' because they employ the mixture of archive film, still photographs,
and new interviews of those with good memories which was used so powerfully
in the memorable Thames series about World War II. A Secret World Of Sex
gains greatly from a model delivery of the commentary - in other words
unselfishly unnoticeable - by Zoe Wanamaker (who recently gave such an
outstanding performance as the murderer's moll in Prime Suspect) with none
of the distracting histrionics which Laurence Olivier loaded onto The World
At War.
Each of the six episodes deals with a particular taboo: sex before marriage,
pornography and prostitution, illegitimate babies, homosexuality, sexual
violence, and VD. They are packed with memorable vignettes: the description
of men at Soho's old Windmill theatre with cameras hidden in chocolate
boxes; Lady Marguerite Tangye's account of debs' delights being aroused by
debs in the backs of cars and then resorting to the lower class gels at the
Bag O'Nails club for relief.
Some programmes are better than others, the most powerful of the lot being
the third, 'In Disgrace', which tells of five women, including Betty Jones,
who bore illegitimate babies: 'I felt like killing myself, but didn't know
how to start' . . . 'I was treated like an outcast' . . . 'My mother saw my
morning sickness and said 'Are you pregnant?' and I said 'What's pregnant?''
The wickedness of keeping young women in ignorance, and then persecuting
them for the natural results of that ignorance is enough to make you scream
with anger. However sad today's one-parent family phenomenon, it is surely
better than this hideous injustice.
But the most impressive aspect of the series is its collective strength.
Together these programmes manage to convey not just a graphic impression of
the sexual aspects of pre-war society, but a powerful sensation of how it
must have felt to live with all that guilty conscience, and terror, and
victimisation. As you listen to the self-righteous sermonising of the
religious and the 'purity league' members, it serves as a forceful reminder
of how many would still like to drag us back into that cesspit of ignorance
today. In the name of 'innocence' the moralists want to sterilise television
and push young people back into the dark. Yet it seems unlikely they will
manage it.  The most heartening aspect of this series is the character of
the people who agreed to talk to Steve Humphries. Of necessity they are in
their seventies, eighties or nineties, yet few of them look or sound
anything like that old. Perhaps an enthusiasm for sex keeps you young.
Moreover, even allowing for the fact that they are by definition the bolder
members of their generation, it is their obduracy which is so striking. As
Eastern Europeans later in the century would survive the political
totalitarianism of their societies, these Britons outlasted the moral
totalitarianism of theirs, showing that the human spirit can withstand just
about anything.

FT  24 APR 91 / Arts: Dutchman's dream of Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lure of the Classical South proved irresistible to countless generations
of Northern landscape painters inspired by Claude and Poussin to bask in the
golden light and antiquity of the Roman campagna. Claude's poetic handling
of warm southern light was to have a significant effect on the Dutch
painters who migrated south during the 1630s, '40s and '50s. It even
influenced those who stayed at home, such as Cuyp. The work of these Dutch
Italianates is perhaps the most neglected aspect of the Golden Age of Dutch
painting.
A small, predominantly loan exhibition at Richard L. Feigen &amp; Co (6 Ryder
Street, SW1, until June 7) focuses on Adam Pynacker. After Jan Both, and
along with Nicholaes Berchem, he is arguably the most important of the
second and most interesting generation of Dutch Italianate landscape
painters. The show is the first devoted to him. It serves as a reappraisal
and as a reminder of the enthusiasm for 17th century Dutch painting in
mid-18th century Britain which was to have a profound influence on the
course of landscape painting in this country, from Richard Wilson to Turner.
Pynacker's first biographer, Arnold Houbraken - his latest, Laurie Harwood,
has curated this show - states that the artist spent three years in Italy.
It seems likely that he was there 1645-48, and that he was travelling on his
father's behalf as a wine merchant. The paintings executed on his return are
the results of remembered experience.
There are 11 paintings on show. With the Dulwich Picture Gallery's 'Bridge
in an Italian Landscape' of around 1653, we catch our first glimpse of
Pynacker's mastery. The clarity of its unifying light is breathtaking. The
low-lying sun illuminates the underside of the bridge, catches the water and
spangles the slender-leafed long grasses, the tree trunks and hanging vines
with silver and gold. The muleteer and goatherd, who strike up conversation
on the bridge surrounded by their stock, are naturalistically grouped; the
figures and the dog are softly silhouetted against the bluish mountains
beyond.
Already various elements of the Pynacker repertory are established: the
serpentine contortions of the overlapping trees (derived from Both); gnarled
birch stumps invaded by fungi; and silver-tinted long grasses. An open,
luminous sky around the light source fills one half of the canvas and acts
as a foil to the dark woody hills of the other.
Pynacker is probably best known for the larger canvases he painted in
Amsterdam in the 1660s, examples of which can be seen in the Wallace
Collection (which cannot lend) and the Dulwich Picture Gallery. This small
but delightful show, especially if augmented by visits to Hertford House and
Dulwich, probably serves Pynacker better than an exhibition of 100
paintings.
Another Dulwich picture takes a bow at the National Gallery, in the first of
its new series of Brief Encounters (until April 28). The aim of the series
is to explore the relationship between two paintings closely related in
technique, style and subjectmatter, one from the permanent collection and
the other a loan. What better start than the Samson and Delilahs by Rubens
and his disciple Van Dyck, the latter seen for the first time in Britain
since its cleaning for the recent exhibition in Washington.
Mantegna's treatment of the subject is misogynous; Rembrandt's is brutal;
Rubens, in contrast, allows Delilah a moment of reflection. The shorn hero
is still asleep in her arms, the soldiers at the door. She looks down at her
doomed lover with an expression of triumph tinged with tenderness and a hint
of regret. The pose of the two figures echoes a pieta.
Rubens painted this glowing, opulent and dramatic tour-de-force after his
return from Italy, in 1609. A decade later, the 20-year-old Van Dyck
borrowed the composition and reversed it. In every respect, his reworking of
the subject makes for a disappointing contrast. Rubens's penetrating
psychology is lost. He was to prove much better at being Van Dyck than
Rubens.

FT  24 APR 91 / Business and the Environment: UK's new pollution inspector
puts industry under scrutiny - John Hunt meets David Slater, who takes up
the position next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The job of policing new environmental controls over a large section of
British industry will be taken over next week by David Slater, a consultant
from the private sector. He succeeds Frank Feates, who is retiring as chief
inspector of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution.
HMIP is implementing a new system of integrated pollution control (IPC),
which some companies fear will require them to shoulder a heavy financial
burden in order to meet the new standards. This programme commenced on April
1 and will be introduced in stages.
The engineering and chemical industries have been particularly concerned
about the introduction of Batneec (which stands for the 'best available
techniques not entailing excessive cost'). It is the central part of the new
system of pollution control.
Big plants such as engineering and chemical works and refineries will be
obliged to conform with Batneec by introducing tougher measures over the
next four years. Industry has complained that it has little information on
what this will mean in practice for specific processes and has been alarmed
that it could entail heavy capital investment.
But Slater believes Batneec should be seen as a positive way of improving
standards so that environmental damage can be avoided. He sees Batneec and
the Environmental Protection Act as 'very good conceptually, a great advance
pointing the way that legislation will be going in the rest of the world'.
He is also confident that the 'green' message is getting through to business
and industry. 'In some of these big companies you are starting to see the
effect,' he says. 'There is a big emphasis on management improving the
safety of their processes. It is in the company's interests to be viewed as
environmentally friendly. It is a big commercial advantage.'
From experience, Slater has seen what can happen when things go wrong at
large industrial plants. He is a founding director of Technica, consultant
scientists and engineers, where he has worked on environmental studies and
risk assessment. Previously he was with Cremer and Warner, consulting
engineers.
He has been involved in studying the huge chemical explosion at Flixborough,
Humberside, which killed 29 people in 1974, the chemical plant accident at
Seveso, Italy, the Union Carbide disaster at Bhopal, India, and a study on
the Exxon Valdez disaster.
He believes that industry has learnt the lessons of these events and has
developed a range of management tools such as risk analysis, environmental
impact assessments and environmental audits.
'There is no such thing as a completely pollution free or completely safe
process. But you can minimise the risk through good design. There has been a
big push towards quality in industrial processes. If you improve quality it
is a safer company, a cleaner company and it makes a profit.'
The UK Government has been under attack for failing to provide enough staff
and resources for the inspectorate to carry out its enhanced role.
Integrated pollution control means that the branches of the old
inspectorates covering pollution of air, water and land have been merged
into one organisation embracing all these areas. There has been some
in-fighting between the different disciplines as the new There have also
been complaints that salaries have been inadequate to attract staff of
sufficient quality.
But the Government has now increased staffing and salaries and Feates will
hand over the inspectorate to Slater in better shape than when he took over.
Slater believes that salaries, up to Pounds 32,900 for a new inspector are
now competitive with outside industry. When jobs were advertised recently
more than 600 applications poured in. 'These are very encouraging signs,' he
says.
He is confident that morale has improved at the inspectorate. 'It has to be
professional, credible, competent and independent and I am sure it is going
to be that way.
'There are a lot of very good inspectors out there at the sharp end. They
have the industrial expertise and they know what the problems and
practicalities are.'
The inspectorate is to be given agency status so that it can operate more
flexibly and at arm's length from government. Slater welcomes this: 'It
makes a lot of sense, it is a natural evolution.'
He is cautious, however, over suggestions that Britain might eventually need
a powerful independent agency to act as a 'green' policeman along the lines
of the US Environmental Protection Agency.
In recent years Slater has been in charge of Technica's US operation and his
experience has made him sceptical of importing the US model. He found the
American system to be adversarial and believes the mechanisms now being
introduced by the Government may fit better into the British scene.
He emphasises that the inspectorate is prepared to listen to the problems of
industry but cannot take on the role of a commercial consultancy advising
companies. 'That is not good for industry,' he says. 'They have to develop
their own expertise.'
On the one hand the new pollution control regime has been criticised by some
sections of industry for being too tough. On the other it has been attacked
by the environmental movement as too weak.
Slater is philosophical about this. 'If you do your job properly you may end
up being somewhat unpopular with both sides,' he says. 'But at the end of
the day the public needs to rely on the credibility and competence of the
organisation.'

FT  24 APR 91 / Business and the Environment: Looking for a quiet life -
Jamie Allen reports on measures by the Hong Kong government to reduce the
colony's noise level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMIE ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong has been called many mysterious and laudable things, including
Fragrant Harbour and Pearl of the Orient. It has never officially been named
Construction Site, although this comes closer to what it is like to live in
the cramped and frenetic territory than any euphemism can manage.
Walking along a footpath involves dodging jackhammers, crossing a road
entails negotiating temporary wooden planks over works' sites, and living
next to a new building site could well mean you never need worry about
sleeping through your alarm clock.
But coming to terms with the problem of noise has been a long, slow struggle
in Hong Kong. Unlike Japan, which enacted its first environmental laws in
1967 and a noise regulation law the following year, Hong Kong did not enact
its first comprehensive Noise Control Ordinance until 1988 and construction
activities did not come under control until 1989. (They are still not fully
under control).
While Japan has banned the worst form of percussive piling - the diesel
hammer - in Tokyo and several other cities, Hong Kong has chosen not to
bring in sweeping regulations which rule out the use of specific pieces of
machinery.
Usually pragmatic in its dealings with industry over environmental matters,
the Hong Kong Government devised legislation which contained incentives for
contractors to switch from the noisiest type of percussive piling (the
diesel hammer) to quieter methods of both percussive and non-percussive
piling.
Quieter percussive methods include the hydraulic hammer and the drop hammer,
while non-percussive methods include hand-dug caissons (wells dug by hand
into which reinforced concrete is put) and mechanically bored piles (hollow
columns made by drills which grind and/or break the rock into which
reinforcement is put).
The system, which was implemented in late 1989, offers percussive piling
operators three kinds of daily permits - a three-hour permit for piling
operations which are unacceptably noisy (those which exceed the accepted
noise level for an area by more than 10 decibels); a five-hour permit for
those which are moderately noisy (those which exceed the level by between
one and 10 decibels); and a full 12-hour permit for piling operations which
do not exceed the acceptable noise level.
An added incentive is that quiet piling methods are permitted to run all
night, while the hours of operation for the three- and five-hour permits are
not chosen to the convenience of the contractor, but by the Environmental
Protection Department.
As time costs money and as construction deadlines are tight in Hong Kong,
the aim was to make noisy piling a frustrating, inefficient and uneconomic
proposition. The controls have brought about some improvements in the
thinking and behaviour of the construction industry in Hong Kong - it has
encouraged some of the larger contractors to test quieter methods of piling
and suppliers such as Daido of Japan and BSP of Britain to try to sell new
and more sophisticated piling technology to the local market.
According to one of the largest local suppliers of construction equipment,
China Engineers, the controls have also caused the sales of new diesel
hammers to dry up in the last few years.
But statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection Department present
something of a dilemma - the number of three-hour permits has not declined
during 1990, meaning the incentive scheme is not working or at least not as
quickly as it was intended to.
On Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, the two most built-up parts of Hong Kong
and hence the most 'noise sensitive', the combined number of three-hour
permits in each quarter last year was, respectively, 60, 70, 58, 60. In the
New Territories, the rural/new urban development part of Hong Kong, the
permit numbers were 19, 23, 16, 12.
Even more discouraging is the fact that the total number of three-hour
permits (318) exceeded the total number of five-hour and 12-hour permits
combined (276). But the Environmental Protection Department does not feel
defeated by these statistics and believes contractors are going through a
transition period. It will soon carry out a survey to ask contractors
whether they are planning to use quieter methods.
Andrew Kwan Siu-hei, acting principal environmental protection officer in
the Noise Control Group, said many of Hong Kong's contractors are small
operators who are reluctant to change their work practices and reluctant to
buy new equipment. 'Maybe they (the small contractors) are used to the old
technology. Better to let large contractors test new methods. I think sooner
or later they will change,' said Kwan.
Construction industry representatives say the issue is complicated and that
the problem lies with Hong Kong's outdated building regulations. These
regulations are enforced by another government department, the Buildings and
Lands Department, whose record of co-operation with the Environmental
Protection Department is less than good.
Although the regulations are about to be revised, so far they have
undermined the success of the incentive scheme. Rod Buckell, technical
manager with the piling company Franki Kier and chairman of the
environmental committee of the Hong Kong Construction Association, said
contractors would change overnight if the financial incentive was there.
The reason they did not was because an outdated formula governing pile
driving in the building regulations makes it cheaper to use diesel hammers
rather than hydraulic hammers, which would be given a five-hour permit under
the Hong Kong system. Contractors cannot simply switch to bored piles for
every job because they mostly follow tender designs drawn up by engineers
and because the type of piling used depends on a number of factors,
primarily cost, time, the size and type of site, and the weight of the
building being erected.
'Quietness has nothing to do with the design of piling in Hong Kong. Cost is
paramount,' said Buckell. There is one area, however, where the new piling
controls are having a definite beneficial effect - the ability to pile all
night with quiet methods. Buckell said this has made bored piling using new
and sophisticated equipment more economic than it was before and has helped
to loosen the hold percussive or 'driven piling' has on the industry.
'By limiting the number of hours driven can work, bored is now economic,'
said Buckell. He estimates the permit system has increased the cost of
driven piling (using steel piles) by about 10 to 15 per cent. But Buckell
also asks, why use piles at all for the foundations of buildings?
The cutting edge of foundation work these days in Hong Kong and countries
such as France, Germany and Canada is a method called 'deep compaction'. The
soil is compacted almost back into its rocky state by vibration using steel
pokers or is pressed down under the impact of a heavy mass. It is useful for
land reclamation work, of which Hong Kong will be doing a lot over the next
10 years, and at HKDollars 15 (Pounds 1) per cubic metre it costs about half
the price of piling.
Its main drawbacks are that it can only be done on sand - not on mud - and
the height of buildings above is limited to about 11 storeys. Yet it is not
hard to see that 'deep compaction' could have wide application throughout
Asia, especially in countries where earthquake problems limit the height of
buildings, such as in Taiwan, or in developing countries which do not need
to build skyscrapers.

FT  24 APR 91 / Jobs: Consultant discovers surprising differences between
candidates either side of 40 - Fresh light on the age-barrier paradox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LAST the Jobs column has been supplied with a clue to a question that has
mystified it these past 18 years or more. Why do senior executives, mostly
aged at least 40, typically resist taking on people over 40 to work for them
as executives?
The reason usually cited for refusing to recruit same is that folk of such
advanced years are no longer up to the work. But that surely rebounds
awkwardly on the executives doing the recruiting. So unless there is
evidence that the 'past-it' clause does not apply to 40-pluses already
ranked as seniors (and I've never seen any) we would seem to be faced with a
paradox.
Fortunately, a way out has been found by recruiter Barrie Whitaker of the
consultancy arm of Price Waterhouse. His work entails assessing
job-candidates by a variety of measures - tests of verbal and numerical
reasoning, and of personality, as well as 'in-tray' exercises  - and he has
lately compared the under-40s' results with those of their elders.
So far, only one occupational group has provided him with enough candidates
for the findings to be statistically respectable. It consists of finance
executives, of whom he has tested 100 on the right side of the age bar, and
77 on the wrong side. But he says the results are similar for other types
such as general managers and personnel and production people.
A further thing that proved much the same was the reasoning-test performance
of the under- and over-40s. Apart from a marginal lead for the younger set
on the numerical measure, there was no difference between them.
Where the two age-groups did contrast was in persuasiveness, friendliness,
decisiveness and astuteness. The oldies came out stronger on all those
counts, which would apparently give them an edge in the job of managing.
Nevertheless there were other factors which cast light on their unpopularity
as executive recruits. For example, the oldies were more critical and
controlling than the younger set, and less democratic, practical and
conscientious in sticking to boring, repetitive tasks.
Hence it seems that, at the same time as being better equipped to work as
managers, the over-40s are more difficult to manage. But that still leaves
the question why senior executives of comparable years are averse to taking
on the challenge of managing them.
The answer, Barrie Whitaker thinks, lies in another unexpected difference he
has found between the two age-groups. The over-40s are more competitive. So
senior recruiters, being of that nature themselves, probably see similarly
inclined as well as better equipped older candidates as a greater threat to
them in their own positions.
NOW to the table below, which gives indications of the pay prospects held
out by different kinds of specialist work in the United Kingdom. The figures
come from the latest survey made for the British Institute of Management by
the Remuneration Economics consultancy.
Dated at January 1, the study covered 24,651 middle- and upper-ranked staff
in 385 widely varied organisations throughout the UK, which together employ
over a tenth of the country's workforce. Anyone wanting the weighty report,
which costs Pounds 325, should contact Peter Stevens of the consultancy at
51 Portland Rd, Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey KT1 2SH; tel 081-549 8726, fax
081-541 5705.
My table is confined to 11 specialisms commonly found in companies, and in
each case shows the average total money pay - bonuses and such besides
salaries - at seven levels of seniority from director downwards. Except for
'Management services' which includes information technology, and 'Company
secretary' which covers in-house legal services, the specialisms should need
no further explanation.
As may be seen, the one with the best top pay is financial management. But
measured by the average prospects across all seven ranks, it is second to
the company secretarial area. Third by the same measure comes marketing
followed by management services, R and D, personnel, sales, engineering
design etc, purchasing, distribution, and manufacturing.
FINALLY to four jobs. All are being handled by headhunters who may not
identify their clients. They therefore promise to abide by applicants'
requests not to be named to the employer at this stage of the proceedings.
The first pair, being offered through Brian Standring, are for technical
services managers initially based near London with a probability, though no
certainty, of transfer to central Africa. They will work for an
international group making and distributing products including food and
beverages, and will be responsible for efficient and profitable production.
The more senior will require higher-level experience than the second. But
both must be engineers who understand finance as well as up-to-date
production methods such as total quality management and just-in-time
manufacturing. They need to be French-speaking too.
Salaries plus bonuses Pounds 46,000 and Pounds 35,000 respectively. Cars and
stock-options among perks.
Inquiries to the Standring Partnership, 83 Wycombe Rd, Marlow,
Buckinghamshire SL7 3HZ; tel 0628 471185, fax 0628 482240.
The other two jobs are in the London options-sales team of an international
bank, and are offered through recruiter John Williams of Russell, Williams
and Associates (45 St Mary's Rd, London W5 5RQ; tel 081-579 1082, fax
081-566 2024).
Both posts need high numeracy, with one also requiring success in marketing
currency options, and the other the same in marketing interest-rate options
with emphasis on caps and floors.
Salaries about Pounds 30,000 with bonus on results, and cars.

FT  24 APR 91 / FT Law Report: Negligent valuer pays no damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWINGCASTLE v GIBSON House of Lords (Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Brightman,
Lord Griffiths, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton and Lord Lowry): April 18 1991
A MORTGAGEE who lends in reliance on a negligent valuer's report, and who
would not have lent but for that report, cannot claim damages from the
valuer for loss of contractual interest due from the borrower on the loan
sum if the borrower defaults. But, in addition to the difference between
sums paid out and sums recovered, he can claim interest at a commercial rate
on the loan sum, to compensate for the time he was deprived of its use.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the defendant valuer,
Mr Alastair Gibson, a chartered surveyor, from a Court of Appeal decision
(FT, April 6 1990) upholding a County court assessment of Pounds 7,136
damages owed by him to the plaintiff, Swingcastle Ltd.
LORD LOWRY said that at the beginning of 1985 Mr John Clarke and his wife
were in financial difficulties. Their home was mortgaged. They owed Pounds
1,700 to a building society and Pounds 6,300 to a finance company.
Being anxious to pay off those debts, they went to brokers whose business
included putting borrowers in touch with lenders.
The brokers instructed the valuer to survey the property and give a report
for the benefit of whoever might become their lending principals.
The valuer placed the forced sale value at Pounds 18,000. Relying on his
valuation, Swingcastle lent Mr and Mrs Clarke Pounds 10,000 secured by a
first charge over the property.
The entire loan was used to pay the Pounds 1,700 and Pounds 6,300 debts, and
the Pounds 2,000 brokers' fee.
The loan was repayable by 120 monthly instalments at 36.51 per cent annual
interest. If the borrowers went into arrears, the lenders were entitled to
add outstanding interest to the principal sum and charge interest on the
whole, at 45.619 per cent.
The borrowers quickly fell into arrears and surrendered possession on June
30 1986. The lenders sold the property for Pounds 12,000. Completion took
place on February 27 1987. On September 4 1987 the lenders issued a writ
against Mr Gibson, claiming damages for loss allegedly sustained by them in
reliance on his negligent valuation.
They pleaded loss comprised of Pounds 19,912.96, being the 'amount required
to redeem the loan as at February 27 1987', Pounds 401.35 estate agents'
fees, and Pounds 983.25 legal costs. Those sums, less the Pounds 12,000 sale
proceeds totalled Pounds 9,297.56.
Liability was admitted in the County court and it was admitted that but for
the valuer's negligence the lenders would not have made any loan to the
borrowers. The sole issue was the measure of damages on the basis that, on a
competent valuation the lenders would have made no loan.
About some of the figures there was no dispute. The lenders' outgoings
included the Pounds 10,000, the Pounds 401.35 and the Pounds 983.25. On the
other side of the account, the lenders had received Pounds 1,734 from the
borrowers between February 1985 and April 1986, and Pounds 12,000 from the
purchasers of the property.
The disputed ingredient was the Pounds 19,912.96.
The lenders arrived at that figure by calculating the amount of principal
and interest outstanding, having regard to the initial 36.51 per cent rate,
and the 45.619 per cent penal rate.
In the County court Judge Harris QC allowed the claim and gave judgment for
Pounds 7,136.41 with interest and costs.
The valuer's case was that damages should have been assessed on the basis
that the lenders were entitled to be placed in the position that they would
have been in if they had received a competent valuer's report and had
consequently made no loan.
He said damages were to be calculated on the footing that the lenders should
(1) take credit for the Pounds 10,000, the Pounds 401.35, and the Pounds
983.25; and (2) give credit for Pounds 1,734 paid and Pounds 12,000 received
on sale of the property; and that the lenders had for two years been
deprived of the use of Pounds 10,000 which they would not have lent but for
the negligent valuation.
In the court of Appeal Lord Justice Neill reviewed a number of authorities
including Baxter v Gapp (1939) 2KB 271 which had been successfully relied on
in the County court. He concluded Baxter was binding and that the judge was
right to assess the damages in the way that he did.
He then considered the case as if it were free from authority.
He began with the principle in Livingstone v Rawyards (1880) 5 App Cas
25,39, that damages should 'put the party who has been injured . . . in the
same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong'.
He said that where a client would not have lent at all but for the negligent
valuation, a number of approaches to assessment were possible. One was that
the lender could be awarded unpaid interest owed when the security was
realised. That was the method adopted in Baxter.
But, said Lord Justice Neill, 'to award damages on this basis is in effect
to treat the valuer as the guarantor of the contract of loan'. In the
absence of authority he would have rejected that solution.
Other methods, he said, were to award a sum equivalent to what the money
would have earned as interest on another loan, or on deposit or if invested
elsewhere. Whether any of those methods suited a case would depend on the
evidence.
Baxter was regarded by all three members of the Court of Appeal as authority
for accepting the lenders' approach to the claim for interest.
In Baxter, (1) the trial judge calculated interest by reference to what the
mortgagor had failed to pay under her contract; but (2) the appropriate rate
of interest was never an issue between the parties or in the mind of the
court. The real issue was whether the plaintiff could recover consequential
loss.
Having regard to point (1), the case was almost by accident an authority for
the proposition by which the Court of Appeal in the present case found
itself reluctantly bound.
Baxter was not an attractive precedent. The approach seemed contrary to
principle. The aggrieved party was entitled to be placed in the same
position as if the wrong had not occurred, not to receive compensation for
lost interest at the contractual rate.
The valuer's approach in the present case, and Lord Justice Neill's
analysis, were correct.
What the lenders lost was the use of the Pounds 10,000 while locked up in
the loan.
There was no cut and dry solution to calculating the amount of damages in
cases of this kind. It depended on the evidence.
The lenders ought to have presented their claim on the basis that, if the
valuer had advised properly, they would not have lent the money. Where they
went wrong was to claim that the valuer deprived them of interest they would
have received if the borrowers had paid up. The fallacy of their case was
that they had been trying to obtain compensation for the borrowers' failure,
not damages for the valuer's negligence.
Taking Pounds 10,000, Pounds 401.35 and Pounds 983.25 on one side, and
Pounds 12,000 and Pounds 1,734 on the other, the lenders were Pounds
2,349.40 in credit.
In the absence of evidence as to how the lenders financed the loan or how
the money, if not lent, could have been profitably employed, 12 per cent
interest was the proper rate at which to recompense the lenders for being
deprived of their Pounds 10,000. Two years would yield Pounds 2,400, but one
might ask whether it was reasonable for the valuer to bear liability to date
of sale in February 1987, the property having been surrendered in June 1986.
It was for the lenders to prove their case. They had not appeared. In the
light of that fact and the figures, it would not be fair or sensible to
remit the action to the County court for new assessment.
The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed.
For Mr Gibson: Roger Toulson QC and Roger Stewart (Reynolds Porter
Chamberlain).
Swingcastle was not represented.

FT  24 APR 91 / Management: The struggle to breach the Whitehall Wall -
Government and industry must both play their part
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Geoffrey Morgan was plucked from the ranks of the civil service as a
potential high-flyer and seconded for two years to Guinness's brewing
operations, his arrival at the company's reception desk set the alarm bells
ringing.
His induction into Guinness 20 years ago provided him with his first
experience of the mutual suspicions which separate Whitehall from the world
of business. 'I turned up with my official briefcase and the gate-keeper
immediately alerted the staff that Customs and Excise were on the premises.
The company was not up to anything but it liked to be prepared when
officialdom called. I was quickly given a less formal-looking briefcase.'
Though Whitehall-wise, Morgan was naive when it came to the business world
and jumped at the opportunity to see it from the inside. He was astonished
at the lack of paperwork and what he saw as the simplicity of the company's
objectives - 'selling more beer'.
By contrast, helping to run a country, he suggests, without any attempt to
belittle the daily challenges confronting industry, can be quite
complicated.
His remarks offer an insight into the cultural differences which have long
separated public service and private enterprise and which many believe
could, if more effectively bridged, help improve Britain's economic
performance.
By spending time with Guinness, Morgan climbed over what the Public Policy
Unit has just dubbed the 'Whitehall Wall' - the barrier between government
and industry. According to PPU, which monitors and advises on government
policy, the wall is built squarely on lack of understanding, poor
explanation and invariably unhelpful attitudes.
A PPU report, published by the Bow Group, the centre-right think tank,
concludes that the government's outlook remains steadfastly inward. It
claims that Whitehall, despite the phased introduction of private sector
disciplines into its revenue-raising operations, has barely started to
comprehend the needs of the enterprise culture which its recent political
masters have tried to spread.
Industry, on the other hand, is accused of paying scant attention to the
process of policy-making and of invariably leaving responsibility for
dealing with government in the hands of unsuitable employees. Companies are
urged to regard the task of enlightening government about their activities
as a duty and social responsibility.
The system of civil service recruitment does not help. The Civil Service
Selection Board, which interviews all the most promising entrants, has no
brief to foster either commercial disciplines or greater empathy between
government and governed. Only one in a thousand of those officials entering
a Whitehall department at the first level of middle management has any
working experience of a commercial environment.
The PPU says that the 'bottom line' to businessmen is financial; their
frustration is with officials who draft policy without fully appreciating
the market consequences of their actions.
Top-ranking civil servants are portrayed in the same mould as judges, almost
exclusively receiving their training in a cloistered environment both
technically and culturally removed from the world over which they may
exercise profound influence.
Lord Young, the former Trade and Industry Secretary, criticises the lack of
two-way traffic: 'Where are the very best of civil servants, who leave and
go into industry in their early forties, as the French do as a matter of
course? How many in our great companies have the faintest idea how
government really works? One or two, not more.
'We practice a doctrine of separation of experience that appears absolute.
Then we wonder why it is that government has an imperfect understanding of
the needs of commerce and industry.'
Progress towards overcoming the ghetto mentality between public and private
sectors has been more marked in other, often more vibrant, economies.
In Japan, for example, large numbers of 'Amagari' - or high-flyers - are
continually seconded from companies to spend up to two years in government
ministries, which command a far greater status in the eyes of businessmen
than is the case in Britain.
In France, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration provides civil servants with
contextual training intended to provide them with appropriate industrial and
business skills. Critics even suggest the system has gone too far, with the
development of equally critical political skills invariably neglected.
Sporadic attempts in Britain to enhance co-operation and understanding
between both sides have been under way since 1968. The initiative was
revitalised in 1989 by Lord Young as Trade and Industry Secretary with the
launch of the Bridge programme.
After his spell in the brewing industry, Geoffrey Morgan is now an
under-secretary in the Cabinet Office and the man primarily responsible for
secondment.
The British programme is essentially intended for 'rising stars' on both
sides. Larger, better-resourced companies tend to dominate the programme but
smaller companies are now being encouraged.
While many civil servants opt to join companies, as opposed to business
support organisations or financial institutions, they rarely express an
interest in manufacturing businesses. Among the most popular Whitehall
destinations for corporate employees are the 'economic' departments like the
Treasury, DTI and Energy.
In 1989, the Department of Trade and Industry, which employs 12,000 people
and is charged with 'assisting the process of wealth creation', despatched
41 people to join the wealth-creators. The DTI played host to 46
businessmen.
The total secondment programme during 1989 saw a total of 627 longer-term
placings on both sides of the Whitehall Wall, along with another 550
short-term attachments. At the same time, 69 civil servants took up
non-executive directorships with companies.
A separate, 'short-stay' arrangement, operated by the Whitehall and Industry
Group - a joint venture between industrialists and the Cabinet Office -
enables high-calibre civil servants to spend up to three weeks with
companies, participating at the highest levels of decision-making.
But the strong emphasis placed on quality rather than quantity for the
overall secondment programme cannot fully disguise some disappointment
within government and beyond over the still-limited scale of the initiative.
The Royal Institute of Public Administration, which is concerned with policy
making and administration in the public sector, has joined calls for the
secondment programme to be expanded and given a higher status by both sides
and deplores the sort of attitude which means some companies leave the job
to their community affairs or charity sections.
Chris Bright, a competition lawyer with Linklaters &amp; Paines, the solicitors,
recently finished a two-year spell with the Department of Trade and Industry
and enthusiastically supports the initiative. 'My view of the civil service
changed markedly. I got fed up being accused of working from ten o'clock
until four; the reality was that I had never worked harder in my life.'
Though full of admiration for the expertise and dedication of the senior
civil servants with whom he worked, Bright has some kindly criticism.
'There is a tendency for people within government departments to over-focus
on particular issues. They do not always get the broader picture and fail to
appreciate the wider impact of the decisions they take.'
Bright also believes that too many civil servants remain over-sensitive
about publicly imparting information and are suspicious of any scheme which
lifts the veil: 'The inbuilt perception among some public servants that the
people should not know certain things is a mentality that must be addressed
and overcome.'
Susan Gardiner left Customs and Excise to spend two years with P&amp;0
Containers and says the experience broadened her entire approach to
decision-making. She says she is 'far more willing to be optimistic' about
resolving problems.
She does not believe, however, that the ethos of private sector management
can necessarily be transferred into the civil service, where a wider,
political perspective is necessary.
Gardiner would like to see the secondment programme extended but says
industry, too, has to be willing to participate. Businesses might not, she
suggests, always demonstrate the sort of broader, long-term view such a
commitment demands.
Given a civil service more than half a million strong, the Cabinet Office
hopes the current rate of secondments can be stepped up. In the meantime,
one of its biggest challenges is to find companies prepared to take Inland
Revenue staff; the quest for mutual understanding does, apparently, have
some boundaries.

FT  24 APR 91 / Management: A quinquennial solution to a perennial problem -
Corporate governance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a mechanism for disciplining bad management, the hostile takeover has its
attractions. But it can be overdone. When the market for corporate control
becomes over-heated, as it did in the mid-1980s, assets are shuffled and
re-shuffled for short-term gain and sound companies are damaged in the
process. Can anything be done to limit the intensity of the next takeover
wave?
The outcome of takeover contests would be more rational if the opportunistic
element were reduced and the principal actors - above all, the institutional
investors whose votes are usually crucial - were forced to focus on the
long-term prospects of the companies concerned. At present, as in the
NCR-AT&amp;T case in the US, investors have to sort their way through a stream
of one-sided propaganda, accompanied by a series of legal manoeuvres as the
contestants seek to gain advantage.
In these circumstances it is hard to answer the fundamental question - how
well has the defendant management been doing and what is it likely to
achieve in the future.
One of the merits of the proposal put forward last year by two American
lawyers, Martin Lipton and Steven Rosenblum*, is that it offers a more
orderly framework in which takeover decisions can be taken. Directors of
public companies would be judged on their performance over five years. At
each quinquennial meeting they would offer themselves for re-election on the
basis of a detailed account of their stewardship over the preceding five
years and their plans for the next five; past performance and future
projections would be subject to an appraisal carried out by an independent
investment bank or consulting firm. Hostile bids could only be considered at
the quinquennial meeting; directors would be free from takeover threats in
the interim, but their jobs would clearly be on the line at the end of each
five-year period.
This approach meets the desire of managers not to be judged solely on
short-term financial results, but without making their lives too
comfortable. They would have to be more open and explicit about their
forward plans; their ability to fulfil those plans would be exposed to
rigorous public scrutiny.
Institutional shareholders
The usual reaction of City practitioners to the Lipton-Rosenblum paper is
polite indifference: do we really need to tear up the existing system just
because of a few takeover excesses? But a virtue of the proposal is that it
builds on existing arrangements for reporting to shareholders.
Unlike most other proposals for reform, it does not have unrealistic
expectations about changing the behaviour of non-executive directors or
institutional shareholders. Most institutions have neither the resources nor
the motivation to become 'interested owners', monitoring companies on a
continuous basis; it is not obvious that the management of those companies
would be improved if they did so.
But shareholders do need reliable information on which to base investment
judgments. Just as the proposed accounting changes in the UK would improve
the quality of financial information, so the Lipton-Rosenblum reforms would
provide better insight into overall corporate objectives and performance.
The proposals do involve restrictions in the free market for corporate
control. But takeovers, especially those involving large companies, are
important events with economic and social repercussions. It is right that
contested bids should be decided only after the most careful consideration.
The argument is not that the market for corporate control should cease to
exist - it remains an important source of flexibility in the Anglo-American
capitalist system - but that the rules governing its operation should be
tightened in a way which makes bad takeovers less likely. The quinquennial
proposal involves a skilful trade-off between the interests of managers,
investors and society as a whole. It does so by uniting boards of directors
and shareholders behind what ought to be the primary goal of the enterprise
 -to maximise profits over the long term.

Chicago Law Review, Vol 58, No 1, Winter 1991.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
UNIONS organising in the public sector should be prepared to be flexible
about traditional bargaining structures to allow better delivery of
services, a senior TUC official said yesterday.
In a study of how unions can help improve standards in public services, Mr
Bill Callaghan, TUC assistant general secretary, said unions needed to take
'a bold and innovative stance' and allow devolution of power.
Mr Callaghan was writing in a policy paper published by the Institute for
Public Policy Research, a left-wing research group, and the TUC. The paper
said unions should accept that competitive tendering could be good for
services.
The paper includes other contributions questioning whether unions should
change policies. It is intended as a stimulus to the Labour party and unions
to review attitudes to how public services are delivered.
The contribution of unions to better delivery of public services is highly
sensitive for Labour because of the role of public-sector strikes in 1979 in
bringing down the last Labour government.
The paper was welcomed by Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, chairman of the TUC's
economic committee, who said unions did not 'want everything back the way it
was a decade or more ago'. He said they could not simply defend the status
quo.
Mr Callaghan said there was no longer a consensus in the labour movement in
favour of direct employment of labour by councils in all cases. The case in
favour of direct employment would have to be made in a more sophisticated
manner.
In another contribution, Mr John Stewart, head of the school of public
policy at Birmingham University, said that a form of public service more
accountable to people would require a new degree of flexibility among staff.
He said existing bargaining structures created barriers that prevented
manual workers' full potential from being realised, and unions had to be
prepared to negotiate new terms and conditions.

FT  24 APR 91 / Audit Office faults NHS local autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Health Service's Pounds 4bn-a-year supplies operation could
benefit from management techniques used by companies such as Boots and Marks
and Spencer, the National Audit Office says today.
An NAO study of the management of complex operations in private-sector
companies showed that the NHS's approach differed sharply 'in nearly every
respect'. In particular, the NAO report says, none of 16 private companies
surveyed 'permitted local autonomy on the scale allowed throughout the NHS'.
The report's conclusion that decentralised structures have prevented the NHS
from maximising its purchasing efficiency comes when the government's health
reforms, introduced this month, are encouraging still more local autonomy in
many areas of the health service.
The NAO examined how Boots, Marks and Spencer and Compass Services UK, a
contract caterer, handled their equivalent of the NHS supplies organisation,
which provides hospitals with food, bedding and equipment.
Between them the three companies supply about 4,000 delivery points and, the
NAO says, 'face similar logistic challenges' as the NHS. In addition, a
consultants' report was commissioned on 13 other private companies in
manufacturing, food processing and retailing.
A fundamental difference between the public and private sectors was the
greater emphasis placed by the private companies on central control. They
also made greater use of information technology to help manage their
supplies operations, and had management information 'on tap', with senior
managers exercising close oversight of activities.
The report concludes that the NHS supplies organisation 'does not apply
financial and commercial disciplines which are common in the private
sector'.
It demonstrates differences of view between the NAO and the Department of
Health over the value of devolving decision-making on purchasing. The NAO
says the 'variety of decentralised structures' in the NHS had led to
fragmented purchasing, making it unlikely that operating costs would be
minimised and purchasing power maximised. The Department of Health argued
that decentralised structures offered 'positive advantages such as local
accessibility and ownership'.
The NAO said the most significant need was for more positive strategic
oversight by senior management.
Department of Health officials told the NAO that, while recognising some of
the points raised, 'private-sector practice was not necessarily appropriate
for adoption by the NHS as the businesses were different in many respects'.

RECORD numbers of power stations are being built in England and Wales, the
seven-year statement issued by the National Grid Company disclosed
yesterday.
Nine new stations, with a total capacity of 7,400MW, have signed agreements
for connection to the national electricity grid, NGC said.
New stations planned by National Power and PowerGen, the two large
generators, account for about 3,000MW of the new capacity. The rest is being
built by independent power projects, notably the ICI and Enron consortium,
which is planning an 1,875MW station on Teesside.
The new plant would mean about 35 per cent spare capacity on the system,
compared with an ideal surplus of about 24 per cent. That high margin would
be likely to force old stations to close, NGC said. It had taken into
account peak electricity demand expectations, which it predicted would rise
from 49,200MW in the year ending March 1992 to 52,000MW in the year ending
March 1998. These forecasts were broadly unchanged from those in the last
seven-year statement.
Mr John Uttley, the NGC's finance director, said the company was spending
more on infrastructure and less on refurbishment as a result of the many new
stations joining the grid. NGC could afford the capital, he said. He
expected capital expenditure to rise from Pounds 300m in the year ending
March 1991 to Pounds 400m in the following year. That would accord broadly
with expectations at the time of the electricity flotation, Mr Uttley said.

FT  24 APR 91 / Lamont shifts emphasis of economic monitoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday announced two fundamental shifts
of emphasis in the Treasury's monitoring of the economy.
In a speech to the annual convention of the Institute of Directors, Mr
Lamont acknowledged that official economic data would continue to signal
that the UK was in recession in spite of the output recovery expected to
begin in the second half of the year.
At the same time, underlying inflation - as measured by the retail prices
index, excluding mortgage interest payments and the community charge - would
be 'meaningless in the coming year' as a result of the changes to the poll
tax and VAT announced in the Budget.
To track underlying inflation, the Treasury would monitor closely the RPI
less mortgage interest payments. That would recognise the largely offsetting
nature of the partial taxation switch from community charge to VAT and
exclude the volatility from changes in interest rates.
To assess the shape of the recovery, the Treasury would focus on anecdotal
surveys of consumer and business confidence, as they had given the best
early warnings of the recession which started in the middle of last year. In
general, forecasts - which rely more on economic statistics - failed to
predict the recession.
Mr Lamont said he was sceptical towards forecasts but had a lot of respect
for data. Lagging indicators of the economy - such as unemployment figures -
would continue to signal recession for some time after the recovery had
begun.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Independent commission planned - Local
Government Structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT-appointed Local Government Commission will be established to
prepare for changes in the structure of English councils from April 1994.
The commission, while independent, will operate within guidelines designed
to achieve government intentions of replacing the present two-tier structure
of county and district councils with unitary authorities.
Single-tier authorities, says the government's consultation paper published
yesterday, would produce 'more efficient and more accountable local
government' and reflect people's sense of identity with their communities.
There will be no wholesale abolition of existing county or district
councils, although the consultation document makes clear the government's
intention to move towards unitary authorities. 'In some places, it may be
best for existing authorities to be merged; in others the best approach may
be to create or recreate quite different authorities. In some areas there
could be a case for two tiers. The aim will be to achieve the structure
which best matches the particular circumstances of each area.'
Under the present two-tier system, the paper says, there was often confusion
over which authority was responsible for providing a particular service.
Such confusion clouded accountability.
Some authorities created by the last substantial local government
reorganisation in 1974 were still not wholly accepted by the communities
they served. In areas where the two tiers needed to work together - such as
planning - there was sometimes conflict and tension between the policies of
country and district councils.
'Changing the structure of local government will not in itself solve all the
problems. But in the main it is desirable that people can identify one
authority which secures services in their area. Having a single tier should
reduce bureaucracy and improve the co-ordination of services, increasing
quality and reducing costs.'
The consultation paper emphasises the government's determination to shift
the basis of local-authority activity from the direct provision of services
to the 'enabling' role of organising them. It says the government is
committed to contracting-out local authority services to the private sector
and voluntary organisations where that is justified by market-testing. 'The
aim should be to secure the best services at least cost.'
Such a changing role of local government, the paper says, significantly
altered the presumption that there was an ideal size of authority for the
efficient delivery of services. The government expects a range of sizes for
new authorities, determined by local circumstances, to emerge from the
proposed Local Government Commission review.
The consultation paper does not propose to change the structure of local
government in London and the metropolitan counties, where unitary
authorities have existed since 1985. Ministers are, however, looking for
improved ways of handling some joint services such as voluntary-sector and
arts funding in those conurbations.
Specific proposals to establish new unitary authorities will, the paper
says, have to be 'cost-effective'. The government plans to issue detailed
guidance on the basis for costings. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment
secretary, would reach decisions on proposals to change the system of local
government in a particular area after receiving the commission's
recommendations.
The complexity of existing electoral arrangements, which vary between local
authorities, may, the paper says, 'discourage people from taking an interest
in local government'. It finds a case for reconsidering electoral cycles and
numbers of councillors. Possible changes to local electoral arrangements
will be discussed in a consultation paper.
Views on yesterday's proposals are being sought by June 14. Separate papers
are being produced on the structure of local government in Scotland and
Wales.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: Airbus chief vows to fight off Gatt
challenge by US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission will use 'every legal weapon' at its disposal to
defend the interests of Airbus in its aircraft subsidies dispute with the
US, Mr Jean Pierson, the head of the European aircraft consortium, said
yesterday.
The long-standing trade dispute has entered an important new phase with the
US taking the issue before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt). The US claims the European consortium has received direct subsidies
totalling Dollars 25.9bn which have distorted trade in commercial aircraft.
But Mr Pierson, in an address to the Cranfield School of Management,
vigorously rebutted the US claims and called for a more balanced
redistribution of the world civil aircraft market.
'Airbus stands today as the only recourse against the monopoly of the civil
aerospace industry by US manufacturers,' Mr Pierson said. 'It must carefully
protect its hard-won positions in the strictest respect of international
agreements,' he added.
Mr Pierson claimed that the latest US attacks against Airbus coincided with
the European consortium's twin strategy of capturing a third of the world
airliner market by 2010 and developing a 700-seater aircraft to challenge
Boeing's monopoly of the jumbo airliner market.
He also suggested that the American attacks had intensified with the
approach of the first flight next October of the new long distance,
four-engined Airbus A340 aircraft which will increase competition for Boeing
and McDonnell Douglas in the long-haul airliner market.
Despite the aircraft industry's current difficulties, Mr Pierson expected
air traffic to show at least 5 per cent growth a year during the next 20
years, requiring the delivery of 12,300 new aircraft between now and 2010.
'This represents some Dollars 680bn worth of business of which Airbus firmly
intends to capture a third,' he said.
Responding to the latest US complaints, Mr Pierson said the European side
had recently made a number of proposals to redraft some of the contentious
articles of the Gatt civil aircraft agreement code. Europe, for example, had
agreed to limit to 45 per cent direct government support for research and
development of new Airbus programmes.
'From 100 per cent for the early Airbus programmes, launch aid has been
reduced to 60 per cent for our latest programme, the A330/A340 and to nil
for the A321,' Mr Pierson said. In return, Europe wanted total transparency
in the indirect support the US manufacturers receive from their government.
However, this proposal had been turned down by the US administration.
Mr Pierson claimed Boeing and McDonnell Douglas had received Dollars 23bn in
indirect supports from government agencies between 1978-87. The US, however,
disputes this.
Mr Pierson stressed that the European consortium's target was to finance
future programmes from internal funds. 'We have done so for the A321. As we
start delivering a complete range of aircraft from 1993 onwards, we will be
in a better position to compete with Boeing on an equal footing,' he said.

</HEADLINE>

   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is poised to become Romania's leading foreign investor, following the
visit of President Francois Mitterrand to Bucharest last week.
Mr Mitterrand, the first head of state to visit Romania since the revolution
in December 1989, was accompanied by six ministers, a dozen leading
businessmen, and bankers from the French Foreign Trade Bank, the Credit
Commercial de France and Lazard Freres.
France clearly intends to take advantage of the strong cultural links
between the two countries.
French companies have been reluctant until now to invest in Romania, largely
because they have been waiting for the law on foreign investment to be
enacted this month.
Most western investments in Romania have tended to focus on small-scale
activities. In the first quarter of 1991, Germany and Italy invested the
most, with Dollars 5.2m and Dollars 2.2m, respectively.
However, French companies anxious to gain a foothold in eastern Europe now
appear to be taking Romania as a serious potential trading partner.
This shift in emphasis was confirmed by the companies who travelled with Mr
Mitterrand. They included:
CIT Alcatel. It is hoping to gain 40 per cent of the market in telephone
systems. It will be competing with Siemens of Germany, which signed a
joint-venture agreement last autumn.
Groupe Sucres et Denrees. It signed a FFr100m (Pounds 9.93m) contract for
the rehabilitation of sugar beet production and the construction of three
sugar refineries.
Other large companies about to sign contracts include Societe Generale des
Eaux, which is planning to modernise Bucharest's poor water system and Elf
Aquitaine, which is looking into the country's petrol stations network.
Bouygues. It signed during the presidential visit a letter of intent for the
largest joint venture in the country so far, the construction of an
international trade centre.
The government-backed French international radio service, Radio France
International, has been broadcasting locally since January. A bilingual
station in Bucharest is planned for later in the spring.
The francophone international channel, TV5 Europe, started broadcasting in
Bucharest the day the French president arrived.
France's cultural budget in Romania already amounts to FFrs70m, by far the
largest among western countries.

MR Jibril Aminu, the Nigerian oil minister, is due in Washington tomorrow to
sign further financing arrangements for the Oso Nigerian gas condensate
project.
He will meet officials from Mobil Producing Nigeria, an arm of the US oil
company, which is a partner in the project, to sign loans worth Dollars
530m.
The loans are being made partly by the World Bank and its commercial arm,
the International Finance Corporation, as well as Japan's Export-Import bank
and the US Export-Import bank. Total financing for the project which is due
on stream in 1993, is put at Dollars 885m.
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation expects the project to produce
100,000 barrels of gas condensate a day in its first year of production.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: France's export credit claims rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH exporters made FFr11.4bn (Pounds 1.13bn) of net claims on
state-guaranteed contracts last year, equivalent to around 1 per cent of
France's total overseas sales, said Coface, the French export credit
guarantee agency.
The figure, the balance between overall repayments on state-guaranteed
exports handled by Coface and premium and other income, is a slight increase
on the FFr10.9bn of claims on state-covered exports paid out the previous
year.
It does not include claims expected from unpaid bills related to the Gulf
war, likely to be around of FFr5bn this year, forecast Coface officials.
However, Iraq was already among last year's worst payers, as were Egypt,
Morocco, Nigeria and Brazil, said officials.
Coface saw a 23 per cent rise in reimbursements it had to pay out on its own
account, rather than on the export credit guarantees it manages on behalf of
the Government. These rose from FFr290m to FFr345m, with the worst
performance coming from the recession-hit UK, plus Spain and Italy, said Mr
Henri Baquiast, chairman of Coface.
The group covers short term credits of less than three years and political
risks in the European Community, while it acts as an agency for the state
for most non-EC political risks and medium term credit guarantees.
Coface saw its operating profits fall from FFr133.8m in 1989 to FFr103.5m
last year, but exceptional gains lifted net earnings by FFr22.9m to
FFr158.4m.
Premium income on Coface's own activities rose by 9 per cent to FFr605m, but
Mr Baquiast did not expect the growth rate to improve significantly this
year, given the uncertain outlook for French industry's main export markets.
Coface was last year transformed from a government department into a
state-owned company, partly in anticipation of the European Commission's
increasingly tough policy on state support for exports.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: Dunkel acclaims free trade moves by
developing nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MCDERMOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Uruguay Round on global trade liberalisation may have stalled last
December, but 45 countries, mostly developing ones, have liberalised their
trade policies since the round was launched in 1986.
These moves are recorded in the annual report of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) presented to the Council yesterday by Mr Arthur
Dunkel, the director-general.
While pointing optimistically towards this development within Gatt, which
now has 101 members, Mr Dunkel records that, in volume terms, the growth of
merchandise trade slowed in 1990 to 5 per cent from 7 the previous year.
World output growth slipped from 4 to 3 per cent, but both figures were
close to the average for the 1983-1990 period of expansion.
In spite of the slowdown in volume growth in 1990, the value of merchandise
trade rose by 13 per cent to Dollars 3,500bn, boosted by the 7 per cent
depreciation in the average value of the dollar.
Preliminary estimates indicate that trade in commercial services - including
transport, tourism, telecommunications, insurance and banking  - increased
by 12 per cent to about Dollars 770bn.
Much of the standstill in the Uruguay Round talks has been caused by the
impasse between the European Community and the US over the need for deep
cuts in agricultural subsidies.
Looking ahead to 1991, Gatt says that 'there is, as yet, no evidence that
the slowdown in economic growth in the major industrial countries -
including a fall in output in France, the United States and the United
Kingdom in the fourth quarter of last year - has run its course'. A world
recession is unlikely, it says, but the timing of a broadly-based pick-up in
growth rates is also unclear.
The measures undertaken by the 45 countries include tariff reductions and
'bindings' (tariffs fixed in schedules to Gatt which can only be raised if
compensation is negotiated), the elimination of quotas, the abolition of
import licensing restrictions and the removal of other non-tariff barriers.
Looking ahead to the remainder of this year, Mr Dunkel emphasises 'the
importance of pushing ahead with the Uruguay Round negotiations'.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: Poland to give birth to Fiat's new baby -
FSM is to produce a brand new car under licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT is about to become the first western car maker to start production of a
new car range for western and eastern European markets exclusively from a
plant in eastern Europe.
The Italian company is to launch early next year a new mini car, the Fiat
Cinquecento (Fiat 500), which will be assembled under licence by FSM, one of
the two Polish state-owned car makers.
It is the first time that a model to be licensed by Fiat for production at a
foreign plant has been developed from scratch rather than derived from an
existing Italian model.
Fiat has invested L1,000bn (Pounds 453m) in developing the Cinquecento and
in plant and equipment to modernise the FSM assembly plant at Bielsko Biala,
Silesia.
Initially 160,000 cars a year will be produced. About 100,000 will be
exported to western Europe. Output could rise later to 220,000 cars a year.
Plant and equipment worth DM900m (Pounds 302m) has been supplied to FSM
under the Cinquecento development and production contract signed in 1987.
About half of this is being supplied by Italian machine tool and components
companies outside the Fiat group.
The currency needed by Poland to pay for the investment at FSM will be
generated by cars purchased by Fiat for sale through its dealer network in
western Europe.
As a result of this arrangement Fiat has taken on the entire commercial risk
for credit extended to Poland to buy plant and equipment both from the Fiat
group itself and from other suppliers.
Cover provided by SACE, the Italian state export credit insurance agency, is
limited to the risks of loss of revenue because of political events and
catastrophes, and actions by the Polish authorities which might limit FSM
production or block exports of finished cars.
The Cinquecento - named after Fiat's first baby car which pioneered the mini
car sector in the 1930s - will replace the existing Fiat 126, the smallest
car in the Fiat range.
The 126 was first produced in 1972 at the group's Cassino assembly plant in
Italy, but production was gradually transferred to the FSM plant at Bielsko
Biala from 1979. The Polish plant has been the sole production source for
the 126 since 1981.
Fiat is still seeking Polish government backing for a more far-reaching plan
to modernise and rationalise the entire Polish motor industry. It wants to
create a holding company combining FSM and FSO, the two state car makers, in
which Fiat would take the role of 'strategic investor', to build engine and
gearbox plants, and a licensing agreement to assemble the Fiat Tipo at the
FSO plant in Warsaw.
There is confusion over the future of the antiquated FSO operations,
however, which are centred on production of earlier Fiat designs under
licence.
Fiat's radical plan appeared to have gained the backing of Polish President
Lech Walesa on a recent visit to Italy, but FSO is also conducting competing
negotiations with General Motors for the assembly of Opel/Vauxhall cars in
Warsaw.
Mr Jack Smith, GM vice chairman responsible for international operations,
visited Warsaw last week for talks with FSO. The US car maker has completed
a feasibility study and is expected to begin negotiations with the
government and FSO within a month.
GM is considering investing Dollars 100m to establish an assembly operation
for 30-50,000 cars a year (on two or three shifts) at part of the existing
FSO facility.

FT  24 APR 91 / Managers shun passport offer

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S offer of up to 50,000 passports to key Hong Kong people has been
poorly received by managers and administrators, the individuals the package
was designed to attract.
Just fewer than 15,000 passports have been allocated for managers and
administrators, the largest job category in the package. The quota has been
under-subscribed by about 10 per cent, according to Mr Donald Tsang,
director of administration.
The package was introduced last year under the British Nationality Act. It
was one of a series of measures designed to restore confidence in Hong Kong,
severely shocked by the crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in
Peking in June 1989.
All the other job categories have been over-subscribed, some heavily. The
government received 1,000 applications from legal professionals by the time
the offer closed at the end of February against a quota for this category of
only 185.
Mr Tsang said the response by private sector managers and administrators was
not surprising because they were the only people who had to disclose details
about income.
Almost 400 passports were set aside within the managers and administrators
category for civil servants. Competition for these passports was fierce,
according to Mr Tsang.
The government received just over 63,800 applications for the first tranche
of 38,900 passports on offer for people in the general occupations and
disciplined services. A further 1,800 people, including entrepreneurs and
sensitive service personnel, have been invited to apply by the Governor.
The response was much poorer than expected. China's opposition to the
scheme, a feeling in Hong Kong the scheme was elitist and a dislike of the
UK were all blamed for the low level of interest.
'I only want a British passport so I can go and live in Paris after 1992,'
says a 28-year-old Hong Kong Chinese journalist who did apply.
Mr Tsang said any passports left over from the managers and administrators
category can be carried forward and given out in the second tranche when a
further 6,750 passports are on offer. Applications for the second tranche
will run from 1994 to June 1997, when Hong Kong is handed back to China.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has offered to take in hundreds of Kuwaiti university students next
year as part of a package of technical and material help designed to get the
emirate's education system back on its feet.
A delegation of British educationalists, led by the British Council, made
the offer this week after the Kuwait government indicated it is placing the
highest priority on opening its schools and universities in August and
September.
Kuwait says it expects its 600 schools to be refurbished and ready by
August, but that damage to vital teaching equipment in universities and
other higher education institutions would hinder the return of some of the
emirate's 15,000 university students.
Mr Stuart Sutherland, the vice-chairman of London University, said he had
accordingly offered places to hundreds of Kuwaiti students, whose fees would
be payed by the Kuwait government, on a temporary basis. 'We could reopen a
small campus in London next year which would take 400-500 students,' he
said. 'And I"m sure other British polytechnics and universities could offer
some space.'
The delegation, led by Mr Timothy Raison, vice-chairman of the British
Council, also included Ove Arup, the architects, and Laing Consultants, who
discussed supplying Kuwait with everything from books to laboratory
equipment. Mr Raison said no firm contracts had been offered, but added:
'The government seems very willing to commit themselves quickly to
re-equipping.'
Mr Raison also said the Kuwaiti authorities expressed interest in setting up
creches, in order that Kuwaiti women could be encouraged to take up teaching
posts. This is a further indication that the government is determined to
replace Palestinians, who traditionally made up the core of Kuwait's
teaching staff, in public service posts.

ISRAEL'S central bank yesterday warned that the country could face
unprecedented emigration and unemployment approaching 20 per cent of the
workforce if the government did not quickly enact economic reforms to cope
with a wave of immigration by Soviet Jews.
Prof Michael Bruno, governor of the Bank of Israel, also linked the issue to
present efforts by the US to mediate a Middle East peace settlement. He said
Israel risked losing vital US assistance for raising the huge funds the
country will require to finance immigration if the peace process failed.
'US readiness to help finance (immigrant absorption) has a significant
importance to our ability to raise money in the international financial
marketplace and a greater expert than myself would tell you what the
conditions are under which the US will be ready to invest here,' said Prof
Bruno, who is due to leave his post shortly.
A 60-page bank plan for absorption of Soviet immigrants, expected to total
more than 400,000 by the end of this year, called for a series of radical
reforms as well as short-term measures to boost employment and improve
infrastructure. It said that as many as 200,000 immigrants and additional
native Israelis might leave the country, and unemployment could almost
double within two years if such steps were not taken.
It called for cuts in taxation on business and employment, the scrapping of
labour market rigidities, greater capital market freedoms, and a more
liberal foreign trade regime. Mr Bruno complained that a government plan
last September to enact a number of these prescriptions had never been
carried out.
'Non-implementation of the policies would prevent the possibility of fully
enjoying the fruits of the immigration. The pace of productive growth would
be too slow, unemployment would grow to dangerous dimensions, followed by
growing emigration,' the bank's plan said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LUXEMBOURG yesterday proposed that the European Community establish a
fully-fledged central bank during the transition to monetary union, but
delay its creation until 1996.
The plan was tabled by the EC's current president at the regular fortnightly
meeting of special negotiators on economic and monetary union (Emu). It is
designed to strike a balance between the insistence of France and several
other states that the European central bank be set up in 1994, the planned
start of the transition to Emu, and the desire of Germany to delay such a
bank until the late-1990s target date for a single currency.
Ever since last October's Rome summit which called for a new monetary
institution in 1994, there has been a war of words between Paris and Bonn on
how to interpret that summit's communique, with Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president, intervening from time to time to accuse Germany of
backsliding.
The Luxembourg plan calls for a three phase move towards a fully-operational
European central bank. Six months after an Emu treaty comes into force,
perhaps 1993 or 1994 depending on the speed of ratification by national
parliaments, the present 'committee' of EC central bank governors would be
transformed into a 'council'. Its role would be to improve co-ordination of
national monetary policies, whose implementation would still be in national
hands.
By 1996, or earlier if governments agreed unanimously, the European system
of central banks would be set up, to take over the running of the European
monetary system and act as a clearing house for the Ecu.
Finally, from the date when EC governments had taken the final decision to
merge their currencies, the European central bank could expand its role to
hold and manage foreign exchange reserves. It could also start to make
policy recommendations to national central banks, and be empowered to make
those recommendations public if necessary.

<TEXT>
THE central banks of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary
yesterday pledged support for a new banking payments system for trade among
east European nations.
The system would use as a common currency the Ecu, the basket of the main
west European currencies. It has been proposed by the Ecu Banking
Association, a group of west European banks, and would be based on an
existing Ecu bank-payments operation in Switzerland.
Officials from the central banks of the four countries were at a meeting in
Turin to discuss the concept. Three west European banks - Deutsche Bank of
Germany, Credit Lyonnais of France and San Paolo Bank of Italy - have said
they will help the initiative.
The east European nations are to discuss the system further over the next
few months. Assuming details such as legal and technical issues and problems
over lines of credit can be sorted out, the venture is likely to be
controlled by a group of banks from eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
THE Soviet land reform in east Germany between 1945 and 1949, involving the
expropriation and redistribution of nearly one-third of the former communist
state's land, cannot be reversed, according to the German constitutional
court in Karlsruhe.
The Bonn government, under pressure from Moscow and from the short-lived
democratic government in east Berlin, had already accepted the Soviet land
reform in last year's unity treaty, but 14 individuals lodged formal
complaints that such acceptance was unconstitutional.
Yesterday's ruling, that the Bonn government was justified in accepting the
land reform, affects 3m hectares of land. The court advised that the
government should pay compensation to the former owners.
Ministers in Bonn welcomed the decision and said that it removed an
uncertainty that had held up new investment in many rural areas. Property
expropriated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945 or by the East German
government after 1949 is, with some qualifications, still being returned to
former owners.
The uncertainty created by this slow and difficult process is still regarded
as one of the biggest obstacles to new investment in east Germany.
In the second half of 1990 east Germany had a GNP of DM105.3bn (Pounds
35.2bn) about 8.3 per cent of west Germany's GNP over the same period, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said. Average gross monthly income in
east Germany was DM1,357, 37 per cent of the west German level.

MR Vladimir Meciar, prime minister of the Slovak Republic, was ousted by

Slovakia faced the prospect of intensified political conflict after Mr
Meciar threatened to march on the government in Bratislava. Nearly 1,000 of
his supporters gathered outside parliament last night demanding his
reinstatement.
The presidium of parliament also forced out of government all but one of the
members of Mr Meciar's Public Against Violence (PAV) movement which formed a
coalition with Mr Carnogursky's Christian Democrats. Several had supported
Mr Meciar's new breakaway nationalist group, PAV-Platform for a Democratic
Slovakia. He won more than 80 per cent support in recent opinion polls in
Slovakia.
Mr Meciar opposed Prague's free market economic reforms because the Slovak
economy stands to lose most jobs.
Mr Carnogursky has been ambivalent about Slovak independence. He favours a
treaty with Prague on continuing the federation. President Vaclav Havel
rejects this.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SOFIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA will have a law on privatisation and property rights in place by
the autumn as part of the coalition government's timetable for implementing
a second package of reforms aimed at creating a market economy, Mr Dimiter
Popov, the prime minister, said yesterday.
The measures, which are expected to allow Bulgarians to own and buy
property, are also designed to open up the country to foreign investment.
Little in the way of foreign investment has flowed into Bulgaria in recent
months, largely because the current legislation is either too vague on
taxes, or too restrictive on the repatriation of profits.
Moreover, investors have shied away from Bulgaria because until recently the
country was too unstable; western commercial bank creditors have not yet
agreed to reschedule the Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5bn) debt owed to the London
Club.
However, Mr Popov, who was elected prime minister last December following
the resignation of the socialist government, stressed Bulgaria's new
stability. 'It is definitely stable. The parliament is working hard to draft
and pass new legislation. The political climate is much better,' he said.
Since January, when a coalition government consisting of the Union of
Democratic Forces (UDF), a loose grouping of 19 political groupings, and the
Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), was set up, Bulgaria has embarked on a
tight monetary policy.
In February, prices were increased four-fold, a squeeze on credit and
consumer spending has been successfully implemented, and the first phase of
land reform - the return of a maximum of 30 hectares to its original owners
before 1946 - has been passed.
At the same time, industrial production has plummeted by 20 per cent because
of the collapse of the Soviet market and a moratorium on western credits.
But the success of these reforms has been overshadowed by bitter infighting
between the UDF and the BSP about who should control the political and
economic agenda.
Mr Popov, 63, politically independent, and a lawyer by profession, denies
that purges in the administration have taken place. 'We will not start any
revenge. No such thing has taken place in Bulgaria. Those with talent will
be promoted, irrespective of their political background. But we will not
accept those who abused their position in the former regime.'
The former regime, led by Mr Todor Zhivkov, who is now standing trial for
corruption charges, was toppled from power in a bloodless palace coup in
November, 1989. The BSP (former communist party) won a comfortable majority
in last June's free elections.
However, BSP sympathisers and UDF officials admit that the UDF leadership
remains determined to purge former communists. Mr Popov says his aim to to
create 'a new civil service based on competence and competition.'

<TEXT>
THE European Commission has told the French government to furnish detailed
proof that it is not using the flagships of its public sector to funnel
illegal state aid to smaller companies in industrially declining regions.
This latest row over state aid between Brussels and Paris comes shortly
after the Commission announced it would examine French plans to provide over
Dollars 1bn in fresh capital to two big state-owned companies, Bull, the
computer manufacturer, and Thomson, the defence and electronics group.
Thomson is one of six state-owned companies named in the Commission's
letter, along with Electricite de France, Elf Aquitaine, Pechiney, Rhone
Poulenc, and Enterprise Miniere et Chimique.
The Commission has given Paris two months to provide details of the funding
which would enable it to compare it with the activities of three private
groups, BSN, CGE and Saint-Gobain, which France maintains behave
identically. 'As major local employers (they are) merely assuming
responsibility for the survival of part of the economic fabric,' the French
authorities wrote to the Commission last April.
Brussels says the subsidised loans, provision of services, and, in some
cases, acquisition of holdings by the six state companies may constitute a
distortion of competition.
It has reminded the French government that if this proves to be the case, it
will have to recover the aid. Last year the Commission made Renault, the
state-controlled car manufacturer, repay more than Dollars 1bn in assistance
which Brussels judged illegal.

FT  24 APR 91 / Swedes expect recession to end next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish recession, one of west Europe's worst, should end gradually next
year under the influence of the government's anti-inflation strategy and an
international upturn. This was forecast in yesterday's supplementary budget.
The government's medium-term outlook suggests Sweden will move into line
with average western European economic performance by the mid-1990s. Mr
Allan Larsson, finance minister, told employers yesterday the economy had
already begun to recover
In his budget statement, he said inflation, now running at 9.6 per cent
annually, would ease considerably this year; he projected 3 per cent for
1992.
There would be a negative growth rate this year of -0.2 per cent but the
following year should see the economy grow by 1 per cent, with annual growth
of more than 2 per cent thereafter until 1995.
The government takes an optimistic view of what will happen to pay
increases, expecting a marked fall to 5 per cent this year, after an average
10.3 per cent in 1990, and just over 3 per cent in 1992 as a result of a
two-year national agreement now accepted by all public sector workers and 55
per cent of private sector manual workers.
Mr Larsson said the government would have to act if those opposing restraint
secured higher pay than the rest because it would lead to the collapse of
the whole pay stabilisation deal and wreck the government's strategy.
He said there would be a SKr18.5bn (Pounds 1.75bn) budget deficit this year,
although the percentage of public spending as a proportion of gross domestic
product was down to 62 per cent compared with 67 per cent 10 years ago.
The government is aiming to cut its own budget by SKr2bn or 10 per cent over
the next three years; public sector consumption is set to rise at an annual
rate of 0.4 per cent.
Registered unemployment will increase, but the government expects the rate
to stay under 3 per cent. Independent forecasters believe it will climb to
4-5 per cent by the end of next year.

FT  24 APR 91 / Cheap loans row taxes Spanish Socialists
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR-LONG low key guerrilla war by Spain's governing Socialist party
against the conservative finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, is escalating
sharply over the latter's dismissal of a party proposal to use Spanish banks
to finance cheap mortgages for 400,000 people in the next four years.
The Socialist party, which faces testing municipal elections on May 26,
plans to use low home financing as its main election plank.
However, when it was first mooted last week that Spanish banks might be
forced to set aside funds to enable homebuyers to take mortgages at 8 per
cent, Mr Solchaga, with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez' tacit support,
rapidly and pronounced it unworkable.
The banks, he said, could not be asked to make unprofitable loans. Normal
mortgages cost more than 18 per cent in Spain.
Party officials immediately hit back accusing the finance minister of trying
to hijack its election programme.
Two days later Mr Gonzalez steered a cabinet meeting into announcing that
finding cheap homes for people was a good idea but that some other way would
have to be found to do it. What he meant was that taxpayers would have to
come up with the money.
On Monday, for some reason, Mr Solchaga repeated, on radio, his view that
the party's original plan was quite unworkable.
The party immediately accused him of being blinded 'by his own fuzzy
vision'. He promptly retorted that 'if they are going to accuse me of fuzzy
vision they should accuse (Mr Gonzalez) the same way'.
Mr Gonzalez is trying hard not to take sides, though he probably agrees with
his finance minister.
Mr Solchaga's toxic relations with party administrators go back more than a
year, when he began to criticise openly the control over the party held by
Mr Alfonso Guerra, the left-wing former deputy prime minister. Mr Guerra
left the government in January in the wake of a family financial scandal,
but he has remained deputy party leader.
Mr Gonzalez has tried to declare his government's independence from the
party but it is clear he cannot totally divorce himself from grassroots or
even bureaucratic party opinion.
At the moment, the row may actually be working to the Socialists' benefit,
as cheap housing has become the dominant issue in the local elections. But
the constant sniping between finance minister and party is beginning to
irritate the prime minister seriously.

THE HEAD of the Dutch central bank, Mr Wim Duisenberg, yesterday called for
wage restraint in industry and for greater financial discipline by the
country's centre-left government.
Real labour costs, relatively stable throughout the 1980s, threatened to
rise by up to 2.5 per cent a year between now and 1994, causing a severe
slowdown in the number of new jobs and pushing up inflation, he said.
The rise in wages also had a direct impact on state finances because of the
government's promise in 1989 to raise social-security benefits in line with
private sector salary increases.
Mr Duisenberg, presenting the bank's 1990 annual report, said the government
had to do more to control its budget deficit without resorting to large
increases in the burden of taxation and social security contributions.
However, he 'feared the worst' because the financing deficit so far this
year had already exceeded government targets, complicating efforts to cut
the deficit to 3.25 per cent of national income by 1994.
'The targets for 1994 will never be realised if we do not manage to extract
ourselves from the quicksand of 1991,' he said.

FT  24 APR 91 / French minister heads into education minefield: Everyone
agrees the system needs reforming, but no one agrees how
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Michel Rocard's government was appointed three years ago, it made
modernisation of the education system its top domestic priority. Mr Lionel
Jospin, a leading light in the Socialist party, was give the job of
education minister, and the number two spot in the cabinet, to symbolise
this priority.
Most people greeted the government's declaration of commitment with a
mixture of respect and scepticism. For while everybody agrees that French
education needs reforming, everybody also knows that education is a daunting
political minefield; recent French history is littered with education
ministers who attempted to tamper with the entrenched traditions of the
education system, and who paid dearly for their temerity.
It now begins to look, however, as if Mr Jospin really does intend to try to
reform the hydra-headed monster. He has just tabled proposals which go to
the heart of the system, because they are aimed at humanising the gruelling
baccalaureat school-leaving examination.
These reforms are designed to simplify the syllabuses of the different
baccalaureats, to shorten and above all to alleviate the school working
week, and to modernise teaching methods.
Whether the package will make any headway is still uncertain: the main
parents' association has voiced its approval, but the main secondary school
teachers' union has condemned it outright.
The complaint most frequently levelled against the traditional baccalaureat
is that it is an elitist, intellectual examination, ill-adapted for mass
education.
Twenty years ago, 40 per cent of 17-year-olds were still at school; today
the figure is over 70 per cent. Twenty years ago, 25 per cent of the
school-leaving generation were aiming for the 'bac'; today the figure is 55
per cent; by the end of the century the government aims to raise the
proportion to 80 per cent.
The traditional baccalaureat continues to be the yardstick of attainment and
the principal door for future advancement, and it continues to be the main
target for a growing number of French school students.
And yet the expansion in numbers has left it largely unchanged either in
content or in method: it remains a traditional intellectual examination,
taught with traditional class-room methods, and in theory (but only in
theory) it is taught by traditional French intellectuals.
France is now probably the only country where philosophy is still one of the
obligatory subjects in the main school-leaving examination.
The most revolutionary element in the Jospin package is the proposal that
the lycees should set aside three hours a week for informal 'modules', small
class-groups devoted either to catch-up work for slow students, or to the
acquisition of learning and research techniques for the fast.
This is an iconoclastic innovation because, while the work carried on in
these modules would be part of the core curriculum, it would not be marked.
Two of the most notorious weaknesses of the French education system are that
it has the shortest school year in Europe, but the longest school week. For
some technical baccalaureats the school week now lasts 40 hours, plus
several hours' home-work every night. Mr Jospin is now proposing a maximum
of 35 hours.
The third component of the Jospin reforms is a simplification of the
baccalaureat syllabuses, so as to get away from the current scourge of
hyper-specialisation.
At present there are eight different subject groups for the general
baccalaureat, and 17 for the technological bac; both would be simplified
into three broad streams. In the general bac, the choice would be letters,
social science, and science, though the curriculum would continue to include
subjects outside the main specialisation.
The main stumbling block for all previous reform efforts has been the
resistance of the many teaching unions, and this one is not likely to be an
exception.
Mr Jospin has carefully kept away from any detailed proposals on the content
of the baccalaureats; this is the most treacherous ground because it affects
the vested interests of teachers of philosophy, geography, maths, etc. But
if Mr Jospin's modest reform is to be implemented, it may require a
revolution in the attitudes and methods of France's teachers.
It looks as if Mr Jospin really does intend to try to reform the
hydra-headed monster. He has just tabled proposals which go to the heart of
the system, because they are aimed at humanising the gruelling baccalaureat
school-leaving examination.

airliner

<TEXT>
FOKKER, the Dutch aerospace group, aims to complete a feasibility study on
developing a new 130-seat airliner by the end of 1991.
The Dutch company is one of several European aircraft manufacturers to have
announced its interest in entering the market for 130-seat aircraft. 'Four
players in that market segment are too many, but Fokker believes that it
must be one of those four,' Mr Marten Kuilman, the chairman, said at the
annual report presentation.
If Fokker's plans proceed as expected, its proposed 130-seater aircraft
would be based largely on its 100-seater Fokker 100. Fokker is also
considering the development of an 80-seat aircraft which would be a
derivative of its former F28.
In 1990, Fokker's net profit nearly doubled to Fl 83.4m (Dollars 42.1m) from
Fl 42.4m in 1989. The sharp rise was due mainly to lower financing charges,
higher contributions from associated companies, and book profits from
divestments.
Despite the steep increase, the company announced in March that it was
postponing the resumption of dividend payments. It attributed the delay
partly to the sacrifices being asked of its workforce, where jobs are being
cut to reduce costs and counter the weakness of the dollar.
Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, the group's finance director, said the recent strong
rise in the dollar had brought it back to a more 'comfortable' level for
Fokker.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S Catholic bishops have attacked the 'unjust' economic policies of
President Carlos Menem, blaming them for creating an ever-wider gap between
rich and poor.
In a strongly worded note issued over the weekend, the bishop's also
condemned widespread corruption which 'is destroying us as a people and as a
society.'
The note, issued at the end of the annual bishops' conference, is the second
time in as many months that the powerful Catholic church has taken issue
with Mr Menem. Last month they warned that 'generalised corruption' was
undermining support for the government.
The traditionalist hierarchy's latest broadside is significant because in
the past it firmly supported conservative, often military, governments. Mr
Menem, although nominally a Peronist, has adopted pro-business and free
market policies.

FT  23 APR 91 / Soviet debt to Finland falls as trade drops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ACCORDING to figures released by the Bank of Finland, the total Soviet debt
to Finland reached around FM5.6bn, (Dollars 1.4bn) at the end of last March,
dropping from some FM6.5bn at the end of 1990.
The drop in the debt was mainly attributable to credits and deposits
received by Finnish commercial banks from the USSR.
Of the total FM5.6bn debt owed by the Soviets to Finland, FM2.2bn was made
up of over five-year-long clearing credits, FM1.2bn in five to seven-year
hard-cash credits and FM1bn in one-year hard-cash credits given by Finnish
banks.
Another FM400m is in a special clearing account with the remaining FM800m
being hard-cash payments in arrears.
Apart from these receivables, the balance of payments in the clearing
account is at present Dollars 100m in favour of the Soviets.
This money will be used to pay back the debt owed by Moscow to Finnish
companies.
Finland is facing a severe recession which has also been exacerbated by the
sharp plunge in trade with the USSR, after the Finnish-Soviet clearing
system switched to hard currency at the beginning of 1991.
Mr Mauno Koivisto, the Finnish president told Mr Valentin Pavlov, Soviet
Prime Minister, this week in London that he hoped both countries could
switch back to trade based on barter.
Given the economic and political instability in the USSR, observers are
sceptical of such a change.
Meanwhile, Finnair, the state-owned airline, and the Soviet airline,
Aeroflot, have signed an agreement which is aimed at studying the prospects
of forming a joint venture to offer air services between Leningrad and the
rest of Europe.
With its home base in Leningrad, the joint venture airline would use a part
of Finnair's DC-9 fleet and use Finnish airlines maintenance and training
facilities in Helsinki.

FT  23 APR 91 / Swedish parties attacked on policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S main opposition parties - the Moderates and the Liberals - were
accused yesterday of wanting to introduce Thatcherism into the country if
they form a government after the next general election.
'They want to put Mrs Thatcher's discarded coat over Mother Sweden,' said Mr
Allan Larsson, finance minister of the ruling Social Democrats, in an attack
on their joint economic programme revealed at the weekend which is designed
to transform Sweden into a more market-oriented economy.
'What they want to do is nothing more than to introduce the policies that
were tried out in Britain during the 1980s and which led to very high
unemployment and increased social division,' he added.
Today Mr Larsson will introduce Sweden's supplementary budget for 1991 which
will indicate the Social Democratic alternative to the Moderate-Liberal
economic programme.
The two main opposition parties have indicated they intend to fight the
forthcoming general election campaign on a common economic strategy.
It contains promises for a direct cut in Sweden's value added tax from 25
per cent to between 18-20 per cent as part of a staged reduction in public
spending and tax pressure for adjustment to future European Community
membership.
The parties also pledge to cut the proportion of Sweden's gross national
product of 60 per cent that goes to the public sector, reform the sickness
insurance system to deal with the scandal of high absenteeism from work and
privatise the state industry sector.
They will also abolish monopolies, encourage saving and share ownership, and
strengthen market forces in the labour market as well as in the financial
system and in industry.
Both Mr Carl Bildt, the Moderate leader and Mr Bengt Westerberg, leader of
the Liberals said their programme would not be changed to satisfy any other
possible coalition partners in a future non-Socialist government.
The Christian Democrats who are expected to enter Parliament for the first
time will back the far-reaching economic manifesto. But Mr Olof Johansson,
Centre party leader, said he could not agree with much of it and doubted
whether the Centre would support such a market strategy.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (14):
Quest for the right balance - Patrick Blum looks at the controversial
privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW issues have been quite as controversial as the government's
privatisation programme in spite of a broad consensus in favour of selling
companies nationalised in the mid-70s.
Though there has been some opposition to the privatisations from groups of
former owners who are mostly seeking better compensation, and, on the left,
from those who want to preserve a large state sector, in practice the
government has had a free hand.
This has allowed it to establish what must be the largest privatisation
programme in Europe outside the former communist countries.
Plans are to sell dozens of leading companies including banks, insurance
companies, manufacturers of a wide range of products from cement to beer,
chemicals to pulp and paper, steel and oil distribution companies, leading
utilities including telecommunications, the tobacco monopoly, the state
airline, shipping and bus companies, to the last state-owned newspaper.
The scale of the programme has not really been at issue, rather criticism
has focused on the way it has been undertaken. The government has been
accused of selling companies on the cheap to foreigners, of inflating share
prices to maximise revenues, of distorting the market by imposing rigid
limits on the purchase of privatised shares by the same foreigners, of
failing to protect adequately Portuguese interests, of going about it in a
half-hearted way, and of failing to use privatisations as a means of
restructuring the economy.
It is an illustration of the difficulty of the task that in one way or
another all of these conflicting criticisms can be held to be partially
true. Local business groups have been most vocal in attacking the government
for failing to defend Portuguese interests.
They argue that the method of selling companies on the stock market combined
with the high price set for privatised shares effectively rules out a
greater role by Portuguese investors who do not have the financial clout of
large foreign groups.
The problem is that there are too few large Portuguese groups able to absorb
the volume of privatisations planned even if prices were lower. One
suggestion is that potential Portuguese investors should be given
preferential credit terms to help them buy into companies.
To counter the criticism that it is selling off the family silver to
foreigners, the government has imposed rigid limits on the amount of
privatised shares foreigners can buy, but this has proved ineffective.
Foreign companies have indirectly through local alliances to win key if not
majority stakes in most of the companies privatised so far.
What the limits have done is to distort the process, make it less
transparent, and push prices up further.
Most critics believe the government's main objective has been to maximise
revenues from the sales, which last year alone brought it revenues of more
than Es140bn (Dollars 970m) in six operations.
That figure is likely to look small if this year's programme which includes
selling several banks and some leading companies is fully carried out,
though this appears less certain now. The programme has unfolded in fits and
starts, and has faced repeated delays. These have been exacerbated by the
Gulf war, and several privatisations due in the first quarter of the year
have yet to take place.
A general election is due by October at the latest and this will
increasingly occupy the minds of ministers.
Perhaps the most serious charge is that not enough thought has been given to
using the privatisation process to restructure important parts of the
economy.
The government's answer is that by privatising public companies it is doing
precisely that and strengthening the market economy.
Critics are not convinced  - 'privatisations in the financial sector, for
example, are decided piecemeal,' says a leading economist.
'There is no overall strategy, but what we need is an active restructuring
to prepare quickly the economy for the single (European) market.
'The government should intervene selectively to help the formation of
Portuguese groups, otherwise we'll miss a unique opportunity.'

FT  23 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 2,500 level lost in slow trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK STOCKS suffered another sharp reversal yesterday, falling nearly 30
points to close below the FT-SE 2,500 mark as investor optimism melted away
on both sides of the Atlantic. Selling pressure remained fairly modest but
buyers continued to avoid UK equities, believing that further cuts in UK
interest rates may be delayed and that the domestic economy remains
depressed.
The Footsie Index ended 29.3 down at 2,490.8, the low of the day and the
first close below 2,500 since the beginning of the month. Concern over
interest rates and economic uncertainties mirrored those in New York.
London, already depressed by the fall of almost 34 Dow points in New York on
Friday, fell sharply in late dealings yesterday as Wall Street recorded a
loss of a further 32 Dow points early in the new session. Having failed to
show much enthusiasm last week for Wall Street's successful, albeit brief,
move above Dow 3,000, the UK market now seems to be reacting quickly to the
fall in the US market.
As often when the underlying equity market lacks certainty, share prices
reacted to movements in the June futures contract on the FT-SE Index. In
late trading the futures contract turned down and led the underlying equity
market below the 2,500 mark.
However, equity trading volumes were moderate in London yesterday, with Seaq
recorded turnover at 403m shares, compared with 465.8m on Friday and as much
as 700m shares daily during last month's bullish period. Lower volume is
disturbing for the securities industry; London Stock Exchange data shows
that retail business fell to the Pounds 700m to Pounds 800m daily range last
week, after running well above Pounds 1bn daily in March.
The latest Confederation of British Industry/Financial Times survey of
distributive trades did little to change views on the underlying
sluggishness of consumer business - an unexpected rise in high street sales
appeared to reflect special factors, chiefly the sharp increase in value
added tax announced in the UK Budget in mid-March.
Today brings the UK trade figures for last month, which equity market
analysts predict will show little change from the Pounds 0.7bn monthly
deficit recorded in February.
Wall Street's influence brought widespread falls in the blue chip
internationals, where the dollar's strength proved no help to such US
currency earners as BAT Industries and the pharmaceutical stocks. ICI, with
first-quarter trading figures due this week, fell smartly. With crude oil
prices still unsettled and many analysts bearish, BP and the other leading
oil producer shares could make little headway in yesterday's stock market.
The retail group took the CBI/FT survey fairly well, and although there was
little buying across the broad range of the sector, there were a few firm
spots. Ratners, the jewellery chain, brushed off disappointing results as
investors continued to show faith that there will be a recovery in the
economy, and thus in consumer confidence, by the end of the year.
Kingfisher, the high street stores group, managed one of the firm
performances of the session.
Mr Neil Mackinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi, warned that the next shock
for London and other global equity markets could come on Friday, when the
first-quarter GNP data for the US economy are published. 'So far there is
little evidence to support the official view of an early recovery in the
(US) economy,' said Mr Mackinnon.

FT  23 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Royals hit by rights talk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUSTAINED weakness in Royal Insurance, the composite insurer, was
accompanied by vague market suggestions that the group might be considering
a rights issue. A cash call from Royals has been talked about for some time
by a number of insurance specialists. Another suggestion is that analysts
are preparing to downgrade their earnings and dividend forecasts for the
company.
Some dealers, however, attributed the sharp fall in the shares, which
settled 18 lower at 447p, to the fact that they had held up well against the
rest of the sector during the first quarter.
There are suggestions that Royals' first-quarter results, due next month,
could show a loss in excess of Pounds 60m. Analysts had been hoping that
Royals might break even in the current year, but now some of them are
looking for a full year loss of something in the order of Pounds 50m.
Gestetner weakens
Downgradings from competing broking houses put shares of Gestetner, the
distributor of office equipment and photographic products, under pressure.
Three analysts at least revised estimates of current year profits, the
lowest of which until yesterday had been Smith New Court's Pounds 62m.
James Capel was said to have reduced its figure to Pounds 58m but more
savage cuts came from BZW, and from another house which preferred to remain
anonymous. Citing extremely poor trading throughout February and March,
which will obviously affect group first-half profits, BZW dropped its
estimate to only Pounds 50m for the full year. An even lower figure of
Pounds 47m was said to have been forecast by another house.
BZW retained its longer term view of being overweight in the stock but sees
short-term downside. Gestetner closed 20 weaker at 213p.
Hammerson good
The volatile property stock Hammerson was the best performer of the day
among FT-SE 100 constituents in the wake of results announced last week.
County NatWest issued a buy note on the stock yesterday. It highlighted the
company's cautious management policy and exposure to the dollar as reasons
to buy. 'The worst is certainly over, certainly in terms of sentiment.' said
County.
The company also made a presentation to its institutional shareholders at
the offices of its broker BZW. More than 60 fund management staff attended.
Hammerson was 20 better at one point and the shares eventually closed at
630p for a gain of 15 on the day. Volume was a typical 350,000.
Ratners shines
Ratners, the jewellery retail chain, shrugged off disappointing final
results as investors looked forward to the prospect of a recovery in
consumer spending by the year-end. The shares closed 8 higher at 178p on
turnover of 3m.
With nearly half of Ratners' UK profits made in the Christmas period, the
market took heart from the confident statement by Mr Gerald Ratner, the
chairman, who said he was hopeful for significantly better trading
conditions during that important period.
Full year profits fell 8 per cent to Pounds 112m, slightly below market
estimates. As a result, analysts lowered their current forecasts to around
Pounds 127m to Pounds 130m from Pounds 130m to Pounds 135m.
It was the turn of cautious chemicals analysts to voice opinions on ICI and
its first-quarter figures due on Thursday. The shares fell 21 to 1080p.
Inchcape slipped 8 to 332p as the company reshuffled its board.
Volume in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi climbed to 25m, but traders explained that more
than 1 1/2 bn Saatchi shares are in issue now that the rights offer is
complete. As a result, it is one of the most liquid stocks in the market and
this kind of trading volume is to be expected. The share price ended
unchanged at 19 3/4 p.
Weekend reports that ADT might sell its stake in Christies International
left the latter 8 off at 218p. Volatile Brent Walker slid 8 to 66p in the
wake of press comment on the company.
The wider market reaction combined with a downgrading by Lehman Brothers,
the securities house, pushed Trafalgar House down 9 to 245p in heavier
trading volume of 2.7m shares.
Official confirmation of weekend reports that Guinness Mahon, the UK
merchant bank, will announce a substantial interim loss later this week
prompted a near 20 per cent drop in the shares. They closed a net 8 lower at
42p.
Mr Geoffrey Bell, Guinness Mahon's chairman, said the results would include
a provision of Pounds 30m for bad loans, giving the bank an after tax loss
of Pounds 35m. There will be no dividend, Mr Bell added.
Bank of Yokohama, Japan's leading regional bank, gained control of Guinness
Mahon in 1989, paying 146p a share, and it holds a 65 per cent stake. Mr
Robert Maxwell has a 9 per cent holding.
Oil shares were resilient, closing little changed on balance in spite of the
steep falls in equities on both sides of the Atlantic. They were bolstered,
dealers said, by the latest rise in crude oil prices, currently around the
Dollars 20 a barrel mark, and the strength of the dollar. 'With oil priced
in dollars the majors are 100 per cent exposed to the currency,' said one
specialist.
There were hints that Elf's advisers had priced Elf's 25 per cent holding in
Enterprise Oil prior to its imminent placing, but specialists said it was
more likely that Elf would hold out for a price in the region of 600p before
it would sell. Enterprise was easier at 555p.
Cadbury Schweppes fell 11 to 395p on a revival of speculation about a
possible rights issue. Asda was off 1 1/2 at 119 1/2 p as the market waited
for the company's meeting with brokers, to be held later this week. The
shares have been depressed on speculation that analysts' forecasts may be
reduced.
Budgens put on 2 to 47p after reports that some shareholders are seeking
senior management changes.
Relief that the annual profits shortfall over the previous year was not
worse boosted issues of Polymark International, the laundry equipment
distributor. The ordinary shares advanced 8 to 28p and the preferred 'A' 17
to 115p.
Renewed speculative interest was held responsible for further strength in
USM-listed ML Laboratories, which finished 18 higher at 455p.
There were further setbacks in a water sector still suffering from last
week's news that trading in the Water Package is to cease from July 12.
Dealers maintained that this will result in sustained selling of the
Package, with funds unwilling to be left with thinly traded components of
each package unit.
Much of the recent selling has come from overseas investors, it was said,
with Japan-ese institutions conspicuous and heavy sellers. Also depressing
sentiment has been some unease about the UK government's chances of winning
the next general election. The opposition Labour party has recently
reaffirmed its intention to renationalise the water companies if it wins the
election.
The Package was down over Pounds 100 at one point yesterday, but rallied to
close a net Pounds 42 off at Pounds 2968. Anglian Water weakened 10 to 286p,
while Southern dipped 8 to 270p and Severn Trent the same amount to 280p.
North West drew sustained support, closing unchanged at 296p after 291p.
Cronite returned from suspension with a reassuring directors' statement, and
the shares closed at 24p, double the April 5 suspension price.
Further speculation that the UK Ministry of Defence will shortly award its
much-mooted replacement tank contract to Vickers failed to support the
shares, which fell 7 to 218p. Vickers manufactures the Challenger tank, a
new and more sophisticated version of its old Chieftain series.
Downiebrae, the Glasgow-based steel profile and pipe flange manufacturer,
found favour ahead of Friday's annual results and ended 7 higher at 36p.

FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Amoco counters downtrend on
pleasing results

Wall Street
THE DOWNWARD trend in share prices established since record highs for the
major indices were reached last week continued yesterday, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37.87 at 2,927.72,
near its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell
3.25 to 380.95. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks, which
had enjoyed the best run since the start of the year, continued to
underperform yesterday, dropping 6.81 to 494.38.
Turnover on the New York SE was relatively light at 164m shares, and with
declining stocks outpacing rises by a margin of about three-to-one the weak
tone of the overall market was clearly evident.
The recent market rally was fuelled primarily by expectations of US economic
recovery, lower interest rates and a return to corporate profitability later
this year. These hopes are now fully discounted in share prices, and in the
absence of a strong lead from fresh economic news there is little reason for
investors to buy stocks at the moment, said analysts.
Among individual issues, quarterly earnings figures continued to produce a
mixed reaction. In the oil sector, Mobil initially rose against the market
trend after reporting a jump in three-monthly net income to Dollars 1.73 a
share, up from 94 cents posted in the first quarter of 1990. However, the
stock was unable to stand up against the general sell-off and closed down a
net Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 67 5/8 . Amoco proved more resilient, holding on
to its gain to end up Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 54 after also revealing
improved first-quarter earnings, up from the Dollars 466m of last year to
Dollars 803m.
The long-running bid battle between NCR and AT&amp;T took another turn yesterday
as NCR's stock forged ahead Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 101 7/8 on turnover of
1.8m shares after AT&amp;T said it was ready to improve its offer for the
computer group to the equivalent of Dollars 110 a share. The development
left AT&amp;T down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 36 1/4 on 2.7m traded.
NCNB retreated Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 37 in active trading after the
regional banking group said it had held merger talks with Southeast Bancorp
and was considering making an offer for the Florida group in the near
future. Southeast rose on the news at first, but eased back to close down
Dollars  1/4 on balance at Dollars 5 3/4 . Bankers Trust put on Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 49 in spite of unveiling a 19 per cent decline in first-quarter
profits to Dollars 160m.
Martin Marietta, the defence equipment manufacturer which makes components
for the Patriot anti-missile missile system used in the Gulf war, fell
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 55 in the wake of just a modest improvement in
first-quarter net income to Dollars 1.44 a share, against Dollars 1.32 a
share a year ago.
Canada
TORONTO partially recovered from an early decline during a quiet trading
session. The composite index was finally down just 4.4 at 3,491.6, while
declining stocks led advances by 333 to 205. Volume fell to 17m shares from
Friday's 35.4m.
Eight of the 14 sub-groups finished lower, although there were not any
significant declines. Energy, industrial products, financial services and
consumer products all posted small losses. The mining group ended steady
while golds gained 2.49 per cent.
Abitibi-Price, unchanged at CDollars 15 1/4 , saw its first-quarter loss
decrease to 9 cents a share from the 17 cents recorded a year earlier. The
company said it expects 1991 to be 'a difficult year'.

FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Germany falls 1.7 per cent on
Kohl party's defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEAKNESS of the German government and its currency dragged other bourses
lower yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT reacted to the crushing defeat for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic party in Sunday's state election in the Rhineland
Palatinate, Mr Kohl's home state, and yesterday's fall in the D-Mark to a
16-month low against the dollar.
After an 8.18 or 1.2 per cent fall in the broadly based FAZ index at
midsession, the DAX index closed 27.46, or 1.7 per cent down at 1,571.91,
its intraday low. The heavier falls in the blue chips, said Dresdner Bank in
Frankfurt, indicated that dealers were anticipating foreign selling.
However, the drop in German equity market turnover from DM5.5bn to DM5bn
indicated that prices were marked down, rather than forced down by selling
volume. By the end of the afternoon, too, the leaders were probably a shade
higher than the close on aggregate, in spite of a fall of more than 1 per
cent on Wall Street.
Daimler, Siemens and Deutsche Bank, the main international stocks, fell
DM10.50 to DM680.50, DM10.20 to DM583.30 and DM13 to DM628.50 respectively,
Daimler after stating that 1990 group operating profit was about 10 per cent
below the 1989 level and Siemens on higher net profit for the half year to
March.
PARIS slipped to a five-week low on the last day of the monthly account,
depressed by the French franc's weakness against the dollar and by a finance
scandal which threatened to endanger the government. The CAC-40 index lost
23.92 or 1.3 per cent to 1,767.20, its lowest close since March 20, in
volume estimated at just below FFr2bn. Trading was dominated by arbitrageurs
tidying up their positions at the end of the account.
Among the day's big losers was Paribas, down FFr14 to FFr443, with most of
the 123,025 shares traded attributed to arbitrage activity ahead of the
close of the share swap with Ciments Francais. Alcatel Alsthom, which was
weak last week, fell another that a consortium led by Alcatel had won a
FFr10bn train order from the French state railway. Peugeot gave up some of
last week's recovery, losing FFr10 to FFr543.
In the retail sector, Galeries Lafayette rose FFr70 or 4.1 per cent to
FFr1,800 in thin volume of 380 shares after the company said it would not
make a full bid for Nouvelles Galeries, in which it has a 38 per cent stake.
Nouvelles Galeries fell FFr40 or 5 per cent to FFr760 with 1,350 shares
traded.
MILAN fell across the board in moderate trading, reflecting declines on
foreign markets. Insurance and banking shares, which were sought after last
week, were particularly hard hit as speculative buying petered out. The
Comit index fell 6.65 to 595.99 in volume estimated below Friday's L170bn.
Trading is expected to quieten before the public holiday on Thursday.
Fiat fell L69 to L5,460 and dropped further to L5,435 after hours. Among the
insurers, Generali lost L400 to L38,100 but eased to L37,975 later in the
day, while among banks, Mediobanca fell L415 to L16,215.
Hopes that the protracted feud between Mr Carlo De Benedetti and Mr Silvio
Berlusoni for control of the publisher Mondadori would soon be resolved
lifted Cir, the holding company of Mr De Benedetti, to L2,680 after hours,
after an early fixing at L2,610, down L20. Shares in L'Espresso, 80 per cent
controlled by Mondadori, were suspended at L17,000 amid frantic buying
before being fixed L920 or 5.9 per cent higher at L16,500.
Olivetti eased L75 to L3,845 ahead of its 1990 results due tomorrow.
AMSTERDAM slumped in low volume on fears that the ever-stronger dollar would
do more harm than good to corporate earnings and force the Bundesbank to
raise rates to protect the D-Mark. Bonds were easier. The CBS Tendency index
fell 1.9 or 2 per cent to 94.1.
Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, lost Fl 1.70 to Fl 31.30 on a weekend
report in the Dutch press that the US airline AMR Corp might not convert 75
aircraft options into firm orders.
STOCKHOLM continued to worry about interest rates and first quarter results.
The Affarsvarlden general index fell 15.8 or 1.5 per cent to 1,058.1. Volume
fell from SKr308m to SKr264m, with one-third generated by Trelleborg and
Ericsson. Trelleborg free B shares fell SKr1 to SKr138 and Ericsson free B's
fell SKr7 to Skr192. SKF free B's fell SKr2 ahead of its first quarter
earnings report due today.
MADRID was lower. A 21 per cent increase consolidated net profit failed to
support Banco Santander, which fell Pta70 to Pta5,510. The general index
closed 2.85 lower at 279.58 in low turnover of Pta15bn.
BRUSSELS saw continued interest in Gechem, the polyurethane foam producer,
on rumours that Societe Generale de Belgique would soon sell its stake. The
ordinary shares jumped 5.9 per cent to BFr832. The Bel 20 index fell 7.54 to
1,203.29 in volume of BFr635m.
ZURICH saw the Credit Suisse index fall 7.3 to 550.0 as a slight firming in
domestic interest rates kept most investors on the sidelines.

FT  23 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar keeps up the gallop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR was very firm yesterday, particularly against the depressed
D-Mark. The defeat of the ruling Christian Democrats in Sunday's state
election in the Rhineland Palatinate, the home state of German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, increased downward pressure on the currency.
Mr Kohl's political difficulties weighed on the D-Mark at a time when it is
already suffering from the economic problems caused by German unification
and concern about growing instability in the Soviet Union.
The decline of the D-Mark weakened all members of the European exchange rate
mechanism against the dollar, but the US currency was strong in its own
right, improving against non-ERM units such as the Swiss franc and the
Japanese yen.
Hopes of a gradual recovery in US economic performance and fading
expectations of lower US interest rates helped to push the dollar up to
another 16-month high against the D-Mark. This followed on from the renewed
surge in demand seen on Friday.
There was no sign of central bank intervention as it broke through technical
resistance at DM1.7620 yesterday and touched the day's high at another
resistance point of DM1.7680, before closing in London at DM1.7660 compared
with DM1.7360 on Friday.
Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations meet in
Washington next weekend, amid concern at an apparent lack of agreement on
interest rate policy. It was also noted that the US administration's desire
for lower rates does not appear to be shared by members of the policy-making
US Federal Open Market Committee.
A US press report last week suggested that the FOMC has agreed that interest
rates may be low enough to end the recession. This coupled with concern
among some FOMC members about rekindling inflation if rates are cut were
major factors sparking the dollar's surge over the last two trading days.
At the London close the dollar had also advanced to Y139.40 from Y138.35; to
SFr1.4795 from SFr1.4705; and to FFr5.9475 from FFr5.8575. Its index climbed
to 67.1 from 66.3.
The D-Mark maintained the downward trend against the yen, which resumed last
Thursday after the Bundesbank council failed to increase official German
interest rates. In London the German currency finished at Y78.95, compared
with Y79.70 on Friday and Y81.00 on Thursday.
Sterling lost ground in the ERM, but stayed second strongest, according to
figures from the European Commission.
The pound fell 2.95 cents to Dollars 1.6925, after losing 5 cents on Friday.
It remained steady against the D-Mark, however, closing unchanged at
DM2.9900, while falling to FFr10.0650 from FFr10.0875; to SFr2.5050 from
SFr2.5325; and to Y236.00 from Y238.25. Sterling's index weakened 0.6 to
91.6. In New York the pound recovered a modest 30 points to end at Dollars
1.6955.

FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel development plans as
confidence is boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRM NICKEL prices and the prospect of sustained global growth have
persuaded Falconbridge Ltd to commit CDollars 35m (Pounds 17.6m) to
underground development at its remote Raglan property in northern Quebec
over the next 18 months.
Falconbridge, owned 50-50 by Noranda and Trelleborg of Sweden, is discussing
developing a mine at Raglan with annual output of 20,000 tonnes of nickel.
The cost would be around CDollars 375m, including infrastructure.
The property has been long known as Falconbridge's 'perennial mine of
tomorrow'. The deposit was found after World War II by the late Mr Murray
Watts, one of Canada's most successful mine finders. He was looking for
uranium as well as precious and base metals.
Falconbridge bought control of the property in 1957 and spent many millions
of dollars outlining the deposit. However, its location north of
Schefferville and the northern rail terminus, ruled out development.
Raglan is nearly 1,000 miles north east of Montreal and only 60 miles south
east of Deception Bay, on Hudson Strait, the shipping point for the former
Asbestos Hill mine. During the seventies asbestos fibre was mined openpit
and shipped for refining at Nordenheim in Germany until the US Environmental
Protection Agency finally knocked the bottom out of the international
asbestos market.
Last month, the ice-breaking freighter Arctic, used to move zinc ores from
the central Arctic to European refineries, successfully navigated the
forbidding ice in Deception Bay, tying up at the old asbestos dock.
This means the old three-month shipping season for asbestos can be extended
to eight months, helping Raglan's economics significantly. The mine could
operate year-round and production for four months be stockpiled.
Falconbridge will spend CDollars 20m at Raglan this year alone and has begun
a full feasibility study. Most of the money will go for an underground ramp,
lateral work and drilling.
Raglan is a series of deposits along a 30-mile strike length. Estimated
reserves are 18m tonnes averaging 3.13 per cent nickel and 0.88 per cent
copper in one group of mineralised zones. But total reserves are believed
much larger.
In terms of grade Raglan is the best undeveloped sulphide deposit anywhere,
believes Falconbridge.
The mine would be a fly-in/fly-out operation. A rail connection with
Schefferville was considered in the past, but the rugged terrain makes the
cost prohibitive. The tree line ends just north of Schefferville and the
permafrost then begins.
Potentially, Raglan could increase Falconbridge's annual nickel output by 25
to 30 per cent by 1996. Last year Falconbridge produced 62,000 tonnes from
its mines in Sudbury, Ontario, and in the Dominican Republic.
Nickel prices are around USDollars 4 a lb and many forecast tightness in
supply because of problems in the Soviet Union. Together the Soviet Union
and Cuba have been supplying between 12 and 15 per cent of western demand.
Falconbridge says production in Sudbury and the Dominican Republic will
remain flat for the next few years and Raglan would help retain its world
market share.

FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fears for farm budget if price
ceiling ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission expects the EC farm budget to run out of money
before the end of the year, if the community's agriculture ministers
continue to fail to agree to stay within the mandatory ceiling, or
'guideline', on farm price support.
Brussels is understood to have calculated that the first cash shortages in
the Common Agricultural Policy will appear around October, if ministers push
the tangled debate over this year's price package into June.
Such a delay looked altogether likely last night, as the council of
agriculture ministers began their third attempt since February to fix this
year's prices - by agreeing that any accord would have to wait until next
month at the earliest.
Ten of the 12 farm ministers reiterated their demands that the ceiling be
raised to take account of what they claim is the unforeseen cost of
integrating east German farms into the CAP.
Led by France and Ireland, they want to soften the cuts proposed by the
commission on February 27.
These cuts are intended to limit the rise in farm spending this year to
Ecu7.4bn, a record 30 per cent leap from last year, touching the ceiling of
Ecu32.5bn (Dollars 40bn).
Only the UK, and, with some dithering, the Netherlands, are holding fast to
the guideline, both in the council of farm ministers and finance ministers,
whose unanimous agreement would be needed to breach it.
The UK's fiscally rigid stance was one of three emerging from yesterday's
farm council. In addition:
Ireland was advocating the adoption of the guideline but creation of 'an ad
hoc mechanism', a special reserve, in case it is broken. In common with
France and others, the Irish believe the commission has overreacted to
one-off effects on the beef market, such as the 'mad cow' scare and the Gulf
crisis, has exaggerated overproduction trends, is overly pessimistic about
world farm prices, and has misjudged how fast the dollar is strengthening so
reducing the cost of export subsidies.
France appears still to want to take the wrangle to the European summit due
in June, in the hope of winning sanction for a higher guideline, having
failed to get it on to the agenda of the special summit here on April 8,
devoted almost entirely to the Kurdish emergency.
The finance ministers meeting which took place alongside that summit
replicated the 10-2 division among farm ministers over the guideline.
However, it was a European summit, in Brussels in February 1988, which set
the yearly ceilings.
The Irish idea of a special reserve would, commission and UK officials say,
require the unlikely unanimity of the finance ministers.
However, one of its underlying premises - that Brussels has done its sums
wrong - appears to be buttressed by figures from the commission's periodic
'early warning system' survey of expenditure. These show that price support
to the end of this month has been underspent by Ecu1.1bn. France also
pressed last night for an update.
But commission officials maintain that the seeming underspend is because
certain member states, Italy in particular, are behind in paying out
subsidies to their farmers.
They also dismiss the contention that the stronger dollar will save the
guideline, since its effect will not feed through until next year.
There is concern in the commission, however, that if a summit were to
address farm spending, it might fix guidelines into the future, and queer
the pitch for the radical reform of the CAP which Mr Ray MacSharry, EC
agriculture commissioner, is due to present in detail by July.
Its preferred alternative may in the end be simply to roll over last year's
price package, keep formally within the 1991 guideline and pass on surplus
spending to next year, when it hopes to start the reform.

FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru cuts taxes and declares
mining emergency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori has declared a state of emergency in the Peruvian
mining industry and announced tax concessions to give the beleaguered sector
a breathing space.
From July, small and medium-sized mines will be exempted from the current 5
per cent emergency tax on copper export. Output from mines in this category
is worth Dollars 750m (Pounds 441m) a year, or over a third of Peru's
earnings from mining. Peru's important silver mining sector will also
benefit from new 'drawback' measures which allow it to reclaim income and
business equity taxes.
Although the measures were welcomed by Mr Luis Rodriguez Mariategui, head of
the National Mining Society, (SNM), it is not clear whether they are in time
to save about 14 medium-sized mines under threat of closure. For example
Huaron, a leading silver, zinc and lead producer has been losing Dollars
800,000 a month since January and is now said to have debts of almost
Dollars 13m.
While plummeting international silver prices mean that silver producers have
been worst hit, the entire sector is in poor shape. Preliminary figures for
1990 indicate that direct losses may be around Dollars 130m, close to those
registered in 1986, the worst year in the last decade. State-owned giant
Centromin lost Dollars 50m last year and is contemplating drastic personnel
cuts. Only five mining companies reported profits last year, according to
preliminary data - Southern Peru Copper, Orcopampa, Milpo, Simsa and Arcata.
Copper output fell 13 per cent in 1990 from 1989, while silver and iron
production declined 15 and 20 per cent respectively. Spare parts and
maintenance problems at HierroPeru, the country's sole iron producer, meant
a fall in iron output from 2.9m tons in 1989 to 2.1m last year. High
international metals prices partially masked the crisis - but this year is
likely to be worse, according to industry sources.
Speaking at the close of the national Mining Engineers' Convention in Lima,
President Fujimori acknowledged the importance of the mining industry. It
generates over half of all foreign exchange earnings and employs one in five
of the population. The solution to the sector's problems, he recognised, lay
in a more realistic exchange rate and lower interest rates.
The dollar-inti exchange rate has scarcely moved since December. The inti is
over-valued by a factor of three, according to the mining industry. Mr David
Ballon, president of the Mining Engineers' Institute says the sector has
lost Dollars 1.62bn in the last two years alone through exchange rate lag.
This has meant low levels of reinvestment and failure to spend on
exploration. Many mines' proven reserves are now perilously low.
Short-term debts also plague the sector. Mines have been forced to borrow
heavily to pay taxes levied on total sales, rather than profits and run
between 20 and 30 per cent of turnover. Interest rates exceed 20 per cent a
month, in spite of a gradual fall in inflation, down to 7.7 per cent last
month. Mining companies' debt positions have been exacerbated by Centromin's
failure for the past several months to pay suppliers.
Participants from abroad at the convention emphasised the need for Peru to
stabilise tax policies and standardise contracts along Chilean lines.
Their call appeared to have been heard by President Fujimori. He promised to
promote mining investment under extraordinary facilities recently granted by
parliament. This, he said, would make laws 'more flexible,' attract risk
capital and favour joint ventures.
If the main problem for Peruvian miners continues to be the exchange rate,
there is another to which there is no solution yet in sight - terrorism. The
SNM counts 304 terrorist actions directed at mining companies during the
last decade, mainly with the object of stealing explosives and other
supplies. Attacks have left 62 dead, it calculates, with a disturbing recent
rise - 14 mining employees were killed in remote mountain camps in December
last year alone.

FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian government support
package criticised as too little
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S federal government plans to bolster 1991 farm income by CDollars
425m (Pounds 214m) this spring through its Farm Support and Adjustment
Programme.
It claims that this will bring realised farm income to CDollars 3.3bn from
Dollars 3bn in 1990. Realised income is operating profit after depreciation.
But both western and eastern farm groups said that this would not be nearly
enough to counter the farm crisis, particularly on the prairies.
Incomes will remain under pressure from the continuing wheat trade war
between the US and Europe, and the impact of Canada-US free trade on
horticulture.
Western groups were the most critical. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool said that
the prairies alone needed CDollars 1.3bn this year to offset low prices and
'they gave us Dollars 200m.'
However, Mr Donald Mazankowski, the federal agriculture minister, said that
the government 'just doesn't have the dollars.'
The Farm Support programme replaces emergency annual bail-outs, with income
insurance designed to guarantee participating farmers 90 per cent of
long-term average income in case of crop disasters or low commodity prices.
Further changes in the system are due next year.
The federal government picks up part of the premiums but most provinces have
delayed their contributions and farmers have been slow to sign up. Mr
Mazankowski agrees that the premiums are high.
The government has also announced modest help for horticulture and direct
financial incentives to prairie farmers to take marginal land out of
production.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Capital Markets (Government Bonds): German
bonds tumble as election gloom deepens

GERMAN government bonds opened sharply lower yesterday as the market reacted
to the defeat of the ruling Christian Democratic Party in state elections in
the Rhineland Palatinate.
The bund futures contract on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange fell to 84.98 during the morning, against Friday's close of 85.27.
However, the market showed resilience in later trading and the contract
closed at 85.15.
The benchmark 10 per cent government bond maturing 2001 closed on a yield of
8.44 per cent, down from an opening level of 8.38 per cent.
The election defeat gives the opposition Social Democrats an overall
majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament.
The Bundesrat can block any legislation which affects the financing of the
regional lander (such as planned VAT increases and reform of the corporate
tax structure) and any moves to change the way in which the regions are
administered. The gloom was increased by the weakness of the D-Mark on the
foreign exchange market against the dollar. The US currency opened at around
DM1.74 but fell back to trade at around DM1.7640 in late afternoon.
There are fears that the strong dollar could increase import prices, adding
to inflationary pressures in the domestic economy.
Any signs of additional inflationary pressure would be countered by tighter
monetary conditions. Fears of further tightening by the Bundesbank
suppressed bond prices at the shorter maturities end more than at the
10-year maturity.
UK government bond prices showed little reaction to retail sales figures for
March which pointed to a sharp upturn in consumer expenditure.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent government bond issue maturing 2003/2007
opened at 110 9/32 and closed just  1/32 down on the day, for a yield of
10.22 per cent.
Figures showing retail sales growth of 3.7 per cent for March over the
previous month were dismissed as a freak by analysts.
Most had predicted a month-on-month upturn of between 0.3 per cent and 0.7
per cent. The unexpected increase was blamed on a rush by consumers to buy
goods before the new rate of VAT (17.5 per cent against 15 per cent at the
old rate) came into effect on April 1. Elsewhere, the evidence remains
mixed. Money supply figures on Friday showed M0, the narrow measure of notes
and coins in circulation, growing at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent. Yet
bank lending was recorded at an all-time low.
JAPANESE government bonds fell back during Tokyo trading as the yen
continued to depreciate against the dollar on the foreign exchange markets.
The benchmark government bond issue No129 closed in Tokyo on a yield of
6.725 per cent, against a close of 6.705 per cent on Friday. In London
trading the 129 slipped further for a yield of 6.73 per cent by late
afternoon.
Trading remained focused on the foreign exchange market, where the dollar
continued to move higher against the major currencies, including the yen.
The US currency opened at Y138.75 and pressed ahead to around Y139.30 by the
close of London trading.
The strength of the dollar will, if sustained, increase the cost of many
imported goods into Japan. This could delay any easing of monetary
conditions by the Bank of Japan later this year.
Tomorrow, the government is expected to issue Y800bn of 10-year securities,
with a coupon of either 6.7 per cent or 6.8 per cent.
IN THE absence of a lead from economic news US government bond prices edged
lower yesterday ahead of this week's injection of fresh supply by the
Treasury. In late trading the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was down  1/2
at 95 13/32 , to yield 8.285 per cent. The two-year note was only slightly
lower, down  1/32 at 100 1/8 , yielding 7.034 per cent.
The market appears resigned to the fact that the Federal Reserve is not
going to cut interest rates in the near future. The sell-off that came in
the wake of the Fed's inaction is complete, and yesterday's weakness was
primarily a technical move ahead of the two and five-year note auctions due
on Wednesday and Thursday this week, said dealers.
In the money markets the Fed intervened via overnight matched sales
agreements to drain reserves from the system and exert an upward pressure on
the Fed funds rate. The Fed's target for the rate remains 6 per cent, and
yesterday Fed funds were trading just below it at 5 13/16 per cent.

The group blamed recession at home and an overvalued cruzeiro for the feeble

<TEXT>
FIRST-QUARTER earnings at Union Carbide, the US chemicals producer, would
have matched last year's levels were it not for the serious disruption
caused by an explosion last month at its chemicals plant at Seadrift, Texas.
Net earnings dropped to Dollars 83m or 54 cents a share from Dollars 94m or
65 cents a share. Sales slipped by 3 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn.
Union Carbide estimates that the Seadrift explosion cost it about Dollars
18m in lost profits. It expects to restore most ethylene and polyethylene
production at the plant by the end of this month, but production of ethylene
dioxide and related products is unlikely to restart before the summer.
Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman, said the first-quarter earnings were better
than expected, thanks to falling raw material costs and strong export
shipments of some chemicals, especially ethylene glycol.
But he warned that the recession and extra capacity coming on stream may
dampen chemicals and plastics earnings for the rest of this year.
Industrial gas sales fell by 17 per cent in the quarter.

643m tax claim

<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to rehabilitate Executive Life of California, the main operating
unit of troubled Los Angeles-based insurer First Executive, have run into a
serious obstacle from the Internal Revenue Service, which claims to be owed
Dollars 643m.
Mr John Garamendi, the Californian insurance commissioner who seized control
of Executive Life earlier this month, warned that the move 'could force the
company into liquidation and jeopardise the savings of hundreds of thousands
of policyholders and annuitants'.
The Los Angeles office of the IRS, however, said that while it was obviously
concerned about policyholders' welfare, it had a duty to the US public to
make sure that demands for back tax were logged.
The IRS claim covers tax which the authorities say the company should have
paid in 1981, 1982 and 1983, together with penalties and interest due
because of the non-payment. The IRS declined to split the tax sum from the
penalty/interest charges, although there were reports that the actual tax
claim totalled less than Dollars 250m.
The IRS acknowledged that the penalties/interest element was likely to be
substan-tial.
The Californian regulators have recently suggested that rehabilitation
efforts were centring on talks with a European consortium, led by Altus,
part of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank.
Yesterday, officials at the Insurance Department said they did not know what
the reaction of the consortium had been to the tax demand.
However, Mr Garamendi said that he would 'do everything in my power to stop
this IRS raid on the assets needed to pay Executive Life policyholders. I
plan to immediately contact both the Bush administration and Congressional
leaders,' he added.

ITT, the US conglomerate with interests ranging from defence to insurance,
yesterday reported a 9.4 per cent fall in first-quarter profits, to Dollars
229m after tax.
Earnings per share also fell away, from Dollars 1.77 to Dollars 1.7, but, in
both cases, comparisons were distorted by one-off items. On the one hand,
the first quarter of 1991 took in portfolio gains of Dollars 35m - or 26
cents a share - mainly at ITT Hartford, the insurance arm. This contrasted
with portfolio gains of Dollars 4m, or three cents a share, in the same
period a year earlier.
On the other hand, the first quarter of 1990 was boosted by an after-tax
gain of Dollars 47m from the sale of the stake in Alcatel Alsthom. ITT said
that without this item net income in the first quarter would have improved
by 18 per cent.
ITT said that its electronic components business improved on higher volumes
and better efficiencies at ITT semiconductors. ITT Defence also had a better
quarter due to more favourable margins on certain contracts.

restructuring
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OCCIDENTAL Petroleum has begun to reap the tax benefits of a Dollars 2.2bn
restructuring charge taken after the death last December of Dr Armand
Hammer, who presided over the Los Angeles-based energy and chemicals group
for more than half a century.
Net first-quarter earnings were Dollars 136m or 45 cents a share, up from
Dollars 108m (37 cents a share) a year earlier. The latest figure, however,
includes a Dollars 53m tax benefit from operating loss carryforwards created
by last year's restructuring. These carryforwards, which totalled Dollars
1.7bn last December, can be set against taxes on operating income and
capital gains. They are recorded as an extraordinary item.
Mr Ray Irani, who took over as chairman when Dr Hammer died, has taken the
scalpel to Occidental with the aim of concentrating on the core businesses
of oil, gas and chemicals. He has put several of Dr Hammer's pet projects on
the block, and laid off 1,000 employees. He signalled a break from the past
by moving the annual meeting from Dr Hammer's birthday on May 20 to a date
10 days earlier.
Oil and gas earnings in the first quarter rose 22 per cent to Dollars 122m,
reflecting higher oil prices and production, higher international natural
gas volumes and improved domestic gas liquids prices.
On the other hand, earnings from chemicals dipped by 25 per cent to Dollars
139m, as a result, among other things, of higher feedstock prices and lower
farm products volumes.
Amoco Corp lifted its first-quarter earnings by 6 per cent to Dollars 803m
or Dollars 1.60 a share from Dollars 466m, or 91 cents a share a year
earlier, due largely to a benefit from a change in accounting for income
taxes. Excluding this benefit, earnings of the Chicago-based energy producer
rose 6 per cent to Dollars 492m. Refining and marketing income rose to
Dollars 214m from Dollars 129m, due to wider refining margins.
On the other hand, earnings from exploration and production fell steeply,
both in the US and internationally. The drop was due to lower natural gas
prices, a fall in domestic crude oil output and higher exploration expenses.
Olin, the Connecticut-based chemicals and special metals producer, took an
Dollars 80m charge in the first quarter as part of a restructuring. Other
measures include a 10 per cent cut in the salaried workforce and the sale of
several businesses.
These include industrial phosphates, electronic chemical and inter-connect
operations, and some small chemical and metal product lines. As a result
Olin suffered a first-quarter loss of Dollars 59m (Dollars 2.20 a share),
against earnings of Dollars 32m (Dollars 1.60 a share) a year earlier.

MARTIN Marietta, the US aerospace company whose Patriot missiles hit the
headlines during the Gulf war, lifted first-quarter earnings by 6 per cent
to Dollars 71.1m after tax,from Dollars 67.1m in the same period a year ago.
But revenues fell to Dollars 1.4bn from Dollars 1.42bn. Marietta said the
fall stemmed partly from non-recurring sales from a commercial Titan rocket
launch in the first quarter of 1990, and partly from the effects of the
recession and poor weather.
At the operating level, Marietta reported a slightly sharper rise of 13 per
cent to Dollars 108m. But 'other income' fell to Dollars 1.7m from Dollars
6.8m, while interest expenses rose from Dollars 10.2m to Dollars 12.1m. The
earnings per share figure was much in line with analysts' expectations, at
Dollars 1.44, against Dollars 1.32.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Capital Cities/ABC hit by
recession and war costs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE IMPACT of recession on advertising and the cost of covering the Gulf war
has cut the profitability of Capital Cities/ABC, one of the three big US
television networks. It yesterday unveiled a 38 per cent slump in
first-quarter operating income to Dollars 130.3m and warned of a further
decline in the second quarter.
The company owns the ABC radio and television national networks, local
television and radio stations and weekly newspapers, including the Fairchild
fashion trade publications. First-quarter net income fell 45 per cent to
Dollars 58.6m or Dollars 3.50 a share from Dollars 106.3m or Dollars 6.08 a
year earlier on revenues essentially unchanged at Dollars 1.26bn. Operating
income was Dollars 130.3m, against Dollars 211.5m a year ago, while income
before taxes dropped 44 per cent to Dollars 103.4m from Dollars 186.2m.
Capital Cities/ABC's weak first-quarter performance comes on the heels of
poor results from CBS and General Electric's NBC broadcasting, which were
also hurt by higher news costs and the very weak advertising market.
Revenues from the company's broadcasting operating advanced to Dollars 1bn
from Dollars 992.5m, due to the telecast of the Super Bowl and two National
Football League Wild Card play-off games.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Weak dollar hits Bankers Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS Trust, the highly- regarded US banking group, suffered a 19 per cent
fall in first-quarter earnings, with a strong advance in trading income more
than offset by higher non-interest expenses, lower foreign exchange revenues
and write-offs on investments in highly-leveraged companies.
Net earnings slipped to Dollars 160m or Dollars 1.85 a share from Dollars
198m or Dollars 2.36 a year earlier. Interest income fell only slightly to
Dollars 213m.
The company blamed an 8.4 per cent rise in non-interest expenses partly on
the weaker dollar, which accounted for about a quarter of the increase.
Staff severance costs jumped by Dollars 40m.
Trading revenues almost doubled to Dollars 304m, thanks largely to a strong
performance by the capital markets business, which includes interest rate,
currency and equity derivative products. But corporate finance fees tumbled
by 23 per cent.
Loans on BT's books continue to fall sharply, reflecting the policy of the
past four years of distributing a higher proportion of loans to other
financial institutions, such as regional and foreign banks, insurance
companies and pension funds. BT's total loan portfolio stood at Dollars
19.6bn on March 31, down from Dollars 29.2bn in 1986.
BT is less exposed to the depressed real estate market than some other US
money-centre banks, but it has nonetheless not been left unscarred. The bank
lifted loan-loss provisions to Dollars 51m from Dollars 40m a year earlier.
Non-performing assets, other than renegotiated Third World debt, jumped to
Dollars 164m on March 31 from Dollars 65m. Real estate credits made up the
bulk of the increase.

<TEXT>
AVON Products, the world's biggest maker of cosmetics and toiletries,
yesterday turned in a 20 per cent improvement in first-quarter net income.
The result included strong gains from the company's overseas operations
offsetting the deteriorating performance of its US business.
For the first three months of 1991, Avon had net income of Dollars 18.4m or
16 cents a share against Dollars 15.2m or 11 cents a year ago. Revenues grew
9 per cent to Dollars 769.6m from Dollars 703.8m.
The 1991 figures include a Dollars 7m settlement with Chartwell Associates,
the investor group which recently agreed to abstain from launching a proxy
fight for increased control of Avon's board for 10 years, after nearly two
years of consistent pressure on Avon.
Mr James Preston, Avon's chairman, said the company expects a good year in
1991 thanks to its strong international position. 'Avon continues to benefit
from having a global portfolio of businesses that minimises the impact of a
recession in one country or region.'
The New York-based company said pre-tax profits from its international
business grew 40 per cent in the quarter on a 25 per cent improvement on
sales, led by Europe and the Americas. In the US, Avon's pre-tax profit fell
12 per cent on a 7 per cent decline in sales. This reflected the continued
impact of recession, particularly in the northeast.
Avon, which has been steadily reducing its debt, said debt at the end of the
1991 first quarter was Dollars 572.7m, down 18 per cent on a year earlier.

KOHLBERG, Kravis, Roberts, the New York buy-out investment boutique and one
of the most powerful takeover players in the US, and Fleet/Norstar Financial
group have succeeded in their joint bid to acquire most of the assets of the
failed Bank of New England (BNE), once the second-biggest bank in the
region.
The three BNE 'bridge banks', with combined assets of about Dollars 15bn,
will be managed by Fleet, which will raise Dollars 683m of new capital
including Dollars 283m to be provided by investors advised by KKR. The
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp will receive Dollars 125m as a premium -
Dollars 100m in preferred stock and Dollars 25m in cash.
BNE was declared insolvent and seized by regulators in January.
The KKR/Fleet Norstar group had competed against BankAmerica, the big San
Francisco bank and Bank of Boston in a bidding contest for BNE, whose assets
are estimated at Dollars 20bn. Mr William Seidman, FDIC chairman, said:
'Based on an analysis of the proposals the board determined that selecting
Fleet would have the lowest cost to the bank insurance fund.'
Mr Seidman said KKR would not exercise control of bank activity. The FDIC
said the cost of the bailout would cost the treasury about 10 per cent more
than the Dollars 2.3bn originally estimated.
The assistance package, agreed in principle, will give Fleet the right to
put to the FDIC any classified loans and repossessed assets now on the books
of the bridge banks for three years.
The decision to award BNE to the Fleet/Norstar group raises questions about
the future of Bank of Boston. 1990. According to some analysts, there is
concern that without the capital from BNE, Bank of Boston may fail.
Mr Ira Stepanian, chairman of Bank of Boston, said a BNE acquisition would
have accelerated Bank of Boston's recovery, 'but the FDIC's decision by no
means negates it.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IFI International (Ifint), the Luxembourg-based holding company partly owned
by Italy's Agnelli family, has acquired an option to become the largest
single shareholder in Exor, the investment group which controls the Perrier
mineral water group.
Ifint told the French stockmarket authorities yesterday that it could raise
its existing 13.5 per cent stake in Exor, to just over 21 per cent. However,
a Perrier spokesman said the deal will have no impact on the mineral water
group.
It is not known whether Ifint plans to exercise its option, although the
mere fact of owning it means the group is considered under French law to
have lifted its stake in Exor to above 20 per cent, at which level it has to
make an announcement.
If Ifint exercises its option, it will overtake Ms Corinne Mentzelopoulos,
whose family is Exor's main shareholder and who now owns 18.6 per cent of
the group. Analysts said this is unlikely to change the Mentzelopoulos'
control of Exor.
Exor made no comment yesterday and securities analysts confessed to being
baffled by the deal. The Agnelli family could be strengthening its French
industrial portfolio, which already includes stakes in BSN, the food group,
Accor in hotels, and the Pechelbronn holding group, said Mr Sylvain Massot,
food and beverages analyst at Morgan Stanley's London office.
Ifint paid around FFr700m (Dollars 119.5m) for its existing 13.5 per cent
share in Exor in January, making it then the group's third biggest
shareholder.
It has now acquired options for another 7.86 per cent from Rovida, a
Swiss-based holding company and currently the second largest shareholder,
which had 18.2 per cent of Exor's stock.
Ifint, 23 per cent of whose ordinary shares are owned by the
Agnelli-controlled Istituto Finanziario Industriale, bought its stake as
part of a complex share swap with Ms Mentzelopoulos.

FT  23 APR 91 / Treuhand poised to boost German paper market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLEDGLING German commercial paper market is to receive an important
boost from the Treuhand, the state-backed agency responsible for privatising
east German companies, through plans for a large borrowing programme to
finance restructuring investments.
The Treuhand is today expected to announce a commercial paper programme,
arranged by Dresdner Bank, of up to DM2bn (Pounds 600m), making it the
largest programme of its kind since the market began to take shape earlier
this year. If the issue runs smoothly, the Treuhand may test the market
again to cover more of its DM25bn borrowing limit for 1991.
Some Treuhand officials have speculated that the organisation will make use
of commercial paper, among other instruments, gradually to take over up to
DM70bn of the DM100bn in old debts that the corporate sector in former east
Germany is still theoretically carrying.
The Treuhand is already paying interest to the Bundesbank on those debts and
some analysts believe that it would be better to centralise the debt under
one roof. The Bonn finance ministry admits that much of the corporate debt
will not be repaid but it officially prefers a case-by-case policy on debt
forgiveness.
The commercial paper market is only available to the best risk borrowers who
then acquire relatively favourable terms. The Treuhand can exploit its
semi-government status to save money on its extensive borrowing needs. The
maturity of the first issue is expected to be one year.
The Treuhand declined to comment yesterday on when, if at all, it intended
to tap the commercial paper market, but finance ministry officials confirmed
that such a move, rumoured for some time, was now imminent.
The move is likely to be welcomed in Frankfurt where financiers will be keen
to see the commercial paper market given some ballast. German companies have
long complained of restricted financing options in their home market and the
shortage has forced them to turn to the Euromarkets.
Commercial paper only became possible in Germany earlier this year when the
Bundesbank withdrew its previous objections, finance ministry permission for
such issues was no longer required, and the turnover tax on securities was
abolished.
Since then, the biggest issue announced, although not yet completed, was a
DM500m programme for Daimler Benz arranged by Deutsche Bank. Daimler already
has a commercial paper programme in Dutch guilders and in dollars.

FT  23 APR 91 / Ratners to shed jobs despite profit rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS Group, the jewellery chain, will implement a cost-cutting programme
this year leading to the loss of up to 1,000 jobs, as it tries to combat
recessionary markets in the UK and the US.
Although the company pushed annual pre-tax profits up from Pounds 108.22m to
Pounds 110.05m before property gains, Ratners' fully-diluted earnings per
share fell 9 per cent to 23.6p as cost increases outstripped sales growth.
Mr Gerald Ratner, chairman, said the company would reduce staff by 5 per
cent as well as cut stockholding and distribution costs and trim some of its
guarantees and credit terms. 'It is no good just hibernating like a hedgehog
during a recession,' he said.
Sales in the year to February 2 topped Pounds 1bn for the first time,
climbing 24 per cent to Pounds 1.11bn.
The results were buoyed up by the inclusion of Kay Jewelers, the US chain
which was bought for Pounds 207m last year. Kay, which has been quickly
integrated with Ratners' existing Sterling business in the US, contributed
Pounds 14m to operating profits.
Overall, operating profits rose 3.6 per cent to Pounds 134.25m. The UK saw a
reduced contribution of Pounds 79.74m (Pounds 93.37m), but the US added
Pounds 54.5m (Pounds 36.12m).
Most of Ratners' UK high street chains registered comparable sales
increases: H. Samuel produced a 13 per cent gain; Ratners, 18 per cent; and
Zales and Ernest Jones 19 per cent.
Watches of Switzerland, the group's most upmarket chain, suffered from a
drop in tourists and recorded an 11 per cent slide in sales, while
Salisburys, the handbag chain, incurred a loss of Pounds 1m. Salisburys will
be trimmed from 220 stores to 170 at an exceptional cost of Pounds 2m. An
extraordinary charge of Pounds 6.74m was also taken as a result of the
company's decision to shut its Regent Jewellers chain, which operates 43
stock clearance branches.
Ratners said it had increased its market share in the UK by 3 percentage
points to 33 per cent and that it now commanded 5 per cent of the US market.
Mr Ratner said: 'With the competition collapsing there is nothing out there
to stop us.'
A final dividend of 7.6p will lift the annual pay-out to 10p, a 5 per cent
increase.
Ratners Group said that Sir Victor Garland, a non-executive director of the
Prudential Corporation, had joined the board as a non-executive director.

FT  23 APR 91 / AT&amp;T raises stakes in battle for NCR: Offer for computer
maker increased to Dollars 110 per share in paper bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The hostile takeover battle for NCR took a dramatic turn this week when
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications group, offered to
increase its bid to Dollars 110-a-share. However, the new proposal also
suggested replacing the cash consideration by all-paper terms.
Yesterday, NCR said that it was concerned that the AT&amp;T offer might not be
worth as much as Dollars 110 a share by the time the offer closed, if AT&amp;T
shares fell heavily. 'That's the sticking point,' said an NCR official.
NCR, the fifth-largest computer manufacturer in the US, has been in
discussions all weekend with AT&amp;T officials. The NCR board has yet to make
any official comment on the proposal announced late on Sunday night.
If AT&amp;T is now in sight of achieving its aim of buying NCR, the only sure
winners are likely to be NCR's own shareholders.
The takeover battle is likely to cost AT&amp;T Dollars 1.36bn more than it
bargained for; and there will be no guarantee that AT&amp;T's dreams of building
a successful global information technology company - spanning computers and
communications - can be realised.
NCR shareholders will have seen the value of their investments increase
almost two and a third times in the past four months if the latest proposal
goes ahead.
They owe thanks for their good fortune to the rugged determination of Mr
Charles 'Chuck' Exley, NCR president, to hold out for the best possible
price once it seemed clear there was no hope of resisting AT&amp;T's embrace.
It was not a universally popular attitude. NCR's shareholders interested in
the future of the company as a computer business applaud Mr Exley's apparent
intransigence; those who are interested chiefly in realising the value of
their investment as quickly as possible - Wall Street's arbitrage community
 -think he has merely been dragging out the inevitable.
AT&amp;T's opening bid in December last year - at Dollars 90 a share - valued
NCR at Dollars 6.12bn. Although Mr Exley immediately rejected the offer -
arguing there was no industrial logic in the takeover - he suggested that
the companies could do business if AT&amp;T valued NCR at Dollars 8.5bn or
Dollars 125 a share.
From that point, resistance deteriorated into price haggling. Mr Exley
reduced his demand to Dollars 110 a share while Mr Robert Allen, chairman of
AT&amp;T, raised his offer first to Dollars 100 a share and then two days ago to
NCR's asking price. The latest offer values the company at Dollars 7.48bn.
Under AT&amp;T's new proposal, investors would get 2.943 AT&amp;T shares for every
NCR share held. AT&amp;T claimed that this was the equivalent of Dollars 110 a
share, based on AT&amp;T's close on Friday.
To protect NCR investors against a future fall in AT&amp;T stock, the bidder
said it would be willing to offer up to 3.099 shares if the price averaged
less than Dollars 37.375 during a 20-day period ahead of an NCR shareholder
meeting to vote on the merger. Yesterday, NCR's shares rose Dollars 5 1/8 to
Dollars 101 7/8 - well short of the Dollars 110 figure - with AT&amp;T falling
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 .
The new offer could break the impasse in what has been one of the most
bitterly-fought takeover battles the modern computer industry has ever
witnessed. If the offer is accepted, then AT&amp;T will have spent more than
Dollars 12m in legal fees and NCR about Dollars 7m on its defensive
strategy.
From the outset, a sizeable proportion of NCR's shareholders had wanted to
accept the AT&amp;T bid. AT&amp;T, however, was constrained from simply buying
shares in the market by Maryland's takeover laws.
NCR showed an appetite for the fight which surprised those familiar with its
sleepy marketing methods. It deployed a series of 'poison pill' defences
including an employee share ownership scheme, which was later declared
invalid.
AT&amp;T set up a proxy battle at the NCR shareholders' meeting in March and
succeeded in ousting four directors, including the chairman.
AT&amp;T's battle for NCR is, however, likely to prove only the beginning of a
very long road for North America's largest telecommunications company.
The history of mergers between large electronics groups is stained with red
ink and littered with failures.
Unisys, for example, the world's fifth-largest computer company forged five
years ago from parts of Sperry and the Burroughs Corporation, lost Dollars
436m in 1990. It is still struggling to resolve the problem of two
completely different product families.
Siemens-Nixdorf, put together just over 12 months ago from the loss-making
Nixdorf and the barely-profitable computer operations of Siemens, is
expected to lose money this year. It is proving difficult to find common
ground between the radically different cultures of the two companies.
Groupe Bull, which two years ago took over the US personal computer
manufacturer, Zenith, has been experiencing similar problems. This is
despite Groupe Bull's declared intention to manage the company at arms
length from the rest of its computer operations.
Groupe Bull is being propped up with FFr4bn (Pounds 397m) of investment from
its largest shareholder, the French government.
Furthermore, over the past decade both AT&amp;T and International Business
Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, have made abortive
efforts to invade each other's territory.
AT&amp;T's basic plan is to merge its small and unsuccessful computer business
into NCR, leaving the Ohio-based company essentially alone to manage the
business. Superficially, it is an attractive idea.
For a new computer company to stand a chance of success today it must:
Have identified a market niche in which it can be a leader;
Offer products based on low-cost, standard microprocessor chips;
Offer 'open' systems based on standard operating software; Have firm control
of 'channels' - dealers, value-added resellers and software houses who
provide the conduit between the manufacturers and their customers.
AT&amp;T developed, and owns copyright on, the software system, Unix, which most
manufacturers now agree will become the industry standard for open systems.
NCR, alone among the large computer manufacturers, has taken the plunge into
designs based on low-cost microprocessors and the Unix operating system.
Despite the fact that it is not among the world's top 10 computer
manufacturers, NCR is a leading supplier of financial systems and dominates
the market for automated teller machines - 'holes-in-the-wall'.
NCR, which began as a manufacturer of cash registers in the 1800s, would
give AT&amp;T's computer ambitious a powerful fillip through its distribution
channels. It has already been identified by Europe's largest manufacturers
as a potential route into the US market.
The big question is whether it will be possible for the staff of two such
different companies to work together profitably.
AT&amp;T has no record of success in computers. Its computer division turns over
about Dollars 1.5bn a year and loses about Dollars 200m.
A merger with NCR may be its last chance. But if it fails, it will bring the
computer manufacturer down with it and Chuck Exley's worst fears about a
merger he never wanted will have been realised.

FT  23 APR 91 / CBI finds upbeat outlook on R&amp;D: Survey contrasts sharply
with last month's gloomy report from the Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURPRISINGLY upbeat picture of investment in innovation by UK businesses,
in spite of the recession, emerges from a survey by the Confederation of
British Industry.
According to the CBI's second annual innovation trends survey, 55 per cent
of UK manufacturing companies are satisfied that their spending on
innovation is adequate to meet future competitive pressures, while 37 per
cent think it is inadequate.
The survey contrasts sharply with the tone of last month's House of Lords
report on innovation in manufacturing industry, which claimed that
British-owned manufacturing industry could almost disappear if the
government did not abandon its 'hands-off' attitude.
Mr John Banham, CBI director-general, said yesterday there was no sense of
complacency in its trends survey. He added: 'The facts do not sit well with
the conclusions of the Lords committee - translated into plain English they
were wrong'.
Mr Banham said UK businesses spent Pounds 6.5bn on research and development
in 1989, a higher proportion of gross domestic product than any other
European Community country except Germany. The survey showed that on balance
this was being maintained last year.
'All is by no means gloom and doom, which is what you might conclude if you
were an avid reader of the Lords report,' he said.
Two thirds of the 336 companies taking part in the survey spent up to 5 per
cent of sales on innovation - which is defined as the development of new
products, processes and services - and just over one fifth spent up to 10
per cent.
The survey identified a marked trend downwards in the use of consultants and
a rise in expenditure on joint ventures or co-operation with other
companies, particularly overseas. New regulations, especially tougher
environmental rules, were seen by some companies as an opportunity and by
others as a threat.
Mrs Fiona Steele, CBI's head of technology and innovation policy, said the
survey showed that UK companies saw an increasing competitive threat from EC
and other UK companies, rather than from Japan and the US. She cautioned,
however, that the survey was intended to identify trends rather than
absolute values.
The survey was carried out in October and November and follows a more
limited pilot study of trends in 1989. It is sponsored for five years by
National Westminster Bank's technology unit.

FT  23 APR 91 / Iraq accused of holding Kuwaitis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT accused Iraq yesterday of continuing to hold more than 5,400 Kuwaiti
civilians and soldiers and of failing to return stolen property, as required
by a United Nations Security Council resolution.
The Kuwaiti ambassador to the UN, Mr Mohammad Abol Hassan, wrote to the
Council saying that Baghdad's failure to adhere to Security Council
resolution 686 'puts the credibility and motives of the Iraqi regime under
suspicion'.
In accepting the resolution, adopted two days after the end of the Gulf war,
Baghdad had pledged to carry it out 'swiftly and honestly'.
The regime of president Saddam Hussein has said it accepts all Security
Council resolutions adopted since the invasion of Kuwait, including two that
impose financial liability on Iraq. But Baghdad has not explicitly announced
that it accepts liability and will pay damages.
The letter also complained that Iraq has failed to begin returning goods it
plundered from Kuwait during the seven-month occupation. Iraq has agreed to
return gold, currency, Kuwait Airways aircraft and museum collections and
antiquities.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, said yesterday during a visit to
Kuwait that he had received assurances from the Emir that human rights
abuses against minorities in the country had ceased.
He said that Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah had conceded during talks that there had
been some human rights abuses in the days after liberation and that the Emir
'made it clear the extent to which the government of Kuwait regrets that'.
Mr Baker said that Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the prime minister, and the Emir
had told him that they would be 'pleased to invite human rights
organisations to interview minorities - Palestinians and others'.
Amnesty International, the human rights group, said in a report last week
that there had been many substantiated cases of abuse against Palestinians
by Kuwaitis since the liberation and that there was evidence that such
abuses continued.
Only hours before Mr Baker's arrival, the Kuwaiti government refused
permission for opposition groups to hold a news conference and ordered the
lights to be turned off in a Kuwait City hotel ballroom where the event was
to be held.
Opposition figures said that the incident showed that the ruling al-Sabah
family was not sincere about allowing greater democracy and free speech.

FT  23 APR 91 / Moscow looks to Ecu for trade fillip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOVIET UNION is to discuss today with three of Europe's leading banks a
payments system that could ease trade among the former communist nations of
eastern Europe and help them to move to a free-market economy.
Officials from Gosbank, the Soviet central bank, are meeting in Turin to
talk about the concept with representatives of Deutsche Bank of Germany,
Credit Lyonnais of France and San Paolo Bank of Italy. These three groups
have indicated general support for the idea, possibly through establishing
lines of credit.
The state banks of Poland, Czechoslavakia and Hungary are also to be
represented at the meeting. An official from the European Commission, which
may support the venture financially, is taking part.
The system under discussion would use the Ecu, a basket of the main west
European currencies, as a common financial unit in settling transactions
between banks in eastern Europe that arise from trade payments.
It would replace the system formerly used in eastern Europe for trade-based
banking settlements, which was based on the transferable rouble.
The transferable rouble was abolished earlier this year as part of the
process of adopting western-style economic thinking in the former
communist-bloc nations. Since then, trade among the countries in the region
has been hit due to the lack of an alternative payments procedure.
The Ecu-based system could start in about a year, assuming planning proceeds
smoothly. It would use computers and financial procedures based on an
existing Ecu payments-clearing system.
It is thought that initially the east European venture would administer a
far smaller total of transactions, involving about 15 commercial banks in
eastern Europe. Later, it could be extended to incorporate transactions
involving banks in western Europe, so bolstering trade between the eastern
and western parts of the continent.
According to one idea under discussion, the system could be run by a
consortium of east European commercial banks, possibly with help from
western partners.
Representatives from four commercial banks from the former communist states
have indicated an interest in this idea and are attending the Turin meeting.
The banks are the International Bank for Economic Co-operation of the Soviet
Union; Investicni Banka of Czechoslovakia; the Inter Europa Bank of Hungary;
and Poland's State Savings Bank. Setting up the system would cost about
Ecu1m.
The meeting in Turin has been initiated by the Ecu Banking Association, a
group of European banks. Mr Dominique Rambure, chairman of the association
and a senior executive at San Paolo Bank, said: 'The system would be a step
in the right direction of getting eastern Europe away from centralised
economic planning.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Tesco chairman's earnings top Pounds 1.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, the grocery chain, received total
remuneration of Pounds 1.48m last year, representing a steep increase on his
previous year's basic pay of Pounds 345,000.
The pay of the chairman of Britain's second-biggest food retailing chain
advanced by Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 390,000. In addition, however, he
received a substantial boost from the inclusion of Pounds 1.09m in
performance-related incentive payments.
The payments related to a scheme introduced in 1988 which linked directors'
bonuses to the performance of the company's earnings per share. Over the
three-year period, Tesco's earnings per share rose by 71 per cent.
Four of Tesco's other executive directors benefited strongly from the
incentive scheme. Last year, one earned over Pounds 610,000, another more
than Pounds 665,000, and two are bracketed in the Pounds 785,000 to Pounds
790,000 pay range.
In total, the amount paid out to all directors in the year to February 23,
1991, increased from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 6.74m. Next year, however, the
directors will receive only Pounds 1.8m between them under the incentive
scheme as opposed to the accumulated three-year total of Pounds 4.33m they
received last year.
The growth in Sir Ian's remuneration follows a series of big rises for
senior executives at a number of the UK's largest companies.

FT  23 APR 91 / Labour's pay plans suffer further blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR party plans to reform wage bargaining were dealt a further blow
yesterday when the AEU engineering union rejected a second attempt in two
weeks by the Trades Union Congress to resolve inter-union differences on the
issue.
The decision of the executive of the the AEU, the UK's fourth-largest union,
illustrates difficulties faced by the Labour movement in formulating a
consensus on plans to create a national minimum wage and hold a yearly
national economic assessment.
Such an assessment, in which a Labour government, unions and employers would
take part, would be used to set a national minimum wage. The two policies
form the centre-piece of Labour's plans to reform wage bargaining.
Failure to find a meaningful compromise could leave the Labour party open to
charges that it and the unions have not resolved the pay-bargaining
difficulties that helped to topple the last Labour administration in 1979.
AEU objections to the plans of the TUC and the Labour party are especially
damaging because the union is one of the more moderate, and normally among
the party's most loyal supporters.
The AEU executive decided it could not accept a redraft of a TUC paper in
which unions were asked to agree that, in pay talks for higher-paid workers
under a Labour government, they would not cite any rise in the proposed
national minimum wage.
The wording has changed from the previous draft, which said unions would
disregard the minimum wage in talks on other pay levels. AEU members fear
the new version still implies an unacceptable erosion of wage differentials.
AEU representatives will press at the TUC general council tomorrow for
further changes, although some executive members believe the clause should
be removed.
The union, which supports a national minimum wage, will also seek amendments
to other parts of the document to emphasise further the rejection by unions
of any form of wage restraint. Mr Bill Jordan, AEU president, said
suggestions that skilled workers' pay should be held down were 'not only
economic madness, but will be implemented over this union's dead body'.
He said the Labour movement needed to study the issue further. Failure to do
so might lead to a dangerous diversion from Labour's central objective of
regaining power.

FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: Why company well-being is a priority for banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PH NUNNERLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As you would expect I totally disagree with the letter from Jeremy
Parker (April 15) suggesting the clearing banks were often too tardy in
helping ailing companies.
We currently have some 400,000 small business customers on our books and are
deeply committed to ensuring that our customers' well-being is a top
priority - it has to be in order to guarantee our own future as a viable
company.
Mr Parker chides us for not using our 'early warning systems' to detect the
first signs of decline in the quality of security. In many respects we are
largely in the hands of the companies themselves - in a recession the most
ominous sign to a good bank manager can be the total lack of contact with a
business customer.
As one of my branch managers in central London put it recently: 'It's when I
don't hear from customers that I start to worry.' That said, there are many
forms of assistance we can and do give - and we constantly remind customers
to come to their bank manager at the first signs of problems. Peremptory
calling in of borrowing may only lose the bank both its investment and its
customers.

FT  23 APR 91 / Passage from India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Indians massacre villagers', read the headline over a short news item from
my colleague David House-go yesterday. His report, detailing the actions of
Indian security forces in Kashmir, came as a salutary reminder of the
internecine strife, government indecision and financial crises that threaten
the world's most populous democracy. We who watch from afar have naturally
been transfixed by events in the Gulf and the slow disintegration of the
Soviet Union; meanwhile the outlook for India becomes more uncertain.
Kashmir, the only one of India's 25 states with a Moslem majority, is being
held within the republic by military force. In the Punjab a Sikh uprising by
proponents of an independent 'Khalistan' - note how like Kurdistan it sounds
 -appears to be continuing. This is complicated by divisions among the Sikhs
themselves. Militancy has been met with brutality. The slaughter of
innocents by terrorists is evident. Yet the grievances endure; the ideal of
Khalistan will persist even if modified by events. There is also a
continuing undercurrent of revolt in Assam, in the north-east, while in the
enchanting southern state of Tamil Nadu the Tamil Tigers take their
recreation leave from fighting in Sri Lanka by imposing their own will on
parts of their home ground. Clearly the peaceful democracy so well espoused
in London salons by the late Mr Jawaharlal Nehru is not working as well as
it should.
This is hardly surprising. The US has cohesion because its original
settlers, who were overwhelmingly from the British Isles or German-speaking
parts of Europe, created a melting-pot into which later arrivals have to be
poured. It works, if imperfectly. But imagine a federated Europe, stretching
from the Atlantic to the Urals and Stockholm to Naples, in which the Germans
predominated and their language and that of a departed army of
Hindi-speaking conquerors were the two official media of government and
business. In the long run it would not work.
Perhaps what we are seeing in India today is the beginning of the end of the
long run. There was no Indian state before the British created its political
boundaries. The legacy of the Raj was picked up by an educated elite wedded
to the notion of a socialist, secular, permanently unified state. The older
members of this elite still retain England - its language, history and
culture - in their heads; their children less so. The more ambitious among
the governing classes still entertain visions of India's grandeur as the
leader of the non-aligned nations, a senior player upon the world stage,
even a nuclear power.
Reality is eating away at the ideas of Mr Nehru and the founding fathers.
Socialism is increasingly out of fashion in most parts of the world, perhaps
puzzlingly so to some Indians. (There are two Communist parties, which
together have 56 seats in the country's 524-member lower house of
parliament.) Yet for the election due next month Mr Rajiv Gandhi, inheritor
of the leadership of the founding Congress party, is fighting on a manifesto
that promises both a programme of privatisation and a cut in government
spending.
It is hard to maintain the secular ideal. The revivalist Bharatiya Janata
Party, BJP, trades upon the paradoxical feelings among Hindus that although
they are the overwhelming majority they are somehow threatened by Moslems,
Sikhs, and other minorities. This reaches deep into the psyche of many
Hindus. Indian acquaintances of wide erudition and a cosmopolitan mien have
confided to me that they see a point in BJP's proposal to construct a Hindu
temple on a site claimed by Moslems. Mr Gandhi needs Moslem votes and cannot
play the Hindu card, but he has offered a compromise on job reservation for
lower castes, offering to support a scheme without giving figures.
As to national unity and international status, post-war Indian foreign
policy has been firmly based on cementing a special relationship with the
Soviet Union. But now we live in a one-superpower world, and any outside
acquiescence in bloody attempts to repress secessionist movements will
depend upon the US. There is not much point in being non-aligned if there is
no balance of power within which not to align yourself. During the Gulf war
India managed to offend almost every party - its old friends, the Iraqis, by
doing nothing, and its potential business partners, the Americans, by
cutting off overflying rights to refuel at Bombay.
It will be difficult to mend such broken fences until the election produces
a new government, probably a coalition, possibly led by Mr Gandhi. The first
step, however, will be to produce a budget, postponed for electoral reasons,
and the step after that will be to sit down with India's creditors. This is
where outsiders, like the IMF and the World Bank, have some leverage. They
will not provide cash without strings. But how far should conditionality go?
It is in everyone's interest to strengthen Indian democracy, and - as the
Gulf war and its aftermath show - it is the prevailing fashion to maintain
existing boundaries however colonialist their origins. But Indians are
independent-minded people. They need not follow fashion. They would be wise
at least to loosen their tight republic and replace it with a true
federation, or, better, confederation - in short, to decentralise
administration outwards and far away from Delhi.
The new government should state its intentions about economic
liberalisation, and clear its mind about whether it welcomes inward
investment or seeks to drive it away by the sheer weight of obstructive
bureaucracy. I have anecdotal evidence about an Indian mega-millionaire who
made his money in the US and wanted to invest Dollars 250m back home but
withdrew after three months of frustrated attempts to meet the demands of
the Indian civil service. There is a huge wealth of talent and drive among
India's 850m people. They need to shed the remaining burden of the Raj, even
take the risk that in the end some of them go their separate ways, if they
are to realise their potential.

FT  23 APR 91 / Into the air with a hold full of hopes: Martin Dickson on
the outlook for the US aircraft maker McDonnell Douglas as it tries to
recover from a succession of blows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three sleek new airliners, their fresh paint glinting in the spring
Californian sunshine, sit on the 'flight ramp' - the very end of the
production line at McDonnell Douglas's Long Beach plant - surrounded by a
clutter of equipment as workers prepare the jets for final delivery.
They are among the first dozen production models of a wide-bodied,
three-engined jet - the MD-11 - to roll off the commercial aircraft line. To
McDonnell Douglas, these jets, and 34 other MD-11s due for delivery this
year, represent much more than routine aircraft sales. To the management at
Long Beach, where McDonnell makes its civilian aircraft, they provide hope
that the chronic problems that have plagued the plant for years are being
solved. And at the group's headquarters in St Louis, Missouri, the sales are
a kind of financial poetry in motion: each departing Dollars 100m (Pounds
55.8m) jet brings in huge amounts of cash flow which the company believes
will extricate it from a tight corner by the end of this year.
For McDonnell Douglas, the largest defence contractor in the US and one of
the western world's three leading civilian aircraft manufacturers, has a
stretched balance sheet. In 1990 much more cash - some Dollars 400m - flowed
out of the business than came in.
Ironically, just when the company has been basking in the success of its
weapons systems in the Gulf war, a succession of blows has left some
Pentagon officials and industry observers questioning whether it could even
become a contender for bankruptcy or a government bail-out.
Mr John McDonnell, the company's bearded, 53-year-old chairman and the son
of its founder, says the Cassandras are just plain wrong. 'We've taken a lot
of strong measures to improve cash flow and they are taking effect,' he
says. 'By the end of this year our cash flow will be getting quite positive
and our debt will be going down, and it will be obvious to everyone that
we're getting in a much stronger financial situation.'
But in 1990 the company reported net earnings of only Dollars 306m on
revenues of Dollars 16bn, while at year-end its debts, excluding its
financing arm, totalled Dollars 3bn, or 95 per cent of its equity. Nor is
the quality of its earnings very impressive: some Dollars 376m of 1990
profits came from a one-time pensions settlement, while the company is in
dispute with the government over military contracts which could eventually
mean writing off hundreds of millions of dollars.
The most serious dispute stems from January's decision by Mr Dick Cheney,
the US defence secretary, to cancel development of the A-12 attack aircraft,
a potential Dollars 50bn programme being jointly developed by McDonnell
Douglas and General Dynamics. The two contractors, having already taken
large write-offs on the A-12, are now locked in litigation over Dollars
1.3bn of progress payments which the Pentagon wants back.
Even if McDonnell's finances are now improving, with a reported profit of
Dollars 58m for the three months to March 31 this year, against only Dollars
2m for a year earlier, it faces a difficult long-term juggling act: its
combat aircraft business, which for years has made up for the weak financial
performance of the commercial side, is shrinking inexorably as the US cuts
its defence budget.
The Gulf war is unlikely to bring in much fresh business - apart from a
replenishment of the Tomahawk cruise missiles. And while McDonnell remains
the leading US manufacturer of combat aircraft, several models - the F-15
Eagle, the Harrier II AV-8B and the Apache helicopter - are nearing the end
of their Pentagon production programmes.
An announcement is expected today on the air force's choice to succeed the
F-15. The contenders are a Northrop-McDonnell partnership and one comprising
Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics. Worth Dollars 64.6bn, according to
the Pentagon, the contract for the advanced tactical fighter, the ATF, is
vital to McDonnell Douglas. This month it lost out to a rival
Boeing-Sikorsky consortium for the US army's new light attack helicopter
contract.
Whichever way the ATF contest is decided, it is clear that McDonnell's
future is becoming more dependent on Long Beach and its ability to develop
profitably new generations of civilian aircraft in competition against the
larger, more efficient Boeing and European Airbus Industrie.
Long Beach, in common with rival manufacturers, has a strong order-book  -
particularly for wide-bodied jets - though in recent months the industry has
become nervous because of deferrals and cancellations by airline customers.
But the plant has been an Achilles heel since the Californian Douglas
company merged with McDonnell in 1967, losing money for much of the past 15
years.
Its profits record might be blamed in part on the competitive pressures of
the aerospace industry, but insiders suggest it results substantially from
years of poor productivity and lack of discipline. The plant's management
did not have a sufficient grasp on real production costs, while suppliers
complained about bureaucracy and inefficiency in the purchasing system.
All these problems were exacerbated in the mid-1980s as Long Beach tried to
cope not only with making the aircraft it already had in production - the
MD-80 twin-engine jet and the now discontinued DC-10 wide-bodied aircraft -
but also with a rush of new developments: there was the MD-11, the successor
to the DC-10; the MD-90, a follow-on from the MD-80; the C-17, a new
generation of military transport aircraft specially designed for use on
short runways; and the T45, a naval training aircraft.
Despite these new ventures, McDonnell Douglas's family of commercial
aircraft is less comprehensive than that of Boeing and the developing Airbus
fleet. Unlike its two principal competitors, it has no presence in the
middle range of the market, but is concentrated at the lower end, with the
MD-80, and at the top with the MD-11. McDonnell and Airbus missed a chance
to challenge Boeing two years ago by failing to agree to co-operate on new
aircraft production. Now McDonnell is understood to be actively looking for
an equity partner to buy a minority stake in the commercial jet side of the
business.
Meanwhile, as the company struggled to meet its commercial aircraft
commitments and programmes, staff levels were rising. At Long Beach, the
workforce went from just 12,000 in 1982 to 52,000 in 1989. As it did the
experience level of the average worker dropped from 10 years to two.
Problems multiplied and the plant's development schedule lagged.
At this point Mr McDonnell, who became chairman in early 1988, decided that
the entire group needed a radical overhaul of its management systems. A new
executive team, drawn from across the company, was despatched to Long Beach
last year, headed by Mr Bob Hood. The new management approach aims to
improve productivity and customer satisfaction by stripping away
bureaucracy, pushing greater powers of decision-making down the line, and
creating greater motivation and inter-departmental co-operation through the
formation of teams. Called Total Quality Management System (TQMS), and
inspired by the Japanese, it has been adopted by several other leading US
manufacturers.
'We started from ground zero,' recalls Mr Hood. Departments were reshaped
into teams working on individual products, drawing together people from
different disciplines. Management layers were cut from nine to five and the
new leaders were selected with an emphasis on what Mr Hood calls their
ability to 'coach and listen' rather than 'old-style dictatorial
management'.
Over the longer term, the changes may well prove to be the salvation of Long
Beach. In the short term, they produced more confusion, demoralisation and
delays. TQMS was introduced gradually and quite successfully at McDonnell's
St Louis division, but was imposed virtually overnight at Long Beach.
Matters became so bad that Colonel Kenneth Tollefson, the air force
representative overseeing the C-17 programme, wrote an article in the staff
newspaper accusing management of lack of leadership.
Morale at the plant still seems shaky, and union relations delicate, but
over the past year progress on the MD-80 and MD-11 lines does suggest that
the shake-up is starting to produce better results. For example,
productivity on the MD-80 improved by more than 30 per cent in 1990 and is
still getting better. For the first time in its history that aircraft has
enjoyed two consecutive money-making quarters, with a third coming up.
All this has not saved the MD-11 from some recent embarrassing criticism
from Mr Robert Crandall, the chairman of American Airlines, who was unhappy
with the first aircraft delivered to his company. Mr Crandall's complaints
seem to involve some easily fixable and relatively minor glitches, and
American says the problems do not alter its enthusiasm for the MD-11.
A far larger Long Beach dispute, which could have a significant impact on
the group's profits and balance sheet, concerns the C-17, which is behind
schedule and looks likely to come in over the Dollars 6.6bn fixed-price
contract McDonnell Douglas accepted from the air force. The air force,
claiming that McDonnell is Dollars 500m above the ceiling, withheld progress
payments late last year and Pentagon officials were recently quoted as
saying that the project might now be Dollars 800m to Dollars 900m over
budget.
McDonnell, however, reckons the aircraft will come in only Dollars 100m
above the ceiling. Mr Herb Lanese, the company's senior vice-president,
finance, says the two sides are working on new figures and insists that 'the
performance indicators at this time are a lot closer to our numbers than to
the air force's'.
The Pentagon's withholding of Dollars 900m last year for work on the C-17
and the cancelled A-12 has contributed significantly to McDonnell's cash
squeeze, as has the tightness of the capital markets, restricting cheap
access to funds for a company with a low investment-grade credit rating. But
the main factor has been the Dollars 3bn cost of developing the MD-11 -
roughly the same as the group's entire equity base.
However, Mr Lanese says the financial picture is on the point of improving
substantially and that March probably saw the peak of the company's
borrowing needs. At the end of the first quarter McDonnell's debt totalled
about Dollars 3.3bn, with some Dollars 370m of cash on hand, against net
equity of Dollars 3.5bn. With loan covenants setting a ceiling of just over
Dollars 4bn on total borrowings, the company still has a sizeable ability to
raise funds.
The improving cash position is due in part to MD-11 sales but also to a
company-wide savings drive: working capital is being slashed, the dividend
has been reduced and capital spending curtailed. The MD-11 production
schedule has also been cut - by five aircraft this year, from 42 to 37,
helping save on parts and labour costs.
All this does suggest that the direst predictions are overdone. That said,
McDonnell's room for manoeuvre will remain tight for the rest of this year,
and there are several wild cards - a Dollars 500m tax claim, the C-17 and
labour issues - which could yet cause it severe headaches.
Next year cash flow is likely to turn positive, but the heat will still be
on McDonnell's management: to improve Long Beach productivity; to find funds
to develop the next wide-bodied jet - a stretched version of the MD-11
called the MD-12X which will compete with the Boeing 747-400; and to handle
the tricky transfer of resources from fighter to commercial aircraft.

FT  23 APR 91 / Leading Article: Listening to employees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE seeking a lesson in the most productive ways to manage workers would
be unlikely to look first to Britain. Failure to engage the skills and
commitment of workers effectively has been a longstanding problem for
industry. In the 1970s, the symptom of this British disease was industrial
action. In the 1990s, it is unemployment caused by inability to contain wage
growth.
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, nonetheless believes Britain
has a story to tell. He yesterday praised companies for promoting employee
involvement. Instead of following rigid European practice, companies were
finding their own ways of raising productivity through worker involvement.
Mr Howard's point is that British companies are already addressing this
tricky issue without having to be forced to do so by the European
Commission. He suggested that the Council of Ministers accepts a vaguely
worded endorsement of worker participation in place of the Commission's
draft directive on European works councils. This would avoid large employers
having to establish European consultation mechanisms.
Part of Mr Howard's motive was no doubt political. The government has played
on its resistance to what it regards as the Commission's plan to smother the
Single European Market in the red tape of the social action programme. Mr
John Major has less taste for such public carping than Mrs Thatcher, but Mr
Howard believes he is on firm ground, given the undoubted hostility of
British employers to the draft directive.
Overblown rhetoric
The political motivation accounts for some of the overblown rhetoric.
Companies employing more than 1,000 people and more than 100 in at least two
EC countries would no doubt find it irritating to have to pay for regular
pan-European briefing meetings. Many might question their value, but the
directive would hardly force them into full-blown co-determination.
One reason why the fears appear exaggerated is the long history of the
directive. It is a descendant of more ambitious attempts to impose worker
participation, including the Vredeling directive of 1980. But its roots are
misleading: the European Commission no longer sees itself applying the
German model across the Community. Most of today's debate revolves around
the entirely valid objective of increasing managerial effectiveness and
corporate success.
Code of practice
Mr Howard could do more to catch this mood. For example a code of practice
on employee involvement has already been drawn up by the Institute of
Personnel Management and the Involvement and Participation Association. Mr
Howard should consider endorsing it.
But such signals of encouragement to employee involvement are the limit of
what governments should do. Legislation is not the right way to define or
enforce good management practice. This is as true of employee communication
as it is of the structure of company boards or the planning of a production
line. Inflexible models of how managers should inform workers will not
increase good communication.
Much of this legislative intent at the European level is, in any case,
clearly outdated. Not only European governments, but US management
consultants now preach the virtues of involving employees in production
systems and quality control; wise managements keep workers informed and
listen to what they say. Japanese team-working methods and quality circles
are among the clearest pieces of evidence that worker involvement can bring
a financial pay-off.
The market is thus already deciding in favour of involvement. Changes in
working methods to suit more complex production processes are already making
it more difficult to sustain a clear divide between managers and the
managed. This is something for governments to encourage if they want to
achieve economic success. It cannot be imposed through inflexible
legislation, no matter how well intentioned.

FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Snowy wastes focus the mind - William Packer on the
Canadian exhibition at the Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The True North is the self-consciously evocative, not to say portentous
title of the exhibition that now fills the upper tier of the Barbican Art
Gallery (until June 16: sponsored by The Daily Telegraph and Air Canada).
But while its sub-title, 'Canadian landscape painting 1896 - 1939', might
well give us pause, with thoughts inevitable of something more frozen, dull
and provincial than exciting, for once the more hopeful expectation is not
disappointed. As is so often the case with national schools, Canadian
painting has been for far too long too well-kept a secret, to the general
loss. What the Barbican now offers us is quite simply, within its own terms,
as intriguing and physically enjoyable a show of well-made, honest paintings
as we could wish for.
The study of art is littered in paradox, not the least of them that which
suggests that the more national, even local the work might be, the wider its
general interest and significance. So steeped are we in the idea of Paris as
the very heart of modernism through all its earlier phases, that we too
easily accept that franco-centric reading at its own self-valuation, seeing
everything else as but second-hand, second-best and provincial. But, paradox
again, Paris was indeed at the heart of things, and artists came from across
the world to see and respond to what was being done, and measure their own
art by its standards.
The traffic was ever all ways, and in the first decades of this century many
of these expatriates clearly held much in common in that was quite distinct
from Paris. The more worldly and knowing, the more true to themselves they
were. The Canadians were no exception in this, but they might as well have
been Scots or Scandinavians, Spaniards or Mexicans, Americans or even
Japanese. The mistake was only to forget, or rather discount the fact that
artists went on working wherever they were, thinking of home when they were
in Paris, and quite often remembering Paris when they were home.
But while this question of national self-identity is common-place, it is
true that it has concerned Canadians to a peculiar degree. The looming,
over-bearing presence of the US, the sense of existing along a narrow
southern fringe with, at their back, the immense wilderness stretching
endlessly away to the Farthest North, has always concentrated their minds
wonderfully. In their artists it must surely account for the often
self-consciously exhortatory quality of their writings, urging each other
towards a position that is truly Canadian; for the constant groupings and
regroupings of clubs and societies; and above all, for the epic and
celebratory aspect of so much of the work in this exhibition. This last
especially is a quality held in common with certain of the contemporary
Scandinavian and Icelandic painters, but here so much more forceful and
intense.
The show begins with the work of the young artists who were in Paris well
before the turn of the century, where they they were able to respond
directly to impressionism in its later moods and phases, and to early
developments in post-impressionism. These are not the most dramatic images,
but their accomplishment and sophistication are incontestable, two views of
1906 by Maurice Cullen, across the St Lawrence river to and from Quebec, as
subtle and exquisite in their suggestive tonality as any Monet, and the most
beautiful in the entire show. Suzor-Cote, Clarence Gagnon and James Morrice,
make up this first most distinctive and distinguished group.
But the best known group, and indeed central to the whole study of Canadian
painting in the early 20th century, is the Group of Seven, which came
together informally in the 1910s and formally constituted itself just after
the Great War. With certain individual artists loosely associated with it,
such as Tom Thomson who died in 1917 and, much later, Emily Carr, it
addressed itself consciously to the landscape not merely as a visible
phenomenon, but as a moral force.
In the work of all the Seven: Harris, MacDonald, Lismer, Jackson, Varley,
Johnston and Carmichael, the landscape takes on an almost mystical presence,
not personal exactly but alive in its physicality, the space across the
lake, the form over the mountain febrile in definition, fraught with
feeling. Cloud, mountain, lake and forest alike are simplified and
celebrated almost as symbol and totem, the individual tree or rock itself
become a monument. But there is rather more to it than simple symbolic
signification. The works are beautifully painted, and with a raw but
contained energy in the drawing, and rich paint on the surface. Landscape,
image and experience alike are beautifully observed, realised and felt.
As much is true of the work of Tom Thomson, perhaps more so, which is as
impressive as anything here, though shown separately by the accident of his
early death. If the exhibition does nothing more than establish his wider
reputation, it will have been worthwhile.
The show is rounded off by the later work of those artists who continued, by
Emily Carr's overt symbolism, by younger artists such as Charles Comfort,
and by perhaps the most idiosyncratic and particular of them all, David
Milne, whose delicately mannered touch exquisitely combines any number of
modernisms, from impressionism on.
Back to the Seven for a moment, Arthur Lismer and Frederick Varley were both
from Sheffield and their work is the subject of a coincidental exhibition,
Our Home and Native Land, organised by the Sheffield City Art Galleries,
which comes to Canada House next month (May 3 to June 18). Showing them as
it does in depth, it is a necessary pendant to this Barbican exhibition.
Un-Natural Traces, which fills the Barbican's lower gallery, is a
complementary show of current Canadian art.

FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Robert Wilson's 'Night before the Day' - Paula Deitz
on the American director's latest presentation: a retrospective exhibition
of his work together with his new production, Ibsen's 'When we Dead Awaken'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULA DEITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Wilson, the theatre director, writer, designer and artist, was born
in Waco, Texas, lives in New York City, and has preferred to work in Berlin,
Paris and other cultural capitals of Europe. During the past season, though,
Boston and Cambridge have provided the artist, who will be 50 this year,
with two opportunities for world premieres that will travel across the
country. They mark a new stage in his career.
Wilson's stock-in-trade is to give concrete form to a combination of
visionary images and gestures gleaned from daily observation. Placed in a
theatrical, indeed operatic setting, these fragments are made to cohere by a
third ingredient - the attention and imagination of his audience.
In many ways, he is closer to Wagner than Ionesco, for though the absurd may
be buried in the material, it is the epic themes and variations,
repetitiously unfurled during long performances like those of Einstein on
the Beach, that shape the disjointed parts into a memorable whole. And even
where a performance may lag, there is the architecture of the set and his
painterly use of light that make the experience more than just a worthwhile
representation.
At the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Robert Wilson's Vision, the first
retrospective of the artist's work in a decade, is as much a performance as
an exhibition. And across the Charles River in Cambridge, the American
Repertory Theatre at Harvard premiered Wilson's production of Henrik Ibsen's
last play, When We Dead Awaken, which will now be moving with the exhibition
to Houston, Texas, and, one would hope, to other cities here and abroad.
As is often the case, an outside discipline can channel creativity into
unusual depths, and here an 1899 play (Wilson usually writes his own
scripts), whose symbolist themes are compatible with Wilson's techniques,
has given the director a chance to cut loose in amazing ways. Not the least
of these are the inclusion of some hauntingly beautiful blues songs,
composed and sung by tap dancer Charles 'Honi' Coles, sometimes with the
whole cast, during the 'Knee Plays', the brief performances in the intervals
that are the joints between the acts. Both the exhibition and the play are
accompanied by sound environments composed by Wilson's longtime
collaborator, Hans Peter Kuhn.
In designing the exhibition, a work of installation art in itself, Wilson
created a journey through three major galleries that, like any classical
drama, suggests the passage of a single day. 'The Night before the Day,' as
he calls the installation, features objects and furniture used as props,
drawings, paintings, maquettes and actual sets from his past productions.
The entrance through a long dark corridor sounds like a wind tunnel with
distant bird calls and leads to a room the colour of dawn, where, among
other objects, his hanging wire mesh chairs and tables are doubled by their
perfect shadows on the walls. Such objects as the Japanese-style puppets,
used in 'Knee Plays' during CIVIL WarS, and the glass and neon light bulb
from Death Destruction and Detroit are elegant in themselves though somehow
denuded of their active stage roles.
More illuminating are the black-and-white drawings of his stage designs that
convey with solid and luminously transparent planes the great sense of stage
distance he achieves. One drawing, for 'A Letter for Queen Victoria,'
demonstrates how something as simple as the back of an envelope can inspire
the diagonals of his stage design. The final gallery, dark as night, is
aglow with the moving lights of the grid - like the interior of the
spaceship from the climax of Einstein on the Beach: being so close to it
fulfils an audience fantasy of wanting to be in it.
Having recently seen a more traditional production of When We Dead Awaken
performed by the Jean Cocteau Repertory in New York, I am convinced that
Wilson has given a more thoughtful and penetrating interpretation of this
enigmatic play, which Ibsen saw as the epilogue of his previous works. The
new translation is by Robert Brustein, the ART's artistic director.
Rubek, the famous but ageing sculptor who attempts to rekindle his creative
spark, rejects his young, earthy but boring wife, Maya, for a kind of
spiritual meeting with the model, Irene, who inspired his greatest work and
who may or may not be alive. The sets of mountainous seaside scenes, with
rivers of glass and glacial peaks are realistic enough and make one sense
the starkness of the terrain. The 'music' of clanking metal and roaring sea
evokes a desolate landscape as well. But the constructions, as of a metal
cage cum labyrinth where Irene and her keeper, here her inner self, take
interminable walks, add to the psychological force of the dialogue.
The sets and costumes recall the sombre beauty of 19th-century Scandinavian
landscape and figure painting. Wilson has hewed to the force of the script
and each act takes his audience higher into the mountains in a natural
ascent to the fatal avalanche. The line from Charles 'Honi' Coles' first
song - 'I was alone when I met her/ Now I wish I was alone' - becomes a good
refrain for the play.
When We Dead Awaken will be presented by the Alley Theatre in Houston,
Texas, May 22 - May 26. Robert Wilson's Vision will go on exhibit in Houston
at the Contemporary Arts Museum, June 15 - August 18 and at the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art, September 12 - December 1. AT&amp;T is the
corporate sponsor.

FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Prokofiev symphonies - Royal Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most interesting features of the current 'Russian Spring' series
on South Bank is the programming on two weekends of all seven Prokofiev
symphonies. This is much rarer than it ought to be; and even individually,
the fortunes of the symphonies are mixed - the First ('Classical') and Fifth
are played a lot, the Sixth slightly less often, and the remaining four very
little.
In addition, the chance to hear the seven given in chronological order, as
the two BBC Philharmonic weekends allow, tells one a great deal not only
about the development of an important composer, but much that is central to
the whole notion of a 'Russian Spring' in music. For, while Prokofiev may
not have been a revolutionary composer in any committed ideological sense,
it is in his brilliant, audacious, and copious musical outpourings that we
come to appreciate most fully the trends of the immediate pre and
post-Revolutionary period.
The BBC Philharmonic under Edward Downes played the 'Classical' and the
Second on Saturday evening (separated by Nikolay Demidenko's superlatively
fine account, technically impeccable, formidable, sparklingly witty, of the
First Piano Concerto) and the Third and Fourth on Sunday afternoon (the rest
follow, in similar programme divisions and timings, next weekend). The
'Classical' (1916-17) is a jeu d'esprit indicative of the saucy wit and love
of 18th-century forms and counterpoint that would stamp Prokofiev all his
life. But from there to the Second is a big, fascinating step; and under
Downes's sympathetic and knowledgeable guidance it was rewarding to be able
to take it.
The following three works, all scored for gigantic forces, are stepchildren
of the repertory; the Second (1924-5), a piece of steel-and-smoke musical
machinery unparalleled in Prokofiev's output, is the most neglected and
misunderstood of the trio - unsuccessful at its Paris premiere, apt to be
dismissively viewed even now.
The title of Mossolov's notorious short ballet, Iron Foundry, could with
some aptness serve as its subtitle, though in the second movement, a set of
theme and variations, there is relief, of a quietly and mysteriously
beautiful kind, from the pounding, braying and chains of dissonances (all of
which Downes and his orchestra clarified with masterly patience).
The Second is not exactly a decorous or tidy piece of symphonic construction
(Prokofiev never got round to revising or re-scoring it, as he planned). But
in a carefully considered performance such as we heard on Saturday, the
wealth of combative, rhythmically intricate, densely vibrant material it
contains can knock an audience sideways.
The next two symphonies gained their existence via a different route: both
are re-thinkings of existent material, the one operatic, the other balletic,
and so it is understandable that both, while no less thunderous at climaxes,
should be cleaner and trimmer in their proportions. And both, in their
different and more mature ways, seem to mark the most artistically striking
point of balance between the 'iconoclastic' Prokofiev and the 'popular'.
Both contain extraordinarily rich and exciting invention: their blends of
sounds and harmonies - intense, pungent, and sweepingly lyrical by turns -
are like no other I know. The Third (1928) is the symphony that Prokofiev
drew from the opera The Fiery Angel (which Downes will be conducting - happy
news] - at Covent Garden in two seasons' time); the Fourth (1929-30, revised
1947) is an adaptation and extension of material from the ballet The
Prodigal Son.
Whether or not Prokofiev was a symphonist in the traditionally understood
sense is a question that has been hotly debated before, and will no doubt be
again; but it seems to me that, particularly in the Third, with its
depiction of worlds earthly and demonic, of states of mind 'normal' and
wildly out of kilter, a discourse of confronted opposites is very much in
the fabric of its four movements. While the Fourth does not grip the
listener in quite the same way, the diversity of its sound-worlds -
comic-pastoral, sparkishly jazzy, and broadly melodic - is even more
immediate in its appeal.
I formed the impression, perhaps unjustly, that of all the works on the bill
of the first BBCPO weekend, the Fourth had been the one least precisely
prepared. There were patches of scrappy ensemble, and it was here that one
noticed most often the orchestra's relative narrowness of string tone (the
brass played expertly throughout). But in Downes's hands, lack of orchestral
inflation was an interpretative feature, and a wholly positive one, of both
concerts: while performances of more extravagantly virtuosic, or 'Russian',
characterisation are easily imagined, those of more musicianly style and
substance can hardly be. On to next weekend]

No generation in English history had more influence on the way we lead our
lives today than those who lived in the first half of the 17th century. From
the winning of the initiative by the House of Commons via the civil war,
with the defeat and execution of the king in 1649, to the Cromwellian
Commonwealth, it was a period packed with crucial incident.
It can be argued that it was the earliness of their 'revolution' which gave
the English such a stable constitutional life for the next 300 years.
Channel 4 starts a 6-part series on England's Civil War (8.30).
ITV starts a second series of the entertaining drama Chancer (9.00) about
the cockney yuppie Stephen Crane. BBC2 begins a six-part documentary series
about the British experience of sex in the first half of this century: A
Secret World Of Sex (9.50). Under the Mental Defectives Act of 1913 young
women could be locked away in mental homes if they had illegitimate babies,
and for many the annual seaside holiday was one of the few opportunities for
sexual activity.

FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Sleepy Commons takes on funereal
atmosphere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIME-time debate in the Commons on the funeral industry is not a normal
feature of parliamentary life. Coupled with rumours, which began immediately
MPs reassembled after a fortnight's Easter recess, of a two-week break at
Whitsun, it produced a feeling at Westminster that the session had
effectively turned up its toes.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, is quick to dispel such ideas.
Parliament is dealing with more bills this session than in both the two
previous years, he says, and the government is carrying through a heavy
legislative programme. Yesterday's debate was a routine occasion for a
backbencher's choice of subject.
Mr MacGregor points out that so far 34 bills have been launched in the
1990-91 session, compared with 26 in the 1989-90 period and 30 the year
before.
In terms of controversy and length, the picture is slightly different.
The Commons will indeed be disposing of four bills this week, but
discussions on bills dealing with Scottish natural heritage and the atomic
weapons establishment are unlikely to attract full houses.
Every year has some politically inconsequential measures, such as the
Overseas Superannuation Bill which the Commons passed almost without
noticing, but most sessions have blockbusters as well.
Only the Criminal Justice Bill this year is comparable with heavyweights
such as last year's legislation on broadcasting, environmental issues and
health service reforms.
Alongside the deliberate pre-election mix of bills, MPs are also benefiting
from Mr MacGregor's positive management of the programme.
In refusing to allow his colleagues to hijack bills and expand them to
overflow the time provided, and in creating special committees to leave most
European Community legislation to the enthusiasts, he has lightened two
traditional scourges of backbenchers in search of more time with their
families.
Outside factors have also helped. Ministers mention MPs' pre-occupation with
the Gulf, and with local government elections and finance. The most
effective distraction, however, was the one that dares not speak its name -
the Tory leadership contest in November.
While the Tory party went through the most dramatic political events in most
politicians' memories, in just a fortnight, the Commons went through all
stages of three bills and the second readings of five others.
Even after Mrs Thatcher's departure, politics continued to dominate over
government. It would not have been the way of expediting legislation that
the government would have chosen, but it certainly worked.
Its effect has been to end the business managers' annual nightmare of ranks
of MPs increasingly bad-tempered and tied to Westminster by three-line whips
through long, hot July evenings.
Instead, in order to avoid both the opposite trap of devilish work being
found for idle hands and the charge of running out of steam, ministers are
emphasising the amount of business still to be done.
They acknowledge privately, however, that MPs have largely lost interest in
legislation, with the possible exception of the Finance Bill. 'They're just
looking to the election now,' said one cabinet minister.

FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Chalker to press United Nations to
play much more active role - Kurdish refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to press the United Nations to inject a greater sense of urgency
into the direction of its relief programme for the Iraqi refugees on the
Turkish border and in Iran.
Mrs Lynda Chalker, minister for overseas development, clearly shocked by the
'horrendous' conditions she saw for herself at the end of last week, is to
make urgent representations at the UN headquarters in New York.
She will see Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary general, today. Mr
Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister of state, will have parallel talks in
Geneva with Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the UN delegate in charge of the
refugee programme in Iraq and Kuwait.
Mrs Chalker warned the Commons yesterday that the role of British troops in
creating safe havens for the Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq would extend
over 'several months'. She called on the UN to play 'a much more active role
right away'.
She made it clear that, if necessary, she would go beyond normal diplomatic
niceties to ensure that Mr Perez de Cuellar was in no doubt about Britain's
concern.
Mrs Chalker, who acknowledged that local UN representatives were making
strenuous efforts, stressed: 'It is at the centre and the top where me must
get things sorted out.'
Describing the plight of the Iraqi refugees as 'truly harrowing' she said
the assistance being provided was greater for those on the Turkish border
than for those in Iran.
She announced that Britain would make an initial contribution of Pounds 2m
to help the refugees in Iran, from the Pounds 20m programme pledged by Mr
John Major, the prime minister.
Britain wants the UN and other international agencies to join in a drive to
at least double the rate of delivery of supplies for the refugees.
MRS CHALKER rejected Labour charges that she had been wrong to link efforts
to secure the release of British hostages held in the Lebanon with the
provision of aid for the refugees.
She insisted she had not linked the two issues, but claimed she would have
been open to criticism if she had not referred to Britain's anxiety to
secure the hostages' earliest possible release.

FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Full circle for Thatcher's nemesis
 -Philip Stephens on Michael Heseltine's replacement for the poll tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACK in 1981 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher first pushed for the abolition of
domestic rates, Mr Michael Heseltine offered a simple solution to her most
pressing concern.
The then environment secretary told the then prime minister that if her main
worry was the high bills faced by little old ladies living alone in large
houses, the answer was simple. He would make local authorities give them a
big discount.
The rest is history. Mrs Thatcher did not take his advice. Mr Heseltine
moved on and then out of the Cabinet. The prime minister solved her problem
by replacing the rates with the poll tax. Mr Heseltine pushed her out of
Downing Street.
Today Mr Heseltine, back at environment under a new prime minister, will
outline his plan to replace the poll tax with a property tax which provides
a 25 per cent discount to little old ladies living alone in large houses.
The important details have already emerged; and despite of talk of further
consultation, the scheme will represent a firm proposal rather than an
option.
At first glance it looks a neat synthesis of political imperatives and
economic logic, though the realistic in Whitehall are still unsure of how
strong the joins are.
The tax will be levied on property classified in seven bands according to
capital value. Bills will be applied to households - with an assumption that
they contain two adults - rather than to individuals. The poorest will be
exempted entirely.
The present system of grant distribution using Standard Spending Assessments
will remain as will draconian 'capping' powers to prevent 'excessive'
spending by local authorities. There is little talk nowadays of preserving
'local democracy'.
The economic logic is there in the fact that a property tax restores some
relationship between individual wealth and the size of bills. The Duke in
his stately home will pay more than the dustman in his council flat. The
Treasury, which has always regarded property values as a reasonable proxy
for income, is satisfied. So too are the politicians who can claim this
makes the tax 'fair', or at least much fairer than the poll tax. All single
adults, including the famous little old lady, will get a 25 per cent
discount.
The political compromise reveals itself in the decision to compress and then
'cap' the increases in bills which can be applied to the different bands.
The government will set the bands nationally along with strict 'multipliers'
to regulate the proportion of revenue raised from properties in each
category.
Most importantly, the bill for a house worth, say, Pounds 1m or more in band
7 will not be more than 2.5 times higher than for the flat worth Pounds
40,000 in band 1. So the system will be progressive - about 90 per cent of
households will be unaffected by the 'cap' on band 7 - but, like the present
income tax structure, only up to a point.
Mr Heseltine hopes this compromise will calm Tory fears that a return to any
property tax would automatically create a swathe of 'losers' in the south.
The Budget switch of more than Pounds 4bn of local taxation to VAT should
ensure that average bills across the country should not be much more than
Pounds 350 per household. The multipliers will prevent councils from loading
the burden on to southern Tory voters who have benefited from the sharp rise
in property values over the past decade.
Bills for similar properties will not be identical across the country. A
three-bedroom semi in London will typically be in a higher band that a
similar house in Barnsley, so will attract a higher bill. The Treasury
thinks it should - incomes are higher in London than Barnsley. But the
politicians will control the size of the differential.
It all looks ingenious, and ministers are convinced that it will work. This
time, they insist, the Treasury is fully behind the new system. It has been
tested on the computers in Great George Street as well as those in Marsham
Street.
There is even a fig-leaf for those still wedded to the principle that all
should contribute to the cost of local services. Mr Heseltine will argue
that the two-person household assumed by the tax will capture 38m of the 42m
adults theoretically liable to pay the poll.
There is still, though, one serious weakness. Whatever the initial level of
bills, the commitment to the Uniform Business Rate means that any local tax
will be highly 'geared'. A 10 per cent rise in spending beyond that allowed
for in government grant would produce a 70 per cent rise in bills. More than
one senior minister is convinced that the UBR cannot survive in its present
form. But talk of raising the tax burden on industry is for after, not
before, the general election.

The flow of information on the environment would also be improved by the

THE Bruges group, the Tory-dominated organisation opposed to a Federal
Europe, last night reprimanded Mr Patrick Robertson, its secretary, for
issuing a statement earlier this month attacking the leadership style of Mr
John Major.
The group stopped short, however, of accepting his offer to resign - leading
to claims from some Conservatives that the group remained discredited. Mr
Major was accused in the statement of 'wobbling' and of engaging in gesture
politics over the Kurdish issue.
At a special meeting, the group approved a tightening of rules for issuing
statements on behalf of the group. Mr Robertson and Dr Alan Sked, who helped
draft the comments, offered 'an unqualified expression of regret'.

FT  23 APR 91 / Cathay will operate flights from Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATHAY PACIFIC will on May 1 become the second international airline to
offer its first services from London's Heathrow airport. The move follows
the government's decision to open Heathrow, the world's busiest
international passenger airport, to all carriers.
The start of Cathay's daily non-stop service between Heathrow and Hong Kong
will increase competition for British Airways at its home base of Heathrow.
Mr John Dance, Cathay's UK manager, said it was important for the airline to
operate from Heathrow as well as Gatwick to match BA's services. Heathrow
would give Cathay access to about 50 per cent of the UK market.
BA is already in competition with United Airlines for transatlantic
services. United started flights to Heathrow this month after winning
approval to take over Pan Am's London services.
A total of 10 international airlines, barred up to now from operating from
Heathrow, have successfully applied for rights to start services at London's
leading airport.
Royal Brunei will launch a twice-weekly service on May 7 from Heathrow to
Bandar Seri Begawan stopping at Dubai and Singapore.
Virgin Atlantic, Korean Airlines and All Nippon Airways are among airlines
planning new Heathrow services this summer.
These services are expected to lead to a fierce war on fares and promotions
between airlines vying for passengers in a depressed air-travel market.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, warned that the airline's
passenger volume was not expected to recover to levels reached before the
Gulf war until September or October. BA's traffic fell 13.2 per cent in
March compared with March 1990.
Mr Dance said Cathay intended to match all the promotions and lower fares
offered by BA, but added: 'I hope when we get to the peak season, there will
be a bit more sense seen by carriers.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Slowdown in managers' pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATE of increase in the total pay of managers slowed slightly in the
first quarter of 1991, leaving them on schedule for an increase of 13 per
cent for the full year.
That is the finding of the executive pay index produced by Noble Lowndes,
management consultants and actuaries.
The index, which includes the value of fringe benefits such as cars and
pensions as well as salaries and bonuses, is calculated quarterly for the
Financial Times. The latest figure is based on a survey of 5,085 managers in
396 companies throughout the UK.
In the first quarter the average total pay for all ranks of executives rose
by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 71,633.
The rise compares with a 3.5 per cent increase for the first three months of
1990 and a rise for the whole of last year of 13.8 per cent.
Although total pay increased, the recession was reflected by a decline in
the element made up of incentive bonuses to an average of Pounds 4,242 at
the start of this month, against Pounds 4,369 in early Jan-uary.
The salary element increased by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 50,771, the average
value of company cars by 4 per cent to Pounds 8,329, pension entitlements by
5.8 per cent to Pounds 7,014, and other benefits by 7.3 per cent to Pounds
1,277.

FT  23 APR 91 / Abta warns of delay in refunds when tour companies collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOOLS which had booked holidays through companies that later collapsed may
have to wait up to three months for a refund, according to the Association
of British Travel Agents.
Mr David Hurst, Abta's head of public affairs, said schools should apply to
Abta for their money and then book their trips again, rather than assign
their refunds to other companies.
Some schools are confused about how to respond to other companies, some
non-Abta, offering to take over trips which had been booked with failed
operators.
Abta has so far received 200 claims from customers of Adventure Travel
International (ATI), which ceased trading at the end of March, and a similar
number for Adventure Express, an un-related company which has also ceased
trading. The failure of Sun Living, a school tours group that went into
liquidation in February, has led to 1,000 claims.
The Earl of Scarborough High School at Skegness, Lincolnshire, has been
caught in the failures of two tour companies since February, and is awaiting
more than Pounds 20,000 in refunds from Abta. ATI's receiver has written a
letter saying the school remains 'principally liable' for a further Pounds
7,625.
According to Abta, the school will eventually receive its refund and should
not have to pay anything to the receiver. Mr Jim Whittaker, the school's
headmaster, said he planned to veto future group holidays.
The school had booked three holidays with Sun Living. Within an hour of the
announcement that the company had collapsed, Mr Whittaker received a call
from ATI offering to take over the planned trips on identical terms and
without further payment. With one group due to leave at the end of that
week, Mr Whittaker instructed Abta to pay the refund direct to ATI. Although
the holiday took place, it was 'substantially defective', he said.
The other two parties never boarded their coaches. In spite of its previous
undertaking, Mr Whittaker said, ATI asked for additional cash if the trips
were to proceed. He had to get an emergency payment of Pounds 13,066 from
Lincolnshire County Council.
Mr Whittaker said ATI assured him on March 28 that the groups would leave
the next day as planned. He learned three hours later that the company had
ceased trading.
'We have incurred considerable administrative costs in organising holidays
and dealing with cancellations for which there is no compensation,' Mr
Whittaker said .

affiliation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADES Union Congress is set to agree to the affiliation of the
breakaway Electrical and Plumbing Industries Union at a meeting of the TUC's
council tomorrow.
The move does not mean that the door is closed to the readmittance of the
EETPU electricians' union, the TUC said yesterday.
The EPIU, which has about 4,000 members, was formed by disaffected members
of the EETPU after that union's expulsion from the TUC in 1988. The
expulsion followed a recruitment row involving two single-union deals. The
TUC finance and general purposes committee yesterday put forward a
recommendation to the council that the EPIU should be allowed to affiliate.
The union was given observer status at the 1989 TUC congress, but was
refused full membership. The AEU engineering union argued then that the EPIU
was dependent on other unions, had no funds of its own or recognition deals
with employers and therefore could not be counted as an independent union.
Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, said from his union's annual
conference in Eastbourne yesterday: 'The wisdom of the F and GP decision is
questionable. However, this reinforces the case for the EETPU amalgamating
with the AEU.'
The TUC said that the EPIU was considered now to be self-sufficient and no
longer dependent on other unions.
A decision on the union's standing is also expected soon from the
government's certification officer.

funding

<TEXT>
EXTRA financial help is being provided by the government to ensure that its
guarantee of a place to all young people on its main training scheme for 16-
to 19-year-olds is met.
Essex Training and Enterprise Council warned last month that its funding
allocation of Pounds 12.3m for Youth Training in 1991-92 would leave about
5,000 young people without a YT place, out of an estimated total of 6,450 in
the county.
The warning came when many Tecs were expressing fears that cuts in funds for
YT, coupled with rising un-employment, could leave them unable to meet the
guaran-tee.
Mr Roy Lawrence, chairman of Essex Tec, said: 'Essex Tec is delighted that
the government has moved so swiftly to provide an extra amount - more than
Pounds 4m - in response to the recent review of YT in Essex.'
The Department of Employment said Essex Tec had been told that the
government would underwrite any overspend after the Tec had spent on YT the
Pounds 12.3m and any operating surpluses arising from savings on its other
training budgets.
The department said it believed Essex was the only Tec which had said it
could not meet the guarantee. If other Tecs made similar claims they would
have to be reviewed.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Civil Service union to urge rejection
of 8% pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of Britain's second-largest Civil Service union will be advised by
their leaders to reject the government's 8 per cent pay offer.
The executive of the NUCPS union also left open the possibility of a ballot
on industrial action if members accepted their rejection recommendation and
the government continued to refuse arbitration.
In contrast, the leadership of the CPSA, tbe largest Civil Service union,
decided to recommend their members to accept a separate 8 per cent offer.
The leaderships of both unions believe the 8 per cent offers break the
spirit of long-term pay agreements which allow a form of comparability with
the private sector.
Under the agreements, offers fall within the middle range of comparable
private-sector settlements in the previous year.
This year the range was 8 per cent to 10 per cent, with a median of 9 per
cent.
Although the offers are 8 per cent the majority of both unions' members will
receive less - 7.6 per cent in the case of CPSA and 7.8 per cent in NUCPS.
The balance is made up of high awards of up to 11 per cent for lower-paid
civil servants.
The Treasury has refused the two unions' request for arbitration.
Ms Marion Chambers, CPSA president, said her union executive felt the
alternative to recommending acceptance was industrial action and there was
no mood for this among members.
Some members of the NUCPS executive believe their members will also be
reluctant to take action.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Howard to put plan for workers' rights
to EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Howard, emp-loyment secretary, yesterday voiced his continuing
opposition to the European Commission's proposed directives on employees'
rights to information and consultation.
He said he would seek to replace them with his own five-point plan.
Mr Howard announced the initiative at a conference to launch a joint
government and Confederation of British Industry campaign to improve
business performance through employee involvement.
He will present the plan on employee involvement to an informal meeting of
his fellow employment ministers in the European Community in early May.
Mr Howard will urge the EC to adopt a voluntary approach towards encouraging
company policies for informing and consulting employees.
The EC has proposed more formal machinery for companies with concerns in
more than one member state, such as the formation of a works council
containing employees from each of the countries covered by the company.
Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the
British initiative looked like 'a smokescreen to cover the government's
embarrassment at being out of step in Europe'.
He said the UK government had consistently tried to veto European proposals
to give employees rights to information and consultation over company
decisions.
The aims of the five-point plan are:
To generate the commitment of all employees to the success of the business.
To enable the business to adapt to changing market requirements and improve
its prospects for the future.
To increase the satisfaction that employees get from their work.
To improve performance and productivity by drawing on the skills and
knowledge of all employees.
To provide all employees with the opportunity to contribute to the
development of their company.
Mr Howard said the voluntary approach allowed companies to establish
arrangements best suited to their own circumstances. He said: 'We shall
therefore continue to resist the imposition of Community legislation on this
subject. That is true of the worker participation proposals in the Fifth
Company Directive and the European Company Statute.' Mr Howard yesterday
said a study by his department showed Labour's economic policies could cost
2.2m jobs - leading Labour to protest at the use of government officials to
compile Tory 'propaganda'.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): London Tube workers vote to strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERVISORS and booking clerks on London Underground have voted to strike
over cuts of up to 1,800 jobs and changes in working practices, even though
the organisation says it will suspend any employee who takes part in
industrial action.
The ballot held by the TSSA white-collar union will be followed next week by
the result of a ballot about the same issue by 13,000 members of the RMT
transport union working on London Underground. The RMT has threatened a
series of one-day strikes after London Underground's refusal to negotiate on
job losses and changes in working patterns which are intended to help reduce
an anticipated loss of Pounds 92m.
The dispute has broken out at the same time as annual pay talks at British
Rail which resume today. The dispute threatens a repeat of the industrial
action on London Underground in 1989 at the same time as an industrial
dispute at British Rail.
Mr Richard Rosser, TSSA general secretary, said supervisors and
booking-office workers on London Underground did not have a history of
taking industrial action. He hoped managers would realise the strength of
feeling among workers. The TSSA has been upset both at the size of job
losses and at the effect on earnings of changes in working patterns. London
Underground has guaranteed no loss of earnings to staff for the first 18
months of the new rosters.
TSSA members voted for strike action by 575 votes to 289, out of a total of
1,553 ballot papers. London Underground said this result was 'certainly not
an example of a popular uprising'.
The RMT yesterday released a briefing paper given to London Underground
managers advising them of procedures for first warning and then suspending
any staff who take part in industrial action if strikes are called.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the briefing paper was 'the
action of a desperate, inadequate management' and was already rebounding on
them by making workers more determined to vote for and take industrial
action.
Mr Knapp said the savings from single staffing of stations and reductions in
overtime and weekend working would amount to only Pounds 400,000. The
savings would have little effect on the expected loss even if they were
implemented in full.

FT  23 APR 91 / The Guinness Appeals: 'Ambivalence' over Roux highlighted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN appeal court judge yesterday referred to the 'ambivalent attitude' of the
prosecution towards Mr Olivier Roux, the former Guinness finance director
and the principal prosecution witness.
Mr Justice Ognall said he was 'very troubled' about the status invested in
Mr Roux at the trial last year.
Mr Roux had admitted having known about an allegedly unlawful share support
operation mounted by Guinness during its takeover battle for Distillers, so
why had he not been an accomplice as far as the Crown had been concerned,
the judge asked.
Mr John Chadwick QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, replied that Mr Roux had
consistently said he had not regarded what was done during the bid as
dishonest.
How, the judge asked, did a witness's assertion that he was not dishonest
alter his status?
Mr Chadwick said that if Mr Roux had been treated as an accomplice from the
start, that would have taken the decision from the jury: they had to decide
whether they believed his evidence as to the honesty of the support
operation.
Mr Justice Ognall said: 'I suspect that at least some of the mischief that
has arisen in this particular case may have arisen because of the ambivalent
attitude of the Crown towards Mr Roux and his role in this enterprise.'
Mr Chadwick said the Crown had to form a view as to whether a person had
accepted his criminality. Mr Roux clearly had not, and the Crown had taken
the view that this was something to be left to the jury.
The exchanges came on the fifth day of appeals by Mr Ernest Saunders, former
Guinness chairman and chief executive, Mr Anthony Parnes, a City
stockbroker, and Mr Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron group, against their
convictions and sentences.
The appeals continue today.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S latest nuclear weapon, the Trident II warhead, should be
redesigned, suggests a draft report from Basic, a London-based think-tank
which specialises in critiques of Nato policy.
The study also calls for a halt to all movements of nuclear weapons in
Britain while an independent review is made of their safety in storage and
transport.
Basic's report draws upon criticism of US nuclear weapons levelled by
independent scientific assessors over a year ago, and assumes that British
weapon designs relate closely to their US counterparts.
Britain's first Trident submarine is scheduled to enter service in 1994. Its
warheads are believed to be behind schedule because of production
difficulties.
They were designed by the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston,
Berk-shire.

FT  23 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow trial: County man 'unaware' of stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER DALE, former managing director of County NatWest Securities,
yesterday insisted to the Blue Arrow trial that he had no knowledge of other
shares taken by County NatWest, CNWS's merchant banking co-subsidiary, until
the day the holding of a discloseable stake was publicly announced.
Mr Dale, a prosecution witness, said that until December 17 1987 he did not
know of the stake, worth almost 5 per cent of Blue Arrow, bought by County's
corporate advisory division.
He knew only of the 4.5 per cent holding taken by CNWS and a similar stake
held by Phillips &amp; Drew which, along with County, advised Blue Arrow on its
1987 rights issue.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals all deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the
outcome of the Pounds 837m rights issue.
Mr Dale said he had seen no problem in CNWS accepting its 31m shares from
County's corporate advisory division.
'It was only a problem if you were aware, as NatWest's senior management
were, of the corporate advisory holding and the P&amp;D holding,' he told Mr
Alun Jones QC, for Mr Stephen Clark, a County director and one of the
defendants.
He denied the suggestion from Mr Jones that he had known what was going on.
Mr Dale agreed that he had allowed Stock Exchange rules to be breached by
delaying the reporting to the exchange that the 5 per cent disclosure limit
had been exceeded in normal trading, but described this as 'relatively
trivial'.
Mr Dale told the court that he had been informed by Miss Elizabeth Brimelow,
then compliance director, that County was considering making a larger
disclosure and that the matter was being dealt with at a senior level within
NatWest, the parent bank.
When he learnt of the stake held by the corporate advisory division, he had
said the full holding should be disclosed.
However, since he still thought legal advice had been taken, his concern was
not fully aroused.
The trial continues today.

<TEXT>
AN ANGLO-SOVIET cargo airline is being set up to specialise in transporting
heavy loads, using the Russian-built Antonov AN124 Ruslan, one of the
world's biggest aircraft, capable of carrying 150 tonnes of cargo.
The joint venture airline involves a partnership between HeavyLift Cargo
Airlines, a subsidiary of the UK Trafalgar House group, and the Soviet
Volga-Dnepr company. The airline is expected to start operating in June,
adding more AN124s to its fleet before this year ends.
The Soviet transport aircraft, equipped with on-board hoist and crane
systems to load heavy goods both front and back, with minimum ground
equipment, will be used to carry the largest tracked or wheeled vehicles,
aerospace and space-related components, oil pollution control gear, building
materials and relief supplies for international agencies.
HeavyLift Cargo Airlines operates a fleet of large Belfasts, Hercules,
Boeing 707s and Guppy aircraft to transport heavy loads.
Soviet officials described the joint venture as 'an important contribution
to developing Anglo-Soviet trade and economic relations'.
The Soviet partner is one of the first joint stock enterprises set up in the
Soviet Union. Still ultimately controlled by the state, these new
enterprises do not come under the rigid departmental control, enjoying
greater operating flexibility.

FT  23 APR 91 / World Trade News: AT&amp;T, NEC to develop new chip technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T Microelectronics, a division of the US telecommunications company, and
NEC of Japan will jointly develop technologies to make future generations of
semiconductors, they said yesterday.
The agreement comes as Washington and Tokyo are negotiating a new pact on
semiconductor market access in Japan, and is a sign Japanese companies
intend to build closer links to the US electronics industry, in an attempt
to reduce trade tension.
For the next two years, the two companies have agreed to develop jointly the
manufacturing processes for further miniaturisation, enabling them to
increase the memory capacity and functions of an individual chip.
While other semiconductor companies compete to develop similar technology,
executives of the two companies said the joint effort would provide big
advantages.
Mr William Warwick, president of AT&amp;T Microelectronics, claimed developing
the 0.35-micron process, as the system is known, is likely to cost Dollars
400m (Pounds 232m) to Dollars 500m.
A micron is a millionth of a metre. The smaller the micron measurement, the
more advanced the chip. The next generation of memory chips, 16-megabit
chips, are being developed using 0.5-micron technology.
AT&amp;T and NEC are aiming for even more chip generations with the 0.35-micron
technology. The companies will be sharing sensitive technologies in
ultra-fine etching and circuiting, but say they are likely to have few
problems in sorting out ownership rights of new processes.
'If the patent is developed from the joint effort, it will be used by both
of us. If there are necessary patents that we already own, they will be
licensed for the joint work,' Mr Warwick said.
The companies plan to break down the development process into tasks they
call 'modules', with 50-70 researchers from each company working on each
module. There will be about 25 of these modules, and the two companies will
exchange at least one researcher for each module, and have agreed to report
regularly on progress.
The project follows a more general pact signed in March last year, where the
companies agreed to co-operate in semiconductor development.
'The relationship represents a win-win situation for both companies. Through
partnering, each company shares resources, lowers individual company risks
and gains timely access to technology,' Mr Warwick said.
Mr Tomihiro Matsumura, NEC executive vice-president, said the agreement
represents 'true co-operation between two multinational semiconductor
companies', and proves the enthusiasm of each for 'a long-term co-operative
relationship'.

FT  23 APR 91 / World Trade News: US prepares to repel Chinese software
pirates - Peking is being challenged to prove it can protect foreign
intellectual property, writes Lynne Curry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDER pressure from the US and other foreign business executives, China is
attempting to strengthen its patent law and develop a code for the
protection of computer software manufacturers, but is hampered by
conflicting domestic interests.
The Chinese government is also making efforts to revise its patent law and
draft copyright regulations to protect computer software manufacturers, but
doing so involves many Chinese companies and 'could be a hard job',
according to the official English language China Daily.
China's lack of copyright regulations and its limited patent law were the
subject of discussion between the Chinese and a visiting US official in
February.
'The concern is enormous', said the official, Mr Joseph Massey, assistant US
trade representative. 'If the problem of piracy of software doesn't get
fixed, we will have to take action.'
While software piracy is rampant, illegal copying of other proprietary works
is also widespread. Entire sections of some bookstores only sell
unauthorised copies of foreign books.
Other examples of piracy include records, video tapes, computer hardware and
even the Disney characters, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. The purpose of Mr
Massey's visit was to determine how much progress the Chinese have made
towards drafting copyright legislation which would provide effective
protection for computer software manufacturers.
'It's at an early stage, but we have a lot of problems with what we have
seen,' Mr Massey said.
The trade representative said China must show progress on its draft
copyright regulations before April 15, the statutory deadline under US law,
when the trade office makes recommendations to the administration about
retaliatory actions against countries deemed to be following unfair trade
practices with the US.
This can result in additional tariffs on a country's exports to the US.
China is already on a 'priority watch' list, because of concern about the
piracy problem and inadequate efforts to prevent it.
In an effort to resolve the problems, a Chinese delegation was expected in
Washington in mid-April for talks on intellectual property rights and
bilateral scientific co-operation.
China's current patent law does not provide adequate protection for chemical
and pharmaceutical products, according to western lawyers. It protects only
the process by which a compound is made, not the product. If a chemical
process is altered only slightly, pirated versions of an already patented
compound could be made legally in China. The Chinese are considering
expanding the patent law, extending the protection period for inventions to
20 years from the present 15 and widening protection to include the product
directly obtained by such a process, according to the China Daily.
But the debate is believed to be deadlocked, with some ministries supporting
the proposed revision and the Ministry of Chemical Industry fighting it.
Apart from problems with pharmaceutical products, software piracy has
reached epidemic proportions in China. US software manufacturers estimate
that unauthorised copying of software has resulted in Dollars 400m of annual
lost sales to China.
The traditional Chinese approach to copyright and other intellectual
property issues differs significantly from the western view that some works
have proprietary ownership.
'The Chinese consider it an honour to lift someone else's work and publish
it,' said one Western businessman involved with copyright problems.
'The Chinese have a much harder time formulating a law which is acceptable
to the west, because the idea of certain work belonging to an individual is
antithetical to socialist precepts,' one western lawyer said.
A vague copyright law will become effective in June. Western observers say
problems with the legislation arise not only with its vagueness but with the
implementing regulations being debated by Chinese officials. The law does
not stipulate on the time limit that a work can be protected, and it states
that a foreign work can only be protected if it was first published or
produced in China, according to western lawyers.
Much secrecy surrounds implementing regulations which would provide more
detail about the scope of the copyright law.
Mofert is believed to favour strong copyright regulations, while ministries
 -such as the Ministry of Chemical Industry - with vested interests in
continuing to make cheap, illegal copies of software have opposed the
legislation.
'Certain ministries have been told to pirate as much software as they can,
so that when the law does go into effect, they will have everything,' one
western executive said.
'Mofert has overall responsibility for this issue, but the other ministries
are telling Mofert to get lost.'
Not all ministries are copying software illegally, and some do recognise
proprietary rights.
But Western analysts say that China's ability to provide adequate protection
for foreign intellectual property is vital if the country wants continued
access to investment and high technology.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH SNCF rail board yesterday placed orders for FFr10bn (Pounds
990m)-worth of double-decker high-speed trains with a consortium led by
GEC-Alsthom, the Franco-British engineering group.
This is one of SNCF's biggest orders and aims to boost capacity of its
near-saturated domestic Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) routes in the second
half of the decade, so cutting the need for new track.
This will be greeted with relief by environmental groups, which have
protested against plans to extend the 10-year-old Paris-Lyon TGV line to the
Mediterranean.
The double-deckers will take the expected strain on the Paris-Brussels TGV
route, two years after it opens in 1993, but will be too large for the UK
end of the Channel Tunnel line.
The order comes as GEC-Alsthom is negotiating against Italian, German and
Swiss competition for four overseas TGV contracts, in Canada, the US, South
Korea and Taiwan.
The double-deckers will carry 520 passengers, 35 per cent more than existing
single-deckers, but cruise at the same 300 kmh as the newest TGVs now in
service. Each train includes eight carriages, with a locomotive at each end.
The contract includes firm orders to develop and produce 45 trains, with 55
more under option. Other consortium members include ANF Industries, France's
second biggest maker of railway rolling stock, and De Dietrich, the French
electrical engineering and household appliance group.

FT  23 APR 91 / World Trade News: Hopes for Congress fast-track approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPROMISE proposal, introduced yesterday in the US Senate, improves the
chances for congressional approval of the 'fast-track' negotiating authority
necessary for an extension of the Uruguay Round trade talks.
However, under the plan submitted by Senator Donald Riegle, chairman of the
Senate banking committee, Congress would hold a much tighter rein on talks
for a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.
The fast track is a parliamentary procedure that speeds trade negotiations
by allowing Congress only a single yes-or-no vote on trade pacts. Mr Riegle
is proposing to grant the fast track for the Uruguay Round but to permit
Congress to amend the FTA in selected areas.
The senator is typical of many in both houses of Congress, supporting the
Uruguay Round but concerned that an FTA would mean the loss of manufacturing
jobs to Mexico.
The combined opposition to both has put in jeopardy the administration's
prime trade objectives. Either the House or the Senate can kill the fast
track by voting against it by June 1.
In a press conference yesterday, Mr Riegle accused the administration of
proposing the pact for foreign policy, rather than economic policy,
considerations. The US economy is getting worse, he said, not better.
'Mexico is too poor to buy most of our products, but is often willing to
sacrifice its environment and worker safety to lure US companies with
low-wage rates,' he said. Mexican workers earn one-tenth of that earned by
US workers, and the country's work safety, child labour and environmental
laws are only loosely enforced.
Under Mr Riegle's proposal, Congress would be permitted to amend an FTA pact
in the five areas of greatest congressional concern: labour standards;
environmental protection; 'rule of origin' which would prevent other nations
from funneling goods through Mexico into the US; assistance for American
workers displaced by imports; and dispute resolution.

FT  23 APR 91 / Washington bank group attacks Polish debt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Euromarkets Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by the Paris Club of creditor governments to forgive at least
half Poland's debt is unhelpful for the stability of the international
financial system, the Institute of International Finance, the
Washington-based group which promotes the views of international banks, said
yesterday.
Mr Horst Schulmann, IIF managing director, described the forgiving of
Poland's debts as foreign aid through the back door. It would lead other
debtor governments to seek similar treatment, he said, suggesting it would
contribute to the breakdown of order in international finance.
He also criticised the pressure on banks to match the Paris Club. 'In
contrast to governments, banks cannot be in the aid business,' he said.
This pressure was one of two developments over the past six months - the
other being the continued growth of interest arrears owed by developing
countries to commercial banks - which were damaging the prospects for flows
of private capital to middle-income countries, he said.
The IIF calculated that interest arrears owed to banks grew to Dollars
26.8bn (Pounds 14.9bn) at the end of March, from about Dollars 18bn six
months earlier. The figure includes Dollars 9.5bn owed in interest by
Brazil, which reached a preliminary agreement with banks on clearing Dollars
8bn of interest arrears this month - an agreement which must be ratified by
Brazil's senate and 95 per cent of creditor banks.
Mr Schulmann said the fact that some countries were allowed to build up
arrears while others, particularly in Asia, did not, showed a double
standard. Financial institutions should refuse all new loans to countries in
arrears until they have an effective agreement to eliminate them.
He called on finance ministers, in Washington this week for the spring
meetings of the IMF and World Bank, to address three issues: the global
capital shortage, which could not be managed merely by lowering interest
rates; interest arrears by debtor countries; and the growing 'moral hazard'
in the international financial system, epitomised by the Polish debt
forgiveness deal.

FT  23 APR 91 / De Klerk urges more UK links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT F W de Klerk of South Africa last night appealed to Mr John Major
the UK prime minister to help him win investment as apartheid is steadily
dismantled. It was the two leaders' first meeting.
At a working supper at the British premier's official residence in London Mr
Major told him efforts to end race policies should be rewarded by the
scrapping of sanctions and the sports boycott which has left South Africa
isolated.
Mr de Klerk, on a two-day visit to London, earlier held a private meeting
with representatives of banks and financial institutions, at which he called
for the strengthening of trade and investment links between Britain and
Pretoria.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, was among senior
bankers present. Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank and
Sir John Quinton, his Barclays Bank counterpart, are also believed to have
attended the meeting.
Mr de Klerk is accompanied by his deputy foreign minister, Mr Leon Wessels,
who met Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, in the afternoon.
Today Mr de Klerk will address the conference of the Institute of Directors,
and speak at the Royal Institute for International Affairs. He leaves
tomorrow for Denmark, before flying to Ireland on Thursday and back to
London on Friday to speak to the Confederation of British Industry and the
UK-South Africa Trade Association.
Amnesty International, the human rights organisation, yesterday criticised
what it called 'the lack of accountability' of the South African security
forces.
Amnesty said there was 'a pattern of unlawful behaviour by members of the
security forces' which lent weight to 'allegations of unprovoked use . . .
of lethal force.'
The statement called on the government 'to bring to justice those members of
the security forces responsible for human rights violations'.

<TEXT>
EXTREME right-wing members of the Israeli government said yesterday Mr
Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, had promised them he would not
compromise on Jewish settlement of the occupied territories, despite
Washington's protests that continued settlement could upset its Middle East
peace effort.
Meanwhile Mr Yossi Ben-Aharon, head of the prime minister's office, said the
government would not accept any Palestinian from Jerusalem in a Palestinian
delegation to talks and opposed extending the role of a proposed regional
peace conference beyond an opening function for later bilateral
negotiations.
Both issues - along with settlements - are among the obstacles to convening
Arab-Israeli talks that Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, will seek
to overcome when he returns to Israel today for further talks.
Mr Shamir met the Tehiya party, a three-member faction in the coalition led
by the Likud party, and a group of settlers to discuss their concerns. Ms
Geula Cohen, a Tehiya junior minister, said afterwards Mr Shamir had
'promised that settlement will not be harmed'.
Ending Jewish settlement of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is a key demand of
Palestinians and other potential Arab peace conference participants. But Mr
Shamir's government has repeatedly vowed that it should continue.
Yesterday, opposition politicians published a report they said showed
mortgage subsidies beyond those available in Israel proper were on offer to
settlers to encourage faster settlement.

FT  23 APR 91 / Soviet Union collapse not in west's interest, warns Hurd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISINTEGRATION of the Soviet Union into separate states was contrary to
the interests of the rest of Europe and the west as a whole, Mr Douglas
Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said in London yesterday.
Mr Hurd, who was addressing the British Atlantic Group of Young Politicians,
conceded that the western European states could not have much influence on
developments inside the Soviet Union. That was a matter for the Soviet
people themselves.
'But what we can say is that it is not in the interests of Europe as a
whole, or of the west, to see the Soviet Union disintegrate into a
kaleidoscope of republics, some quite weak, some divided within their own
boundaries, and leaving a possibility of continuing disorder and weakness .
. .'
What the west wanted to see was a Soviet Union which was dedicated to
reform, and in which the links between the various republics were based on
consent rather than on command and force. It wanted to help the Soviet Union
to reform itself.
Turning to the lessons that Europe should draw from the events of the past
year and the Gulf war, in particular, Mr Hurd expressed strong support for
greater foreign policy co-ordination within the EC.
'I can see in our dealings with the Soviet Union . . . over events in the
Baltic states, that it really would be crazy if there were separate and
contrasted British, French, German, Italian policies towards what is
happening in the Soviet Union,' Mr Hurd said.
However, he reiterated Britain's opposition to majority voting on foreign
and security policy issues, which, Mr Hurd claimed, would have led to a less
effective European reaction in the Gulf crisis.
In the aftermath of the Gulf conflict, one particular problem which the
Twelve should now be considering, in co-operation with the US, the Soviet
Union and China, was the problem of arms exports and the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.
In spite of calling for greater intra-European co-operation on security and
defence policies, Mr Hurd stressed that Nato remained 'the main defence
institution of western Europe and the Atlantic'.
While Nato had to be reformed if it were to survive and remain relevant, to
allow it to disappear would be 'to spit in the face of the lessons of
history. It would be a great foolishness, the kind of foolishness we
committed in the past and regretted.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa arrives in London today hoping for good weather and
determined to convey some 'home truths' about the way western countries are
dragging their feet over reuniting Europe in the twilight of the cold war.
'I perform badly when its rainy and misty' he said, adding: 'I've had the
sun on my other trips,' referring to recent journeys to Washington, Paris
and Brussels where he has urged western investors to come to Poland.
These visits have revealed west European leaders unwilling to speed
integration with post-Communist countries at the moment when, according to
Mr Walesa, 'everything is possible'.
In Britain he will be encouraging businessmen to put money into Poland,
where the government is maintaining strict monetary controls in an attempt
to lower inflation to a monthly 1 per cent by the end of the year.
Mr Walesa will meet bankers at the Bank of England on Thursday and urge them
to halve the Dollars 11bn his country owes them, as western governments have
agreed to do.
His visit comes in the wake of 40 hours of talks in Paris at the weekend
between Polish negotiators and representatives of 17 western countries to
whom Poland owes Dollars 33bn. The talks produced a framework for a 50 per
cent debt reduction.
This foresees Poland devoting Dollars 600m a year until 1994 to debt service
payments, by which time the debt should have been reduced by half on
condition that Poland maintains its anti-inflation programme agreed with the
International Monetary Fund.
Repayment of the entire debt, however, should be complete by the year 2014.
President Walesa will be staying with the Queen at Windsor during his
three-day visit. Meetings with Mr John Major and Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the
present and former prime ministers, and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour party
leader, are also envisaged.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE TO protect the European Community's troubled electronics industry
intensified over the weekend at a crisis meeting between key members of the
European Commission and the EC's five main electronics companies.
The industrialists pressed their case for specific support measures going
beyond the general plan presented by Brussels last month to channel more EC
research money into demand-creating infrastructure projects. The
commissioners apparently expressed sympathy for the companies' increasing
difficulty with Japanese competition, but in no way committed the EC
executive, officials said yesterday.
The secret meeting was called last Friday and Saturday in a small town in
Burgundy by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, with Bull and
Thomson, France's state-controlled electronics companies, Siemens of
Germany, Olivetti of Italy and Philips of the Netherlands. Also present were
Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, Mr Filippo Maria
Pandolfi, the research commissioner, and their two directors-general.
The attempted secrecy of the meeting, news of which leaked into the French
press over the weekend, reflects the sensitivity of the issue, as much
within the Community as in relations with Japan.
Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner who had succeeded in pruning
dirigiste elements out of the Commission's March paper on the electronics
sector, was a notable absentee from the Burgundy meeting, though he was
assured in advance that it would not compromise his policy of controlling
state aids. Sir Leon is examining the complaint by ICL of Britain, which is
majority-owned by Fujitsu of Japan, against the French government's recent
decision to inject FFr6bn (Pounds 590m) of fresh capital into Bull and
Thomson.
Mr Alain Gomez, the chairman of Thomson, recently called for the
establishment of high EC customs duties on Japanese electronic goods for an
adjustment period of five years. 'That will be enough for us to catch up the
unwarranted advantage acquired by the Japanese thanks to 30 years of unfair
competition,' he told Le Monde newspaper. An EC official said yesterday that
Mr Gomez's ideas could not be considered close to Commission thinking.
Tomorrow, EC research ministers will discuss, at France's insistence, the
issue of whether foreign-owned companies should participate in EC research
programmes. ICL was recently barred from a couple of Esprit information
technology programmes in which it had been marginally involved. But UK
officials said yesterday Mr Pandolfi had assured them that ICL would not be
excluded from any important research on grounds of its ownership.

FT  23 APR 91 / Kohl's chickens home to roost: Chancellor's problems are of
his own making, writes David Marsh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS Chancellor Helmut Kohl's problems over German unity have been
manifestly increasing, his capacity to do anything about them has now
plummeted. Sunday's crushing defeat for his Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate leaves Mr Kohl's party in control in
only one of the 10 west German states making up the old Federal Republic.
The loss of the right's majority in the upper house of parliament, the
Bundesrat (federal council), which has a veto over all tax legislation,
significantly constrains Mr Kohl's ability to govern. Less than five months
after the Chancellor gained a sweeping victory in the December 2 all-German
general elections, German politics is facing a confused period of
confrontation, uncertainty and drift.
The centre-right coalition in Bonn, made up of the CDU, the Bavarian
Christian Social Union (CSU), and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP),
still has a secure majority in the lower house, the Bundestag. But Germany's
highly developed system of political checks and balances now deprives Mr
Kohl of the necessary means to push through unpopular decisions.
A large part of his misfortunes stems from his lack of foresight last year
in failing to present voters with a more accurate picture of the economic
and social challenges caused by German unification. Mr Hans-Werner Meyer,
the head of Germany's Trade Union Federation (DGB), believes that, if Mr
Kohl had announced the likelihood of tax rises before the December
elections, he would probably have won with a still higher majority.
As it is, following the large rises in taxes and social security levies
decided in February, the Chancellor is now paying a triple price for his
foolishness. First, as was widely predicted at the end of his year of
victory in 1990, his personal credibility has taken a nosedive.
Second, the round of Social Democrat election successes in recent state
polls has resurrected regional coalitions between the SPD and the Greens in
Lower Saxony, Hesse and now (probably) Rhineland-Palatinate. This has
effectively resurrected at a regional level the Greens party which is one of
Mr Kohl's pet hates, and which appeared to be close to extinction after its
collapse in the national December elections.
Third, Mr Kohl's misfortunes have prepared the way for a new spate of
coalition bickering. The Chancellor's slightly bizarre revelation a
fortnight ago that Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the wheelchair-bound interior
minister, was the most likely man to succeed him has been roundly criticised
by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and CSU chairman. Mr Waigel - who
shares the blame for last year's extraordinary economic policy insouciance -
believes that the premature start to a leadership debate has damaged the
coalition's poll standing.
Mr Waigel himself has done his bit towards incurring the wrath of the
free-market wing of the FDP, by announcing at the end of last week his
decision to water down plans for cuts in the next few years in taxes on
companies and high-earners. But these would anyway now have been blocked by
the SPD majority in the Bundesrat - as well as by the need to trim the
swelling budget deficit.
In view of decision-making disarray, and the sharp deterioration in
Germany's financial position, Mr Kohl's main hope is that an international
economic recovery later this year come to Germany's rescue.
Unfortunately, the foreign exchange markets - where the D-Mark fell
yesterday to a 17-month low against the dollar - may upset the prospects.
With the Bundesbank signalling its desire to press harder on the monetary
brakes to bolster the D-Mark, Mr Kohl may face before too long, in addition
to the recession in east Germany, a sharp slowdown in growth in the
previously booming west.

FT  23 APR 91 / Gas price formula may go to MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas could face a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation if
it fails to agree in the next week to revise its formula for setting the
price of gas for 17m domestic and small business customers.
The company was last night finalising its response to an 11-month review
into the formula and said it would respond to the industry regulator's
proposals by the end of April.
The Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas) is apparently planning to turn the review
over to the MMC if British Gas does not respond in the next week. The
pricing formula review is the first since British Gas was privatised five
years ago.
If British Gas accepts Ofgas's proposals, it will face tighter controls on
standards of service and a less generous pricing formula, which should
reduce consumers' energy costs.
Ofgas argues that, in the absence of competitive suppliers of gas, it must
force British Gas to set public standards, for example on call-out times and
disconnections, against which it can be held to account.
Under its current price formula, British Gas can increase prices by the rate
of general price inflation, less an efficiency clawback of two percentage
points. The company is also allowed to pass on to customers all increases in
the cost of North Sea gas.
Gas users have complained that this structure provides no incentive for
British Gas to seek lower-priced supplies. Ofgas has also queried whether
British Gas operates its own gas fields in the most efficient way.
At the same time, Ofgas is likely to reduce the amount British Gas can add
to prices to account for inflation. This is most likely to take the form of
increasing the so-called efficiency factor from two to perhaps three or four
percentage points a year.
When the regulator revamped British Telecom's pricing structure three years
ago, this element was increased from three to 4.5 percentage points.
The Gas Consumers Council has called on British Gas to cut the
inflation-related increase it adds on to prices, but not by cutting the
quality of service it offers consumers.

FT  23 APR 91 / Dollar hits 16-month high against weakened D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR rose to a 16-month high yesterday on the back of a fast-falling
D-Mark, weakened in the political aftermath of the weekend's state election
in Germany.
Sterling was also undermined as the US unit kept up its gains on hopes of an
imminent end to the US recession.
In Germany and abroad, the vote against the ruling Christian Democrats was
seen as a further blow for Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, when the
condition of the east German economy is causing increasing concern.
The defeat in Mr Kohl's home state of Rhineland-Palatinate also removes the
government's majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, which
has the power to veto legislation.
The dollar was also helped by comments from Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank
director, who restated the bank's policy of following a monetary and not an
exchange rate goal.
Dealers took this to mean the Bundesbank did not intend to intervene heavily
to stem the dollar's rise, although it is keen that the German currency
should remain strong to help ward off rising inflation.
Central banks have not been intervening to curb the marks recent falls with
concerted dollar sales. This has added to market perceptions that the US
authorities are happy to see the dollar strengthen further, and that the
Federal Reserve is content with the current level of interest rates.
As the Bundesbank is thought to be unwilling to stem the D-Mark's fall, the
markets are expecting the currency volatility to last at least until
agreements about interest rates emerge from this week's meeting of the Group
of Seven in Washington.
The dollar climbed to a Frankfurt close of DM1.7585 - its highest since the
end of 1989 - and continued to gain in New York where it finished at
DM1.762.
German share prices fell back with the currency. On the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the DAX index shed 1.7 per cent to 1,571.91.
US share prices were also weaker. Disappointment at the Federal Reserve's
refusal to cut interest rates combined with profit-taking to leave the Dow
Jones Industrial Average 37.87 lower at 2,927.72. The Dow has fallen more
than 76 points since it reached its record 3,004.46 on Wednesday.
There were also sharp falls in the pound - losing 3 cents in London to
Dollars 1.6925 before edging back to Dollars 1.6955 in New York - and on
London's equity market, where the FT-SE 100 index ended 29.3 lower at
2490.8.
Sterling, which has been weakened by recent economic data suggesting that
the recession has yet to touch its trough, is also becoming vulnerable to
political uncertainty ahead of the local elections on May 2.

FT  23 APR 91 / Budget sparks big rise in retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S high streets saw their sharpest increase in business for almost 12
years last month as shoppers hurried to beat the April deadline for VAT and
excise increases announced in the Budget.
Retail sales figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed
that volumes rose by a provisional 3.7 per cent in March, after a fall of
0.1 per cent in February.
This was the largest monthly rise since June 1979, when volumes surged by
6.9 per cent in the wake of a similarly unexpected decision to raise VAT.
Few industry analysts, however, expect volume levels to be sustained into
April.
In the Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced his intention to
raise VAT to 17.5 per cent to pay for big reductions in individual poll tax
bills. This increase had a particularly marked effect on sales of large
electrical goods, televisions, furniture and carpets in the last two weeks
of March, according to the Retail Consortium, which says it represents 90
per cent of the industry.
The Budget's indexation of excise duties on alcohol led to 'excellent' sales
of wines and spirits ahead of the price increases on April 1, the consortium
said.
The other big factor boosting sales was that the whole Easter period -
traditionally a time for heavy purchases of confectionery and gifts - fell
in March, said the CSO.
The month also benefited from the stimulus of balmy weather and interest
rate cuts.
The CSO said no adjustment had been made to account for the timing of
Easter. The monthly value of sales in March was Pounds 12.2bn against Pounds
9.26bn the previous month.
Trends in retail sales remain depressed. In February, a provisional 1 per
cent rise was subsequently revised into a final 0.1 per cent fall. The
underlying rate of growth in sales volumes during the three months to March
was still only 0.9 per cent, and 0.6 per cent lower than the same period a
year ago.
The Treasury said it was 'difficult to draw any underlying conclusions' from
the figures, which had been 'propelled upwards by the VAT measure and the
Easter holiday.'
Mr David Walton of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said record rises
in unemployment and sharp contraction of credit growth suggested a
consumer-led recovery was still a long way off. He expects sales volumes
this month to fall by about 3 per cent.
The surge had little impact on London's financial markets, which remained
preoccupied by the internal troubles of Germany and the rise of the dollar.
The provisional index of retail sales volumes was 122.9 (1985=100) in March,
after 118.5 in February.

PLANS FOR sharp curbs on strikes and political rallies in the Soviet Union,
coupled with an emergency system for distributing grain and other foodstuffs
were put before parliament in Moscow yesterday by Mr Valentin Pavlov, the
prime minister.
The proposed programme to deal with the country's escalating economic crisis
also calls for financial stabilisation measures, giving Gosbank, the central
bank, the power to control spending by republican governments.
The measures are almost certain to be approved by the parliament and Mr
Pavlov suggested that the Kremlin may resort to force to implement them. The
proposals involve banning strikes and political rallies during working
hours.
Hard-liners in the Soyuz (Union) group called for the declaration of a state
of emergency which would impose a ban on strikes and bring rebel republics
to heel. Mr Pavlov said in response: 'They are right in two respects. There
is a need for a special regime in certain crucial branches of the economy,
such as energy and transport, and in certain regions.'
Although it seeks to encourage privatisation and foreign investment, the
plan has been criticised by the country's leading economists as too vague to
combat the budget crisis.
Mr Pavlov stressed that the so-called anti-crisis programme required
co-operation with the republics and that any use of force would be limited.
In the case of the current coal strikes, he suggested that force could be
used to allow working miners to cross picket lines.
He said: 'A state of emergency, or special regime, does not mean that people
will be forced back to work, but it is possible to let people work with the
help of force. For that purpose, we do not need the army.'
President Mikhail Gorbachev, who faces threats to his leadership from his
own Communist Party and as a result of strikes backed by opposition forces,
is under pressure to opt for a coalition government.
However, Mr Pavlov rejected calls for a coalition. He said his appeal a few
months ago for alternative cabinet nominations had been ignored by the
republics.
He added that it was not up to him to decide whether to agree to the
proposal by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, for 'round table' talks
with republican leaders and opposition forces.
Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, said, however, that
the government could not introduce market reforms without recognising the
sovereignty of republics.
Mr Pavlov's programme also proposes that republics which refuse to sign a
union treaty and contribute to the union budget should be charged hard
currency for raw materials and energy. Only eight out of 15 republics have
agreed to sign the treaty incorporating them into a political federation.
The economic union proposal, approved by the republics last year as the
foundation for economic reform, committed republics to a common market and
currency, a financial stabilisation programme, and rapid privatisation.
Mr Gorbachev is due to discuss the draft treaty with the republics today.
One possible compromise would be to stop trying to push republics into
signing the treaty if they agree to drop trade barriers, subscribe to a
common financial policy, and delegate limited responsibilities to the
central government.

Slow but steady take-off - Patrick Blum discusses Madeira as an offshore
business centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS not exactly been plain sailing for Madeira's offshore business
centre. Establishing a new legal framework to cover financial institutions,
manufacturers in the free trade zone and a new international shipping
register has taken up more time and encountered more bureaucratic obstacles
than expected. Nevertheless, Madeira is slowly taking off as a viable
alternative or addition to existing offshore centres in Europe and
elsewhere.
'If you look at the early years of other centres, their own development was
not any faster than ours. Early days are always difficult,' says Mr
Francisco Costa, chairman of the Madeira Development Company (SDM), which is
responsible for developing the island's offshore activities.
In spite of initial problems, Madeira already has attracted a good number of
businesses including 13 banks, 231 service and trading companies, and 10
manufacturing companies. Another five banks have applied to set up an
offshore branch, 10 more service companies have applied for a licence, and
three more manufacturing companies are waiting for authorisation to operate
in the free trade zone. Response to the shipping register has been slower
with only five vessels registered so far.
Initially, only branches of banks and investment companies could operate in
the offshore centre. This was later extended to all financial institutions.
Now new laws are being prepared to allow funds to be domiciled locally and
to enable the local incorporation of full banks and insurance companies as
opposed to only branches. Mr Costa expects these to be in place this year.
The shipping register has posed bigger problems. Until now, all crews for
Portuguese registered ships had to be 100 per cent Portuguese, a standard
requirement in Portugal. This is in the process of being changed so that
crews will only need to be 50 per cent from the European Community.
Restrictive and uncompetitive Portuguese mortgage regulations were another
problem, and this is also being changed to allow ship-owners to choose the
law under which they will operate when registering a ship. New legislation
will also allow private yachts to be registered.
Mr Carlos Sousa, general manager of Steermar, a ship management services
company, says he expects to register 80-100 ships in the first year after
the new law is approved. 'Foreign shippers are waiting for the change. We've
had many enquiries, especially from Germany,' he says.
The free trade zone has had more success with a mix of companies from as far
apart as Brazil (plastics), Ireland (gold and jewellery), Lebanon (textiles
and marble), Liechtenstein (precision optical instruments), Hong Kong
(garments), and Portugal (construction materials, tobacco, electronics,
food, and chemicals). Only a handful have started work, the others are
building their own factories or in the process of installing machinery.
The free zone is on a 120-hectare site on Madeira's eastern coast some 8km
from the airport and 30km from Funchal, the island's main town. Next to the
smaller town of Canical, it is easily accessible though the roads and a
tunnel leading to the site are having to be widened and upgraded to cope
with the heavier traffic. About half the initial 40 hectares to be prepared
in a first phase of development have been completed: the land levelled,
roads and infrastructures including water supplies and telecommunications
installed. Work on a new deep sea port directly serving the site began in
October 1990 and is due to be completed by the middle of next year. The
island's main airport will be expanded to enable it to receive bigger
aircraft and to improve freight facilities.
Officials say rents are competitive at Dollars 13.50 per square metre of
land per year for a minimum of five years for companies building their own
installations, and Dollars 40 per square metre for ready-made building.
Offshore financial business is centred in Funchal. So far all but one of the
bank branches established are Portuguese. The exception is Lloyds Bank Fund
Management of Guernsey, to be joined soon by Banque Franco Portugaise of
France. Mr Costa believes this is to be expected of the centre's
development. 'It is important to have Portuguese banks. It has a
demonstration effect showing Portuguese banks are confident about the
centre's prospects.'
The banks do any type of business from taking deposits - there is strong
competition for remittances of emigrant Portuguese workers and the savings
of the wider Portuguese community around the world - to trade financing,
fund management and granting credit.
There are considerable attractions for investors and companies. Incentives
include full tax holidays until 2011 for all financial institutions, trading
and manufacturing companies setting up offshore or in the free zone. This
allows banks, for example, to offer better conditions to their customers at
no extra costs.
Foreign exchange rules have been liberalised. However, this has caused some
concern to the financial authorities in Lisbon. Accordingly, the central
bank has asked for clarification on regulations covering the operations of
Portuguese non-banking institutions which it argues should be treated under
the same tax regime as their mother companies and not as foreign companies.
The central bank would like all non-financial Portuguese companies wishing
to operate offshore to first seek the bank's approval. 'There's a hole in
the legislation on this,' a bank official says.
Several Portuguese or Madeiran companies, such as Companhia Insular de
Moinhos (CIM), a biscuit and pasta manufacturer, are moving into the free
zone to take advantage of the favourable tax regime. CIM is also using the
opportunity to restructure and modernise its production.
Requests for information have been 'pouring in', according to Mr Joao Luis
Dias, director of Dixcart Management (Madeira), a subsidiary of the Dixcart
group. He says establishment procedures have greatly improved, making it
possible to incorporate a company within a little more than two weeks.
Office space has been scarce, but supply is improving. Dixcart recently
moved into new premises while The New Madeira Investment Servicos, another
management company, prepares to make its own move. The original optimism
appears unchanged. 'The centre is well regulated and we keep standards high.
I don't have any doubts about the future,' Mr Costa says.

Standards are rising - Doing business in Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM

<TEXT>
'PORTUGAL,' quipped a Mozambican friend, 'is an African country with a
European vocation.'
The remark, neatly turning round a popular saying about Portugal's historic
links with Africa, has more than a grain of truth in it.
Life in Portugal, especially in the southern half of the country, is
tempered by a distinctly non-European nonchalance; spontaneity, a tendency
to leave decisions to the last minute and a desire to please, all mixed with
a strong streak of fatalism, seem designed to test the patience of visitors.
If you are in a hurry, Portugal is not the place for you.
If you add to that problems that result from an as yet under-developed
infrastructure, poor though improving telecommunications, and the dead
weight of a massive state bureaucracy with its over-abundant 'red tape,' it
is easy to see why business people occasionally despair they will ever get
anything done.
Portugal's ties with its former colonies in Asia, with Portuguese-speaking
Brazil and more especially with Africa, are still much in evidence.
Immigrants from Cape Verde, Angola and Mozambique make up a good proportion
of workers on building sites in and around Lisbon.
In late afternoons, the northern side of the Rossio, the capital's main
square, is animated with groups of immigrants who have made it a meeting
point to exchange gossip or simply while away the hours.
But for all these vivid reminders of Portugal's colonial past, Lisbon has
been rediscovering Europe with an official enthusiasm matched only by
generous helpings of European Community funds.
EC membership is assisting Portugal to overcome decades of neglect and
changing attitudes. Foreign investment has poured into the country helping
to modernise industries and infrastructures.
The pressure of EC integration is forcing the pace of change.
The range and quality of goods and services is improving, new businesses are
bringing more ideas and promoting the cause of efficiency. Standards of
living have risen, though wide disparities of wealth are still noticeable.
Wages are the lowest in Europe, and this has been an important attraction
for foreign investors.
While the public sector is plagued with poor industrial relations and
strikes from government bureaucrats to policemen, teachers, doctors, and
museum attendants, the private sector is practically free of strife.
Managers of multinational companies say that while local workers generally
have lower initial skills, they respond well to training and can achieve
levels of proficiency that can compete with levels elsewhere.
Housing is often sub-standard with poor safety and hygiene. There is a
serious housing shortage, but foreign executives can find better quality
accommodation in Lisbon or Oporto though at prices closer to those in other
European cities.
Office space is a problem and prices are high though after 1992 they should
stabilise as more commercial property comes on the market.
Bureaucracy and red tape are infuriating, though the right connections will
usually help speed matters, but not always.
Brush a local government official the wrong way, and the water link that you
so desperately need will be dammed at source by forms and unanswered
letters. Construction work is slow and requires constant supervision; delays
are common.
Appointments will often be changed, sometimes at the very last minute, and
few will actually start on time playing havoc with business schedules.
Minor officials can be wrong-headed and infused with an exaggerated sense of
their own importance. Service, especially in the state sector, is bad -
reflecting the fact that many state employees are poorly paid and trained.
Taxi drivers are probably among the rudest in the world and you will be
lucky to get a grunt back as an acknowledgement after you mention your
destination.
Finding a garage to park your car is difficult and expensive, but it could
save having to pay for broken windows and stolen car radios if you leave
your car in the street, even if you live in a smart part of town.
If you are planning to live outside Lisbon and drive in, travel before or
after the rush hour to avoid long jams. And always drive defensively  -
Portuguese drivers are among the worst and probably the most dangerous in
Europe, giving Portugal the highest proportion of fatal road accidents in
the Community. Insurance premiums are high.
But for all these drawbacks, there are big compensations. Apart from four
months between December and April when it can rain torrentially for days and
temperatures are low, the climate is mild, the summers long and hot, and the
beach is never very far away.
At the height of the tourist season, it is best to avoid the main resorts
along the Algarve, but there are still many places left to visit along the
coast and in the interior.
From the green hills of the Minho where vinho verde (red and white) is
produced in the north, along the Douro river and valley that runs downhill
from Spain in the east through stunning landscape to Oporto, through the
Serra da Estrela mountains in the centre, and south, across the Alentejo,
with its miles of practically-deserted beaches and torrid interior
landscape, there is plenty to delight and discover.
Portugal has much to offer those who like to live outdoors. There is a wide
choice of sea food and some good wines, and once off-duty a temporary
resident can enjoy a pleasant and relaxed lifestyle.

Step by step to private ownership - Case study, Banco Totta &amp; Acores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT happens when a state-owned bank becomes private, and how does it
prepare for the change?
For Mr Alipio Barrosa Pereira Dias, president of the Banco Totta &amp; Acores
(BTA), the first Portuguese bank to be privatised, save for about 16 per
cent remaining in state hands, privatisation was a crucial factor for the
bank's future development not just because of the change in ownership, but
because it enabled the bank to do several things that it could not do
before.
The privatisation itself took place in three separate stages: an initial
floation on the stock exchange of 49 per cent of the bank's share capital in
July 1989, followed just over a year later with the sale of anothger 31 per
cent stake.
A capital increase last December, finally brought the private shareholding
in the bank to above 84 per cent.
Despite government limits on the purchase of privatised shares by
foreigners, Banesto, the Spanish banking group, managed to build up directly
and indirectly a controlling interest in the bank.
Today, Banesto holds directly around 10 per cent of the shares, while
Valores Ibericos - a joint venture with a Portuguese partner in which it
holds 49 per cent, has another 28 per cent. Other shareholders are small and
in practice Banesto has effective control of the bank.
From the very begining, the privatisation had a dramatic impact on the bank.
First and foremost, it allowed it to strengthen its capital base and grow.
Like all Portuguese state-owned banks that were nationalised in 1975, BTA
had seen its need for fresh capital frustrated by the unwillingness of
successive governments to provide new funds.
A weak capital base was a common problem for the nationalised banks. It was
a double handicap at a time when a system of credit ceilings - established
in the late 1970s and only recently abandoned - limited the amount a bank
was allowed to lend on the basis of its capitalisation.
With expansion thus constrained, BTA had to face increasingly tough
competition from new foreign and private Portuguese banks allowed to operate
once more after an initial liberalisation of the banking system in 1984.
By 1989, the need for fresh capital had become urgent if the bank was going
to remain competitive and grow. Privatisation came just at the right moment.
'It became possible to raise the bank's capital and with more capital we
could expand our activities. This was the most important effect of
privatisation,' Mr Dias says.
Paradoxically, the credit ceilings now started to work in BTA's favour. The
state-owned banks which were denied new injections of funds from the
government could only strengthen their own capital base either by issuing
limited amounts of participation certificates, or by ploughing back into the
bank what profits the state as main shareholder would decide to leave them.
This clearly hampered their development, which was already more difficult
because of their heavy burden oif bad debts, inefficient structures and
overstaffing.
The second most important effect was to give the bank a new sense of
direction.
Mr Dias who had joined BTA in 1988, prepared a new strategic plan for the
bank aimed at modernising operations, improving research and internal
controls, increasing the number of branches, and making more efficient use
of human resources.
Staff had to be reduced and productivity raised, older employees were
retired early or retrained.
Whereas in December 1987 the bank had on average 37 employees per branch,
this is now down to 23 employees.
The total number of employees has been reduced from about 4,500 in 1988 to
4,200 today in spite of an increase in the number of branches from 127 in
February 1988 to 173 now.
Mr Dias says he expects to open up another 10 to 15 branches by the end of
this year. Productivity has risen dramatically, helped by the introduction
of new computing and software systems.
Privatisation also meant changes in the image of the bank and in the
attitude of its employees.
'Sometimes it was simple things, like employees coming to work in casual
clothes without a tie. We had to explain to them this gave the bank a bad
image. But you couldn't legislate this, you had to win their cooperation,'
he says.
Another problem was the length of the privatisation process. For a period of
months, the future of the bank and of its shareholding structure remained
uncertain. This made it especially important for the bank's management to
maintain the full confidence of both the financial authorities and of its
staff.
'It was crucial during the privatisation to make people understand the need
for the process,' Mr Dias says.
Consultations and persuasion created a better climate than edicts from above
and sackings, though some lay-offs were inevitable.
But over a year and a half after the initial part-privatisation, Mr Dias
feels he has overcome the biggest obstacles - 'now we compete on equal terms
with the private banks. By next year we'll be in a position to do much
more.'

Fragile but promising - David Waller on the stock market's development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE THE mid-eighties, the Portuguese stock market has been through an
exaggerated surge of business and endured a severe collapse. Only now, with
a package of reforms due to be put in place this summer, are optimistic
observers saying the market has calmed down after the excesses of the past
half-decade.
Six years ago, the market barely existed. There was a stock exchange, but
volume was minuscule and there had not been a rights issue since before the
1974 revolution. All this changed in 1985-1986. The minority Social Democrat
government stimulated business confidence. Portugal joined the European
Community. A bull market was born.
'The market took off in 1985-86 and carried on rising until October 1987,'
says Joao Rendeiro, managing director of Gestifundo, a Lisbon-based
securities house. 'In the run-up to the election in June 87 there was
incredible euphoria. In other countries, the bull market took 10 years to
build up. Here the whole process was concertinaed into just six months.'
From 1983 to 1987, the number of quoted companies rose from 41 to 176; the
value of share transactions rose from Esc 5.7bn (Dollars 39m) to Esc
282.4bn. The total value of securities issued on the capital markets soared.
The Banco Totta e Acores (BTA) index began 1987 at 1,220, rose to a peak of
6,812 just before the crash, but fell back to 2,990 by the end of the year.
If it took a relatively short time for Portugal to enjoy a bull market, it
has taken correspondingly longer for the market to revive after the crash.
There have been two serious attempts at rallies, but the index ended last
year at 2143.4, a fall of 34.6 per cent in local currency terms over 1990
and still well below its level at the end of 1987.
'After the crash Portuguese investors sold in panic like anywhere else,'
says Mr Rendeiro, 'but all the weaknesses of a fragile infrastructure came
to the forefront dramatically. There was a huge shift in sentiment and for
more than a year afterwards the market continued to sink downwards as
investors tried to come to grips with the mess left by October 1987.'
The post-crash problems have been psychological and structural.
Psychological, because local investors had their fingers severely burned in
October 1987 and thereafter proved reluctant to get into the market.
Structural, because of an antiquated settlement system and a lack of
liquidity in the majority of stocks, which has discouraged all but the
bravest of foreign investors.
Although the number of companies quoted on the exchanges of Lisbon and
Oporto rose from 135 to 182 between 1987 and 1990, the bulk of activity is
concentrated on a dozen liquid stocks. Just 10 stocks - including Soporcel
(a pulp and paper company), Sonae (an industrial holdings company), Radio
Marconi Portuguesa (telecommunications), Banco Comercial Portugues, and
Banco Portugues de Investimento accounted for 52 per cent of the market's
capitalisation at the end of 1990, while trading in these shares invariably
accounts for most of the average daily Dollars 5-Dollars 6m turnover.
In January this year, the government finally approved a package of reforms
meant to remedy some of the structural defects of the market. The main
features are:
The setting up of a Securities &amp; Exchange Commission as the main regulatory
and supervisory body;
The privatisation and unification of the markets in Lisbon and Oporto. The
two trading floors will remain but in future each will be managed by an
association of local brokers and dealers who will be responsible for setting
up an investors' compensation scheme;
The creation of a central depository and settlement system;
The implementation of a new paperless trading system, at first only for the
blue-chips, eventually for the market as a whole, giving investors
continuous stock prices; and rules and penalties on insider dealing,
takeovers and mergers; share manipulation and disclosure rules.
The package will be implemented in June at the earliest; preliminary reforms
were introduced earlier this year (when the two exchanges introduced a
second daily price-fixing for the most liquid stocks) and at the beginning
of this month when a new partially computerised trading system was
introduced in Lisbon.
'The initial impact of the stock market reform is difficult to assess,' says
Mari Vargas, a London-based analyst at BNP Securities, 'but it should bring
greater efficiency and liquidity to stock exchange transactions for the
benefit of investors.
'Costs are also expected to go down . . . and the major foreign
institutional investors, including the Americans, that have been reluctant
to face the difficult trading conditions should reconsider their investment
decisions.'
Foreign investors, while accounting for much of the turnover, and owning 15
per cent of the market by market capitalisation (at the end of September
1990), were net sellers in the fourth quarter of 1990.
The market's recovery in the first months of this year - up from 1986 at its
lowest point in mid-January to 2515 - is thought to be driven by domestic
investors awash with cash because of the delayed privatisation programme.
A revival of this programme in the months ahead will soak up that demand and
is likely to tempt back foreign investors who have traditionally been keen
on new issues.
As the early privatisations will be banks and insurance companies, the
market's heavy skewing towards financial services will be exacerbated: large
sectors of the economy such as property and tourism are under-represented,
while banks alone accounted for 39 per cent of the market's capitalisation
at the end of last year.
The Portuguese market is the EC's smallest stock market and last year was
the worst performer. But it gives investors the opportunity to invest in a
small but dynamic economy.
Thus, if the market is still fragile, it certainly has potential - 'for the
first time in five years, stocks and p/e ratios are in line with
international standards,' says Mr Rendeiro.
'Prices react to events and information in a normal way. For the first time
we begin to have a real market.'

LEICA camera bodies, the most expensive and prestigious in the world, are
made in Germany. But an important part of their manufacture, together with
the full production of high-precision binoculars and microscopes, is carried
out near the town of Vila Nova de Familicao in north-west Portugal.
Here, 500 employees match their German colleagues for quality and are only
marginally behind in productivity, according to Mr Wolfgang Koch, the
group's general manager for Portugal. The only difference between the
Portuguese plant and Leica's two factories near Frankfurt is that labour
costs are 65 per cent lower.
'We would not be in the market at all if it were not for our lower wage
costs in Portugal,' says Mr Koch. Leica, now owned by Cambridge Instruments
of the UK and Switzerland's Wild group, set up a subsidiary in Portugal in
1973 when the pressure of Japanese competition forced the company to choose
between cutting costs or closing down.
The Portuguese operation, Leica Aparelhos Optica de Precisao, has since
increased its workforce more than twentyfold, investing a total of Es1.5bn
(Dollars 10.6m) over the past five years.
Two new factory units were recently opened, raising the value of the
company's exports to Es3bn a year. Management is now considering negotiating
a new investment contract with the Portuguese Institute of Foreign Trade
(ICEP).
Leica's success in Portugal bears out the assertion of Mr Antonio Neto da
Silva, the secretary of state for foreign trade, that, 'allied to efficient
management and modern technology, Portuguese workers achieve productivity
and quality levels to equal the best in Europe'.
Twelve German technicians work at the Vila Nova de Familicao plant. But the
head of the quality department is Portuguese.
'They like to say he is more German than the Germans,' says Mr Koch. Local
women, who make up 60 per cent of the workforce, show particular prowess at
close precision work.
'The calibre of our workers; their willingness to learn skills and work hard
is one of the most satisfying aspects of being in Portugal,' says Mr Koch.
Low costs and high productivity such as those enjoyed by Leica are drawing
other foreign investors to Portugal in record numbers. Direct foreign
investment grew to Es509bn (Dollars 3.6bn) in 1990, a 46-per cent increase
on the previous year - the increase in dollar terms was over 60 per cent.
Most investment originated from Britain, followed by France and Spain.
German investment, in fourth place, increased more than fourfold to Es60bn.
Foreign companies already established in Portugal accounted for 56 per cent
of the total through capital increases and expansion projects.
Heavyweight projects such as the Es27.5bn investment by Continental of
Germany in a tyre manufacturing joint venture made the headlines. But only
two out of a total of 3,500 foreign investment projects went above Es10bn.
'It is the small and medium-sized foreign investments that are providing our
industrial fabric with density and critical mass,' says Mr Miguel Athayde
Marques, vice-president of ICEP.
Besides illustrating the comparative advantages that are pulling foreign
investors to Portugal, the Leica subsidiary is also a prime example of why
the government is so keen to attract them.
The high-tech, high value-added plant is set in the Vale do Ave, the most
depressed industrial region in the country, where the government estimates
45,000 jobs could be lost by 2000 as textile, clothing and footwear
companies - Portugal's principal sources of export revenue - fall victim to
increased competition.
'Investment in new areas with a high technological component is vital for
the structural adjustment of Portuguese industry and the efficient
reallocation of manpower and resources,' says Mr Athayde Marques.
The sectors pinpointed by the government as having the most potential for
investment are information technology and electronics, biotechnology and
pharmaceuticals, technical ceramics, special purpose plastics, medical
equipment, agribusiness, cars and components, equipment and machinery,
sporting goods and tourism.
Foreign investment in such areas has been highly beneficial to the
Portuguese economy over the past six years. Exports are becoming
increasingly less dependent on the labour-intensive, low value-added sectors
of clothing and shoes and moving into more technologically sophisticated
areas.
Foreign manufacturers are forming upstream links with local suppliers. Their
demanding requirements are helping to promote the upgrading of Portuguese
companies, forcing them to improve their performance in terms of
specifications, quality, and delivery times.
The benefits are also being felt in Portugal's backward agricultural sector
where productivity is less than a third of average EC levels. The Plein Sud
group of the French entrepreneur Mr Thierry Roussel recently launched the
first stage of a planned Dollars 100m investment in two large farms to
produce off-season fruit and vegetables in the southern Alentejo, and plants
and flowers in northern Portugal. Both farms use modern production and
management techniques that contrast dramatically with traditional methods.
The Lisbon government's eagerness to capture foreign investment is backed by
attractive investment incentives for projects considered to have a positive
structural impact. According to the Institute for the Support of Small and
Medium-sized Industries (IAPMEI), foreign investors account for 16 per cent
of the Es149bn that has been awarded in investment incentives since two
EC-funded grant schemes were launched at the beginning of 1989.
That percentage is likely to undergo a substantial increase if a plan by
Ford Europe and Volkwagen to invest more than Es300bn to manufacture a new
multipurpose passenger vehicle in Portugal goes ahead. Officials are waiting
for Brussels to approve finance for an incentive package reportedly worth
between Esc 100bn and Esc 130bn before finalising the project.
The Portuguese Confederation of Industry complains this will be equal to the
amount of incentives awarded to Portuguese companies over the past three
years and has called for more support for local industry.
But government officials say the amount of incentives for the
Ford/Volkswagen plant has been exaggerated. They defend the project, which
will be the largest single foreign investment ever made in Portugal, not
only for the 5,300 jobs it will create directly but for the structural
impact it will have on the economy as a whole, increasing the value of
exports with the planned production of 173,000 vehicles a year, promoting
the growth of supply industries and indirectly creating thousands of other
new jobs.

Independence strengthened - Patrick Blum discusses the central bank's
changing role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM

<TEXT>
SINCE 1984, Portugal's financial system has been through more change than
any other sector of the economy. New private banks and financial
institutions sprung up from nowhere to become leading players on the
domestic market, offering new services, using more modern methods, and
bringing fresh ideas to shake the complacency of the state-owned and
state-run banking establishment. Deregulation gradually helped open up
markets and the economy to international market forces.
Liberalisation was given a further push by European Community membership and
the need to meet requirements for financial services and institutions. By
1992, Portugal will have to comply with the bulk of EC directives on the
liberalisation of the financial system except for short-term capital
movements for which it has won a reprieve likely to last for another two to
three years.
The Banco de Portugal (central bank) which for years after the 1974
revolution had been little more than a conveyor belt for Finance Ministry
edicts has not escaped the movement for reform, winning a new, more
independent lease of life.
It is now undergoing a programme of important changes that has already
strengthened its independence and improved its operations. Mr Jose Alberto
Tavares Moreira, the bank's governor, says that within three to four years
the reform will be completed and the bank will have radically changed
structures.
'At the end of that period we'll have a structure composed of six main
departments organised on the basis of the essential functions of the bank,
compared with 19 departments when we started with the reform, and 12
departments now,' he says. The six departments will be responsible
separately for economic research, the money markets, foreign exchange
operations, banking supervision, staff and administration, and issuing
currency. Each one will have its own director.
The streamlining of functions will be accompanied with a streamlining of
staff which will be reduced from about 3,000 at the start of the reform
almost two years ago (now 2,300) to about 2,000 employees.
But at least as important for the bank are the reforms outlined in a draft
law approved last autumn enhancing its autonomy. While Portugal's central
bank will not be as independent as Germany's Bundesbank, it will be more
independent than the Bank of England or the Banque de France.
In the past, the central bank was independent only in theory. It was
described as the country's issuing bank, responsible for foreign exchange
regulations and currency management, as well as for the orientation and
control of monetary policy, but with an important proviso: that it would
carry out all these functions 'within the guidelines' established by the
Finance Ministry. And while it could give its opinion on monetary and fiscal
policy, in practice the last word always belonged to the government. The
bank was essentially an administrative, and at times, political, instrument
of government.
In what was a highly regulated financial environment the central bank acted
as a gendarme to ensure that the minutiae of economic and monetary policy
dictated by the Finance Ministry in great detail was properly enforced.
Under its new statutes, it has won far greater freedom of action and is
required to fulfil its functions 'taking into account' government policies.
It 'collaborates in defining' monetary and exchange rate policy and 'keeps a
watch over the stability of the financial system'. It advises on monetary
and financial policy, and is responsible for supervising the monetary,
financial and foreign exchange markets.
It is also no longer obliged, as in the past, to lend funds to the
government. It was not uncommon for a government suddenly pressed for cash
to ask the bank for the money. This was a convenient way for governments to
hide part of their indebtedness and raise money cheaply since interest rates
were set administratively. The bank could argue, but in practice it could
not reject a government request for credit.
The bank's management and the position of its governor have also been
strengthened and given greater responsibilities. In the past the bank's only
authority was its collective management board of which the governor was an
administrative chairman, but under the new statutes the governor's role and
authority have been enhanced.

Painful changeover - Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL is grossly under-insured by the standards of the European
Community.
According to a study conducted by Arthur Andersen, total premiums in 1989
amounted to Es220bn (USDollars 1.5bn), which works out at about 3 per cent
of GDP - less than half the EC average. Premiums per head are around
one-eighth of the level of the rest of Europe.
The opportunities for such an underdeveloped sector are enormous, especially
in view of Portuguese people's high propensity to save. Recognising this,
the number of insurance companies operating in Portugal has risen from 50 in
1986 to 65 now and an estimated 75 by the end of the year.
Like the banking sector, the insurance industry was owned and controlled by
the state until the mid-1980s. The pace of change has been slower, though,
than in banking and deregulation has in many cases brought pain rather than
prosperity.
The market is extremely concentrated - the six biggest companies account for
approximately 70 per cent of the industry. In 1986, all were state-owned; by
now one is totally private, another is in the throes of privatisation, and
three more are to be sold off by the end of next year.
Between 1984 and 1989, the state relinquished its control over tariffs in
segment after segment of the insurance market. This ushered in an era of
fierce price competition, which according to Mr Ruy de Carvalho, president
of the Portuguese Insurers' Association, lingers on still.
Thus, in sectors such as motor insurance, big-ticket industrial insurance
and workmen's compensation, premiums have fallen dramatically recently.
'After decades of control competition is now very lively,' Mr Carvalho
acknowledges.
It is in the life sector that premiums rose most comfortably last year, by
26 per cent, twice the rate of inflation. It is the life business which
offers the biggest opportunity for profitable expansion. This accounts for
only 20 per cent of the market against an average of 40 per cent across the
EC.
In total, the life market grew from Es45.5bn to 69bn over 1989-90 and the
non-life from 175.5bn to 221bn.
New companies - such as Ocidental Seguros, the insurance subsidiary of the
Banco Comercial Portugues - have tended to concentrate on life. Older ones -
like Fidelidade, Portugal's second largest insurer now owned by the giant
Caixa Geral - are scurrying to form distribution links with the banks. This
form of selling is gradually replacing the army of agents who act as
intermediaries.
Mirroring the success of its parent company in the banking sector, Ocidental
has come from nowhere to be the 14th largest insurance company. Seguros
predicts its premium income will grow by 80 per cent this year, an
indication of the vigour of the life business.
The company would occupy a higher position still if motor insurance were
stripped out. This accounts for a substantial proportion of the premium
income generated by the top six insurers but, according to Mr Joao Talone,
president of Ocidental, losses in this segment of the market amounted to
Es7bn last year.
The total profit across the sector was Es6 - 7bn last year. Talone says that
two thirds of this is not trading profit - 'the only thing the big companies
can do is cut their rates to keep market share,' he comments. 'They have
made most of their money by selling properties in the middle of a bull or by
selling shares bought long before the 1974 revolution.
'All the big insurers are engaged in window-dressing to make themselves look
good for privatisation,' he says.
'The state sector companies are hampered from doing deals with banks to
secure distribution channel for life products,' he continues. 'Nobody knows
who's going to end-up owning whom. We are selling well into our own bank
because we are part of the same culture. They have been forced to compete
very strongly without having the tools to take the necessary strategic
decisions.'
Mr Jose Antonio Santos Texeira, president of Imperio, the largest insurance
company in Portugal and yet to be privatised, rejects any suggestion that
the state sector is grossly inefficient.
He admits, however, that the company is handicapped by its public-sector
status.
Mr Texeira would like to have a bank and a large foreign insurance company
as shareholders. Rivals comment that the problem with the privatisation
programme is that the state will demand a high price for its insurance
assets, but will want control to remain in the hands of the Portuguese. The
trouble may be that only outsiders will be willing to pay the price.
Foreign interest in the sector is high: Andersen calculated that Portuguese
companies will have less than 60 per cent of the market by 1995. The main
foreign entrants are from France and Spain, and they have considerably
greater financial muscle. Ruefully, Mr Texeira says that his company's
capital amounts to Pounds 2.5m, compared to the Pounds 1bn of UAP, the
French group which has acquired Garantia, Portugal's seventh largest
insurance company, and which is poised to take control of Alianca, another
state-owned insurer - when its privatisation is finally completed.

Serious underlying problems - Although the economy appears to have performed
remarkably well, Patrick Blum discovers . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST sight Portugal's economy appears to have performed remarkably well.
Last year, the gross domestic product grew by 4.4 per cent, exports surged,
investment was up by 8.7 per cent with direct foreign investment rising by
more than 60 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn, the current account balance closed
with a hardly noticeable Dollars 61m deficit, and unemployment was below 5
per cent. Only inflation, at 13.4 per cent for the year, appeared to cloud
the horizon.
Yet, in spite of the good news which merited praise from the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European
Commission, there remain serious underlying problems of which inflation -
which officials seem at times to perceive as only a temporary difficulty
caused by too much success - is just one.
True, exports are rising, but not as much and not sufficiently fast to
overcome an enduring trade deficit. Merchandise imports have grown much
faster than exports. The value of imports of goods rose by 31.5 per cent
from Dollars 17.6bn in 1989 to Dollars 23bn last year, while the value of
exports of goods grew by a sturdy but more modest 25.2 per cent from Dollars
12.7bn in 1989 to Dollars 16.4bn. The deficit in traded goods rose by almost
35 per cent in 1990, resuming an upward trend that had been reversed in
1989.
It will not be easy to overcome this imbalance, although some important
manufacturing projects now under way will help in the future. But for the
time being, Portuguese manufactured goods tend, with few exceptions, to be
of lower quality and geared to the mass market. Inefficient production
methods are compensated for by the lowest labour costs in the Community,
Portugal's largest market. But that comparative advantage is being
increasingly eroded as competition from other EC and non-EC producers
becomes more intense, and as wages rise to come more into line with those in
the rest of Europe.
Mr Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, governor of the Banco de Portugal (central
bank), argues that the growth in exports demonstrates that Portuguese
industry is becoming more competitive: 'In spite of the strong appreciation
of the escudo we have managed to have a current account practically in
surplus. This shows that there has been a considerable restructuring of the
economy. There have been extensive productivity gains."
That is true in some industries though the extent and significance of the
restructuring is less certain. Traditional sectors such as textiles or
agriculture - the two biggest areas of activity - are deeply in crisis.
Repeated complaints about high interest rates - at between 21 per cent and
23 per cent for prime corporate clients for a year, or 24 per cent to 26 per
cent for small companies - and recurrent calls for help from Portuguese
business groups in the face of foreign competition suggest that industry
remains deeply apprehensive about the future.
The current account has improved with the latest figures for 1989 showing a
surplus of Dollars 139m instead of the forecast deficit of Dollars 550m, and
initial - likely to be revised - figures for 1990 showing a deficit of
Dollars 61m compared to a forecast deficit of Dollars 1.2bn. But this was
achieved not simply because exports grew - though that helped - but in large
part because of higher than expected earnings from tourism, up by almost 30
per cent from Dollars 2.1bn in 1989 to Dollars 2.7bn last year, and higher
emigrants remittances worth Dollars 4.2bn.
For Portugal to be able to benefit fully from European integration and
European economic and monetary union (EMU) inflation must be brought under
control and the inflation differential between Portugal and its European
partners reduced. But while inflation was brought down from its 1984 peak of
nearly 30 per cent to an annual rate of 9.4 per cent in 1987, it has edged
back up since then.
Mr Miguel Beleza, the finance minister, appointed more than a year ago, is
more cautious than his predecessor when it comes to forecasts, but his own
10.5 per cent target, later revised to 11 per cent, still fell short of the
13.4 per cent annualised average rate actually achieved - more than double
the European average.
This year, the government hopes to bring down inflation to a maximum 11 per
cent. Mr Tavares Moreira says this is feasible though it will be difficult
because of strong demand pressure. 'It is not easy to deflate an economy
under these conditions,' he says.
There are signs that price rises may have slowed a little with the
annualised average rate in February falling 0.1 of a percentage point to
13.3 per cent, but this is still a long way from the 8 per cent which he
says would be desirable to bring the escudo into the Exchange Rate Mechanism
(ERM) of the European Monetary System (EMS), a move the government would
like to make as soon as possible.
Another factor may now also be entering the inflation equation. In recent
years, wages have lagged behind rather than led inflation, but this could be
changing. An agreement last autumn between the government and some of the
unions to keep wage increases to 13.5 per cent may limit rises in the state
sector, but low unemployment and labour scarcity, especially in parts of the
private sector, is causing strong upward pressure with pay deals this year
reaching 16 per cent. Yet wages must go up if higher productivity gains are
to be achieved.
The government is caught between conflicting pressures. In the past,
interest rates were kept high administratively as part of efforts to curb
credit demand and consumption to fight inflation. Now, with moves towards
market set rates, the main and enduring cause of high interest rates remains
the budget deficit which represents between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent of
GDP. Government borrowing effectively sets the rates for the market.
Privatisations which last year brought the government an extra income of
nearly Dollars 1bn, cannot help since revenue from the sale of state-owned
assets cannot be used to finance the budget. Meanwhile, high interest rates
and a stable currency encourage capital inflows thereby adding to
inflationary pressures.
Moreover, as the economy is opened up and the financial system is
liberalised it is increasingly difficult for the authorities to control
capital movements. Short-term capital inflows proved especially troublesome
last year having increased from Dollars 770m in 1989 to Dollars 1.8bn which
represented more than one third of all capital movements in 1990. To
discourage these mainly speculative capital movements the authorities
tightened up foreign exchange rules and allowed greater fluctuations in the
value of the escudo by ending the practice of maintaining a 'crawling peg'
according to which the escudo was depreciated by 0.25 per cent a month. The
immediate effect, however, was to send the escudo up rather than down.
So those hoping for a depreciation of the escudo are unlikely to see their
wishes satisfied. 'We have to see the exchange rate level on a long-term
basis, and (on that basis) the escudo is about right at the moment,' Mr
Tavares Moreira says, adding, 'there is no alternative to maintaining a very
firm monetary policy'. And that means the squeeze between high real interest
and exchange rates is likely to continue.

Spanish banks invade - Patrick Blum records the end of an era for Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETIME soon the distinctive rich, blue colours of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
(BBV), Spain's biggest banking group, will be hoisted on to the front of the
modern headquarters of Lloyds Bank Portugal on Lisbon's busy Avenida da
Liberdade.
The occasion will mark the end of an era for the British bank which put down
its first roots in Portugal in 1865 as the Anglo Portuguese Bank, later
transformed into the Bank of London and South America, and which has
operated under its present name since the 1970s.
One of the few banks to escape the 1975 revolution's sweeping
nationalisations, Lloyds kept and developed a small but highly profitable
business niche in the country.
When the bank's sale to BBV for Pounds 110m is approved by the Portuguese
authorities, it will also highlight the recent inroads made by Spanish banks
into the Portuguese market. It is not quite a flood, but it is already a
good deal more than a trickle.
Apart from BBV, Banesto has bought a leading stake in Banco Totta &amp; Acores
(BTA), Banco Santander has a substantial share of Banco de Comercio e
Industria (BCI), and Banco Exterior de Espana has a main branch in Lisbon
and plans to open several more branches this year.
Furthermore, Banco Hispano Americano is waiting for authorisation to
transform its Portuguese investment company into a bank, Banco Central has a
representative office and a standing request for a branch and several
regional savings banks have representations in Portugal.
All this, of course, excludes specialised investment, leasing and real
estate companies.
But whereas most Spanish banks chose either to build up their stakes
gradually in local institutions as Banesto has done through BTA's
privatisation or start from scratch with an investment or fund management
company, BBV has taken a different route by buying up an existing private
bank with a small but well-established network of a dozen branches.
It was an unexpected move, but one which fitted the Spanish group's
strategy. Mr Gonzalo Terreros, BBV international manager, says the bank
wanted to be in the Portuguese market to offer universal banking services
with an emphasis on corporate and private banking.
He sees Portugal as a rapidly expanding market with reactions similar to the
Spanish market in the early 1980s.
'Spain and Portugal are the fastest growing areas in Europe,' he says.
Lloyds was chosen after a study of various other possibilities including
that of buying a bank that was being privatised. This was discarded as too
slow, too uncertain, and as a potential source of conflict with the
Portuguese authorities.
BBV wanted to avoid the controversy that surrounded Banesto's move into BTA
as well as the need to have to negotiate with too many diversified
shareholders.
At the same time it was not seeking a commercial bank with a large branch
network. For size and nature of its business Lloyds fitted BBV's ambitions.
Calculating that Lloyds which had been cutting back on its international
operations may be willing to sell, BBV approached the bank and was able to
clinch a deal within a relatively short time.
'We were sure that the bank would be healthy, productive and without bad
surprises. So the Lloyds trademark was a guarantee,' Mr Terreros said.
Another of the bank's assets with BBV was that although Lloyds was not a
typical retail bank, it had a network of branches and operated in all BBV's
target markets: wholesale and retail banking with a good corporate customer
base in the state and private sectors, among medium and small companies, and
with a solid private clientele of high net worth individuals.
Since 1986, Lloyds has more than doubled its total assets which where valued
at Es87.3bn at the end of last year with profits of Es1.2bn.
Once it is authorised to transform the bank into a 100 per cent BBV-owned
Portuguese subsidiary it intends to build on the bank's present strengths
and seek to capture a greater chunk of the market among small and
medium-size companies and among private customers.
'We think we will be able to develop immediately new products, new customers
and markets, and compete with highly attractive products in those parts of
the market that are growing very fast,' Mr Terreros says.
Plans are to increase the number of branches to around 35 within 18 months.
In the longer-term, the goal is to establish BBV as an important Portuguese
bank with 'a Portuguese team and character, not a marginal foreign bank'.

Preparing for turbulence - The Banking Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past five years the Portuguese banking sector has risen swiftly from
a very low base. The question troubling bankers now is whether the growth
can continue in the years to come.
'There have been five terrific years of banking,' reflects Mr Carlos
Rodrigues, president of Manufacturers Hanover (Portugal). Margins have been
high, competition from the state-owned banks - which even after the latest
privatisations account for 75 per cent of the sector - less than vigorous.
Up until earlier this year, the financial authorities maintained a strict
credit ceiling on bank lending. According to Mr Timothy Bradbury, managing
director of Lloyds Bank, Portugal (recently bought by BBV, Spain's largest
bank), this meant that corporate customers 'were competing to borrow. In the
meantime, the private banks could buy liquidity from the public banks and
lend it out under their own credit ceiling.'
Even now, savers are paid 14-15 per cent on their deposits, subject to 20
per cent withholding tax, which works out at less than inflation. Banks then
lend out the funds at 26 per cent retail and 22 per cent wholesale. With
such handsome margins, it is not surprising that the banks have prospered.
The growth of the sector as a whole is captured in the extraordinary story
of Banco Comercial Portugues. When the bank started in 1986, it had 205
shareholders, capital of Esc 3.5bn and 255 employees. Now it has nearly
25,000 shareholders, capital of Esc 66bn and it employs 2,500 people.
There is more turnover in BCP shares on the Lisbon stock exchange than in
any other company's shares. Coming from nowhere five years ago, BCP is now
one of Europe's top 100 banks in terms of capital strength and one of the 60
largest in terms of market capitalisation.
The banking industry today cannot be understood without remembering that in
1975 all Portuguese banks were nationalised. It was not until ten years
later that the government promoted legislation allowing private banks to be
set up. The first stage of deregulation drew six foreign banks into Portugal
within 18 months, and local entrepreneurs founded four banks, of which BCP
is the best-known.
This sudden influx of competition had a profound effect on the sleepy public
sector banks. They were exposed as not merely grossly inefficient by
European standards - they had more employees per branch than any other
European country and fell behind by all other yardsticks  - but downright
insolvent.
'Throughout the 1970s and early '80s, we had a social role and we were not
driven by normal financial and economic goals,' reflects Mr Pedro Rebelo de
Sousa, president of the Banco Fonsecas &amp; Burnay, a state-owned bank which is
hoping to be privatised later this year. By the mid-1980s, the consequences
of this uncommercial approach were clear: the average percentage of bad
credit to total loan portfolios among the state-owned banks had climbed to
20 per cent.
'Many of the borrowers simply didn't exist,' quips one banker. Add-in
unfunded pension liabilities and dubious accounting policies and the result
was most of the state-owned banks were insolvent.
The reaction of Fonsecas to the new environment is typical of that of the
whole state-owned sector. It shrunk its staff by 25 per cent. It shored up
its balance sheet by selling off properties amid a bull market for real
estate. It sorted out its provisions for bad debts and unfunded pension
liabilities. It has invested heavily in information technology.
Fonsecas now considers that it is virtually indistinguishable from
Portugal's private-sector banks. a feeling shared by the large state sector
banks such as Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa, which is also
hoping to be privatised later this year. The tidying up process completed,
these banks like to think of the state as just another shareholder.
In this vein, Mr Alipio Dias, president of the Banco Totta &amp; Acores, in
which the government retains a residual 15 per cent holding, says 'the
treasury is a shareholder like any other.' According to Mr Alexandre Vaz
Pinto, president of the Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa and the
chairman of the Portuguese Bankers' Association, the average percentage of
bad debts to loan portfolio is down to 14 per cent across the state-owned
sector.
More recently, the public and partially-public banks have shared in the
general prosperity of the sector. For example, the 85 per cent privatised
Banco Totta reported a 76 per cent increase in cash flow last and assets
were up 33 per cent, with profits rising from Esc 73m in 1985 to 3.26bn in
1989. This year the rise in cash flows will be less, but lower provisions
will mean that net profits rise by as much as 50 per cent.
The pattern is repeated at Caixa Geral de Depositos, the gargantuan
state-sector bank which on its own has 25-30 per cent of the Portuguese
banking market, a fact easy to understand when one considers that it has
8.5m customers out of a population of 10.5bn. Here, profits have risen from
Esc 8.9bn in 1984 to Esc 29.9bn in 1989, with cash flows rising from Esc
15.5bn to Esc 82.2bn.
Caixa, which will never leave the public sector, is planning an aggressive
branch-opening programme, and aims to increase its branches from 420 to 500
by the end of next year. Caixa is not alone in expanding its branch network
 -all the other banks are doing it too. This is but one symptom of
increasing competition in the banking sector.
The government has yet to deregulate its rules forbidding banks to offer
interest-bearing current accounts at anything paying anything other than
nominal rates. But relaxation of this rule is expected sooner or later.
Another factor behind the increasing competition is the presence of foreign
banks - in particular Spanish banks eager to repeat in Portugal the success
they have had on domestic territory. More significant, though, is the recent
abolition of the credit ceiling. This frees the banks' lending capacity.
Combined with increased competition in the market for retail deposits, it is
inevitable that banks' spreads and profit margins will narrow.
'When we were founded we realised we only had a limited time to reach a
certain dimension,' reflects Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, President of BCP.
'In 1985, we calculated that we wouldn't face intense competition for 5-7
years and that we could reach a certain market share by launching innovative
products and introducing new technology. We were were always clear that in
1992 and afterwards there would be intense competition from foreign and
domestic private banks.'
Competition from foreign banks will be restrained for as long as the
government keep in place its restrictions on short term capital flows.
Looking ahead, one banker reflects that the days of easy money are over  -
'it's going to be war out there,' he said, 'and it's going to be bloody.'

Tougher days ahead - As Portugal faces increasing political and economic
change, the time of easy successes for the financial community is over,
reports Patrick Blum. The sector is experiencing stronger competition from
abroad and further restructuring is needed
</HEADLINE>

Lisbon waterfront, the Finance Ministry, Stock Exchange and several
government departments are located in this area of the city. Lisbon is also
Portugal's chief port and lies on the right bamk of the Tagua River, 13 kms
from the river's entry into the Atlantic Ocean, at the westernmost fringe of
the European continent. Portugal's main towns and cities include Oporto,
Setubal, Colombra and Brage. Pictured below, Lisbon's main square, the Praca
do Comercio.
THIS YEAR is likely to go by unusually quickly for Portugal. First, it is
having to speed up the pace of reform to meet next year's European Community
deadlines for the internal market. It must prepare also for its first EC
presidency starting on January 1 - exactly six years after it joined the
Community.
Before that, a general election, due by October at the latest, will decide
whether Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister and leader of the ruling
Social Democratic party, remains in power for a third term of government.
At stake will be a particular model and style of government whose
achievements and shortcomings are likely to come under close scrutiny in the
run-up to the election.
The result of the vote cannot be forecast, but the tenant at the Sao Bento
prime ministerial residence will have his work cut out. Economic pressures
are building up in spite of some striking successes.
In the years that followed its accession to the Community, Portugal
benefited from propitious domestic circumstances, a favourable international
environment and considerable goodwill and assistance to help it modernise
and catch up with its European partners.
But it is still a relatively poor country, and after five years of rapid
growth and development, new problems have emerged and some old ones are
re-asserting themselves with a vengeance.
The good news is that Portugal continued to grow at a faster rate than any
of its European partners last year with the gross domestic product rising by
4.4 per cent. Investment, up by more than 8 per cent, remained sturdy, and
foreign investment rising by over 60 per cent was buoyant. Official
unemployment was negligible and industrial activity high. The current
account was almost balanced.
The bad news is that inflation at 13.4 per cent - more than twice the EC
average - resisted official efforts to bring it down.
The budget deficit at close to 7 per cent of GDP is proving equally
difficult to reduce, and it is keeping interest rates at punishingly high
levels squeezing industry. Traditional sectors from agriculture to textiles
are inefficient and facing their most serious crisis yet.
In the past few years, the government has carried out or began several
important reforms. A land reform has opened the way for privatising the
large collective farms, the gradual privatisation of companies nationalised
in 1975 and 1976 has started to reduce the weight of the public sector in
the economy, new labour laws have relaxed some of the rigidities of the
labour market and eased conditions for dismissals, a tax reform has made tax
collection more efficient, and the financial sector has seen the most
extensive liberalisation and deregulation of all, spurred along by the need
to meet the approaching 1992 deadline for an EC-wide internal market in
financial services. But there is still much to be done.
Mr Rui Machete, past minister in several governments, former president of
the Social Democratic party and the chairman of the parliament's budget,
finance and planning committee, identifies four areas in need of fundamental
structural change: agriculture, industry, social welfare and education.
Portuguese agriculture employs about 19 per cent of the active population
but accounts for only six per cent of gross domestic product. Fewer than 15
years ago, Portugal's population was predominantly rural, yet it cannot feed
itself and depends for more than half of its food on imports.
Part of the problem is due to an excessive division of the land into a
plethora of tiny unviable plots, mainly in the north, and inefficient huge
co-operative farms created after the revolution, mainly in the south.
Productivity is among the lowest in the EC and most farmers survive thanks
to generous subsidies. Mr Machete says the land structure and the system of
agricultural price subsidies will have to change, though he expects it will
take several years of transition.
Industry also faces the challenge of the internal market. Most Portuguese
companies remain unprepared for the inevitable increase in competition after
1992, and continue to rely on old production methods, low wages, and
outdated management methods. There are exceptions, and larger companies,
many of them foreign or with international links or partners, find they can
achieve productivity levels comparable to those in other European countries.
In contrast to the growing apprehension of some Portuguese business groups,
foreign investors exude optimism, seeing in Portugal's relative backwardness
the springboard for sustained and dynamic development.
In the long run, foreign investment can have a ripple effect throughout the
economy, encouraging the development of local suppliers and helping to raise
quality standards, but the adaptation will be difficult. A large number of
small and medium-size companies will face a straightforward choice:
modernise or close - many will probably have to close. Industrial
restructuring will inevitably lead to job losses which will have to be
alleviated through a more efficient and expanded social security system
since it will not be possible to retrain all displaced workers.
Education is in a sorry state. Teachers are underpaid, career conditions
unattractive and schools and colleges plagued with recurring strikes.
Illiteracy at anything between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the
population, depending on the statistics, is still widespread and educational
standards are generally low. As old industries give way to new ones or
modernise, training and retraining have become more important. The EC is
helping through its social fund to finance training in private industry. But
as Portugal prepares for the future, education will need greater resources
with more emphasis placed on quality.
Reducing the weight of the state in the economy is another huge task. In
economic terms, the state accounts for nearly 40 per cent of GDP, but its
weight in particular sectors is overwhelming. In the financial sector, it
still controls about 80 per cent of the market. Once the privatisation
programme is completed, the two big financial groups remaining in state
hands together will have between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the market.
Privatisations are a key element in the government's strategy to reduce the
weight of the state and open the economy to market forces, but the process
has been slow and prone to delays.
Conditions are less favourable now than they were 18 months or a year ago,
investors have become more wary especially since share prices of privatised
companies have tended to fall below their original, often high, selling
price. This may not matter too much for big domestic or foreign groups whose
objective is to win market positions, but it has shaken the confidence of
smaller investors.
Diminishing the size of the state is only part of a wider need to reduce
bureaucracy and bureaucratic interference.
'There is an enormous bureaucracy run by incompetent people who interfere in
too many areas and in excessive detail,' says a senior businessman airing a
common complaint. Political parties and trade unions which should
counter-balance the state, often operate as if they were state institutions,
making it difficult at times to dissociate administrative from political
decisions.
'We've progressed and reached a higher stage of problems and issues to deal
with,' Mr Machete says. Some of the government's critics are less charitable
and argue it has wasted a unique opportunity since it had a free hand with
an absolute majority in parliament.
The truth probably lies somewhere in between: quite a lot has been achieved
but a lot more could have been done. Given the scale of the challenge, the
task of restructuring the economy and the state may have only barely began,
but the process will have to be accelerated if Portugal is to develop into a
modern and competitive economy.

FT  23 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HINT of a weak performance on Wall Street sent UK stock index futures
scurrying lower yesterday and dragged the share market down in its wake.
A dearth of buyers initially left the London market vulnerable to
profit-taking. It then only took suggestions of a decline on Wall Street to
send equity futures still lower.
Brokers said the lack of buying made it difficult to execute even the small
number of institutional sell orders placed with them. Instead, turnover was
dominated by market professionals and securities houses.
There was also interest in FT-SE 100 index options, with some investors
short of futures buying April calls and others buying puts and selling
calls, all of which are deals that assume the equity market will weaken
further.
The June FT-SE futures contract traded for much of the session just 20
points above the spot index, compared with the 30-point premium brokers
estimate is necessary to take account of future dividend payments and
financing cost.
June FT-SE closed at 2,511, down 33 points on the day and 17 points above
the spot index.
Hanson August 220 and 240 calls were actively traded as investors in the
recent Euro- bond issue continued to sell calls as a hedging trade against
the bonds.
GEC August 200 puts were a busy contract as a large technical trade was
executed.

FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Weaker yen and bond
prices prompt profit-taking
</HEADLINE>

THE WEAKER yen and lower bond prices brought profit-taking by investment
trusts yesterday, but overall trading remained dull, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
Volume fell to 250m shares, dropping below 300m for the first time since
February 4. The Nikkei average, which lost 256.93 on Friday, fell a further
304.96 to 26,237.01, the day's low in spite of sporadic buying by
arbitrageurs. The index opened at the session's high of 26,492.45.
Declines overwhelmed rises by 818 to 164, with 151 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks fell 22.54 to 1,975.53, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 3.19 to 1,489.05.
Traders said the only activity of note was small-lot, short-term trading. Mr
Bill Wilder, director of research at Schroder Securities, said domestic
institutions were uncertain of the central bank's interest rate scenario due
to the weak yen. 'The market could be in the doldrums for another three
weeks, since the earliest possibility of a discount rate cut will be
mid-May,' he added.
The smaller markets, which attracted investors looking for quick profits
last week, retreated on profit-taking. The second section slipped 8.76 to
3,396.12 and the over-the-counter market fell 30.53 to 3,065.53.
Interest rate-sensitive issues also declined on profit-taking, with Nippon
Steel shedding Y9 to Y471. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y19,000 to
Y991,000, falling below the important Y1m level for the first time since
February 15.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries receded Y12 to Y771 on reports that it had
decided to write off Y30bn worth of bills receivable that are due from Iraq.
Chiyoda, the plant engineer, dipped Y30 to Y3,030 on profit-taking after
rising for the last three days.
Nihon Nohyaku, an agro-chemical manufacturer, rose Y70 to Y2,320 in heavy
trading. Some investors were attracted by rumours that speculative buying
has boosted the issue recently. Demand spread throughout the sector, with
Kumiai Chemical adding Y40 at Y1,200 and Hokko Chemical Y50 at Y1,240.
Securities houses weakened on concern that poor market conditions would
affect earnings. Daiwa Securities fell Y60 to Y1,350 and Nomura Securities
Y30 to Y2,140.
The land transportation sector was the worst performer of the day, losing
4.03 per cent. Traders attributed the weakness to the decline of Seino
Transport, which retreated Y150 to Y2,250 on selling by foreigners.
Medical equipment makers improved on reports of new requirements stipulating
that ambulances would have to carry electro-cardiographic equipment. Nihon
Kohden gained Y10 to Y1,430.
Iwasaki Electronics, a lamp maker, gained ground in the morning on reports
that it has developed an ultra-violet ray lamp which decomposes harmful
substances in pesticides used on golf courses, but closed unchanged at
Y1,260 on profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 342.44 to 29,557.25 on volume of 21.4m
shares, down from Friday's 33.7m.
Roundup
A MIXED DAY for equities in the region emphasised the old saying that what
goes up must come down, with Hong Kong and Manila as the illustrations.
HONG KONG lost 2.3 per cent in heavy trading, but the 84.91 fall to 3,582.49
in the Hang Seng index, its lowest close in seven weeks, still left it
nearly 45 points above the day's low of 3,538. Turnover rose from HKDollars
1.22bn to HKDollars 1.41bn.
Dealers said London institutions were taking profits on currency, as well as
on the market. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the ascending US dollar;
but support for the Hang Seng was lost after Mr Douglas Hurd, the British
foreign secretary, failed to secure an agreement from China on the colony's
HKDollars 100bn international airport plan earlier this month.
MANILA's downswing accelerated with a drop of 4.1 per cent, the composite
index sliding 44.38 to 1,027.12. Some observers blamed last week's Supreme
Court ruling which allowed industrialist Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, a close
associate of the late Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos, to vote his
sequestered shares in San Miguel, the brewer and market leader.
Turnover fell from 142.9m pesos to 95.9m. San Miguel declined 5.50 pesos to
52.50.
TAIWAN, in contrast, set a 10-month high in modest trading as an historic
political reform package was passed. The weighted index advanced 69.91 or
1.2 per cent to 5,824.00.
The index has climbed 510.69 or 9.6 per cent since last Wednesday. However,
turnover continued to dwindle yesterday, falling from TDollars 76.7bn to
TDollars 69.7bn.
JAKARTA, which has been criticised for not doing enough to protect
investors, tightened disclosure regulations for companies hoping to list on
the market. The official index, meanwhile, celebrated its return from a
week's holiday by rising 3.07 to 415.55 in heavy volume of 5.83m shares.

FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Mexico in pole position yet again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET's historic breach of the 3,000 level changed the direction of
the FT-Actuaries World Index last week. Overall, it rose 0.3 per cent in
local currency terms. Excluding the US, the world was 0.1 per cent lower.
Japan held the world back in spite of reports in midweek that the central
bank was loosening its monetary policy. Speculation of an early cut in
interest rates was fanned by last Friday's release of better than expected
March money supply figures.
From a technical standpoint the Nikkei average was unable to break
decisively through the important 27,000 mark. Without Japan the world index
would have risen 0.7 per cent last week.
The best performer of the week and of the year to date was Mexico, which put
on 9.5 per cent and 62 per cent respectively in local currency terms. Mr
Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton of Baring Securities attributed the advance to
unabated buying of shares in Telmex, the telephone monopoly and a rise in
foreign investment on optimism that the Free Trade Agreement between the US
and Mexico will succeed.
The government is due to make an international offering of its remaining
Telmex shares next week, expected to raise over Dollars 2bn. Telmex has
risen over 50 per cent to over Dollars 3 in the last month and now accounts
for one-fifth of average daily market volume of Dollars 32m. However, it
showed signs of tiring last Friday, which could herald a much-needed rest
for the market, Mr Campbell-Lamerton says.
Interest rates continued to steer most stock markets last week. Hopes of an
early cut boosted Australia 5.1 per cent and New Zealand 4.4 per cent in
local currency terms, while receding hopes of a reduction cost France a fall
of 1.5 per cent and rising domestic rates left Sweden 2.2 per cent lower.
Hong Kong lost 1.7 per cent on worries about the new airport project
following the stalemate in negotiations between the UK and China.

FT  23 APR 91 / Money Markets: London rates firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS OF a sharp rise in March UK retail sales pushed interest rates higher
on the London money market yesterday. Dealers expected a very small increase
of about 0.1 per cent, and were concerned that March sales rose 3.7 per cent
after falling marginally in February.
The authorities said retail demand was boosted by buying ahead of VAT
increases, announced in the Budget on March 19, but not effective until
April 1. Nevertheless the market is concerned that the figure may delay
further cuts in UK bank base rates. Three-month sterling interbank rose to
11 7/8 -11 3/4 from 11 25/32 -11 21/32 per cent and 12-month money firmed to
11 7/16 -11 5/16 from 11 3/8 -11 1/4 per cent.
On Liffe short sterling futures weakened following the retail sales news.
June delivery opened at 88.69 and fell to a low of 88.63 before closing at
88.64 compared with 88.71 previously.
Day-to-day credit was in short supply on the cash market. The Bank of
England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m, but revised this to
Pounds 1,100m at noon and to Pounds 1,050m in the afternoon. Total
assistance of Pounds 875m was provided.
An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought
Pounds 161m bills outright, by way of Pounds 23m bank bills in band 1 at 11
7/8 per cent and Pounds 138m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
Before lunch another Pounds 153m bills were purchased, via Pounds 45m bank
bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 108m bank bills in band 2 at
11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon Pounds 561m bills were bought, through
Pounds 81m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent, Pounds 42m Treasury
bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent and Pounds 438m bank bills in band 2 at
11 13/16 per cent.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 949m, with exchequer transactions absorbing
Pounds 250m and bank balances below target Pounds 270m. These outweighed a
fall in the note circulation adding Pounds 570m to liquidity.
In Frankfurt call money rose to 8.85 from 8.80 per cent in response to
Friday's warnings by top Bundesbank officials that German monetary policy
will stay tight.
Dealers said they expect call money to remain just below the 9 per cent
Lombard rate, but are waiting for further guidance from the terms of this
week's securities repurchase agreement tender.

FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Amax optimistic of a bright
outlook for aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM'S OUTLOOK remains exceptionally bright, in spite of the present
very low prices, according to Mr Alan Born, chairman of Amax, the
third-largest US aluminium producer.
He told London analysts and institutional investors that he predicted the
market would be about balanced - as long as there is no sharp deterioration
in economic growth in Europe or Japan. His view contrasts with that of most
analysts who expect a supply surplus this year.
Mr Born admitted that very few of the west's aluminium smelters were
profitable at today's prices. 'But we think the market is at or near the
bottom of the current price cycle,' he said.
Market sentiment had not been helped by the delivery to the west of about
100,000 tonnes of aluminium from the Soviet Union in the past 30 days.
Aluminium for immediate delivery closed at 62.79 cents a lb on the London
Metal Exchange last night. Mr Born suggested 80 to 85 cents a lb was more
likely to be a sustainable price.
The highest-cost smelters were in Europe and cuts would probably come in
this region, he pointed out. Some of the older smelters in North America,
which were benefiting from power contracts related to aluminium prices,
might close as their power contracts came up for renegotiation.
Amax estimated that primary aluminium demand would rise from 14.6m tonnes
this year to 16.2m tonnes in 1995. This forecast indicated that a new
200,000-tonne smelter was required every second year, Mr Born said. But he
added: 'I don't see that happening. Not enough new smelters are being
built.'
The group had enough faith in its forecasts to invest heavily in new primary
aluminium capacity. It had a 25 per cent interest in the recently-completed
expansion of the Becancour smelter in Quebec and was constructing a
USDollars 1bn, wholly-owned smelter at Deschambault, also in Quebec.
Together these projects would add about 50 per cent to Amax's primary
aluminium capacity, taking it to an annual 750,000 tonnes. About 20 per cent
of this would be surplus to Amax's own requirements. More than two-thirds of
Amax's capacity by 1992 would be based on hydro-electric power, up from just
over 49 per cent at present, and would put its costs 'among the lowest of
the low.'
Amax also expected to go ahead with the proposed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 588m)
Antlantal smelter in Iceland in which it would have a 40 per cent interest.
Mr Paul Drack, president of Alumax, the group's aluminium subsidiary, said
negotiations about power contracts for the Iceland project were almost
completed but capital costs needed to be trimmed and government permission
to use foreign workers would be required. He hoped the Iceland smelter could
be operating in 1995.

Brightest and good medium teas showed some irregularity but were mostly
fully firm to dearer. Plainer mediums were barely steady. Coloury Tanzanians
and the better Central Africans attracted increased competition at firm to

convertible

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAYERISCHE Hypotheken und Wechsel-Bank, the smaller of Bavaria's two leading
banks, is increasing its capital by an issue of DM500m worth of convertible
participating certificates.
The certificates give investors a share of the profits, but do not carry
voting rights. Under German banking law, they count as risk but not core
capital, and under future EC guidelines will be classed as tier two
supplementary capital.
The bank is boosting its capital reserves after a year of rapid credit
expansion in all areas, including in east Germany.
The participating certificates are being offered, at a price yet to be
fixed, to holders of shares and to holders of warrants in the ratio of 39
shares or 39 warrants for one convertible participating certificate with a
face value of DM1,000.
The certificates mature at the end of 2001 and pay a coupon of 9.25 per
cent. Investors have the option to convert one certificate into 3 shares in
the period June to December from 1992 to 1999.
Spain's Banco Hispano Americano and Commerzbank of Germany have agreed to
open a joint offshore banking operation in Gibraltar. The bank, to be called
Hispano Commerzbank, will begin operations with Pta1bn in start-up capital.

NORWAY'S Norske Skog, one of Scandinavia's biggest pulp and paper producers,
plans to issue a convertible bond in the range of NKr550m to NKr700m, with
maturity on December 31, 2000.
The proposal will be made at the company's annual general meeting on May 14.
The bond will be convertible into B shares.
The issue is the last phase of a NKr6bn financing programme which was
initiated in 1990 when a NKr500m convertible bond was launched.
Norske Skog said that the new issue will be aimed at international capital
markets and placed with a selected number of investors.
To retain flexibility in fixing the terms, a framework for the new issue has
been decided. The final proposal will cover the conversion premium, coupon,
subscription period and payment date.
The placement is scheduled for the period between May 6 and May 15, if the
convertible bond is approved at the annual general meeting.
Topdanmark, the Danish banking and insurance group, said its banking unit
Aktivbanken will take over Sydfyns Discontobank as part of its strategy of
building a nationwide financial services network. Sydfyns' end-1990 balance
sheet total was DKr1.1bn.

FT  23 APR 91 / FT Conference (European Securities Markets in the 1990s):
Securities chiefs split as deadline looms - Ahead of next month's Athens
meeting which aims to approve a pan-European stock market trading system,
the views of industry leaders are polarised, reports Richard Waters.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SENIOR officials of the largest stock markets in the European Community
still have markedly different ambitions for a proposed system to support
cross-border share trading, just one month before they are due to reach
agreement on the system's final form.
Speaking in London yesterday at a conference on the development of the
European securities industries, officials from Germany, France and the UK
seemed as far apart as ever on the future for securities trading in Europe.
Yet at a meeting in Athens in a month's time, they and other EC exchanges
hope to agree the development of Euroquote, a network which could form the
basis for cross-border share trading.
Mr Rudiger von Rosen, executive vice-chairman of the Federation of German
Stock Exchanges, said that there is no demand in Germany for Euroquote to
act as a pure information system - the planned first phase of the
development. Instead, he said, 'the obvious need remains for a European
settlement system'.
Mr Jean-Francois Theodore, chairman and chief executive of the Paris Bourse,
did not specifically address the question of Euroquote in his speech, but
later said that the system was not a necessary part of cross-border share
trading. Commercial information suppliers could disseminate information just
as effectively, he said.
Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive of London's International Stock Exchange,
said that to be useful, Euroquote should carry regulated company news -
something that only two of the 12 EC exchanges could currently provide about
companies they listed. He added: 'We are sceptical about the development of
Euroquote into any (as yet wholly undefined) kind of trading or settlement
system . . . We must first decide what it is that Europe's markets need.'
Mr Patrick Gifford, a director of Fleming Investment Management, challenged
many of the assumptions made by the exchanges when he said that, for an
investor, the current fragmented European markets offered greater
opportunities than would exist in a single, efficient, transparent market.
Instead, he called for cheaper settlement costs and changes that would make
the job of fund managers easier. These include a common settlement period in
all markets, to make international switching easier, and more information
from exchanges about corporate actions like the timing of dividend payments.
Differences also arose over the regulation of cross-border share trading.
The EC hopes by June to agree an Investment Services Directive to regulate
securities business, but this has so far foundered on strong differences of
principle.
Mr Theodore said that cross-border share trading would develop through
co-operation between existing national markets, each of which would remain
the main centre of liquidity in its own domestic shares. What was needed was
high standards of transparency and listing requirements on each market.
He defended the view that this should be extended to all equity markets,
including wholesale markets developed for professional investors, such as
SEAQ International in London. 'Investors need some sort of price
transparency, whatever the market they are dealing on,' he said.
Mr Rawlins, though, argued against imposing a common level of price
transparency, adding that such ideas 'could drive business away from
regulated markets or, indeed, drive it away from Europe altogether.'
Mr Geoffrey Fitchew, director general of the EC directorate for financial
institutions and company law, laid out the terms of the EC's planned
compromise. He said that investors should be able to give a blanket
authorisation to intermediaries to deal off-exchange on their behalf, and
that it should be left to member states to decide whether and when the
details of transactions are published, provided they are all reported to a
market authority.
Mr Jeffrey Knight, conference chairman and a special adviser to the
Federation of Stock Exchanges in the EC, said Europe's various securities
markets would inevitably grow closer.
'The question is not whether markets will become integrated, but how,' he
said.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Brazil warms to overseas
mediums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN-issued medium-term notes have become one of the hottest corporate
finance tools in Brazil this year, as tight credit and high inflation at
home force companies to look abroad for funds.
Brazilian companies have so far issued Dollars 620m of medium-term notes
overseas in 1991.
The product is officially known as 'commercial paper'. But because it must
be placed at maturities of at least two years, bears more resemblance to
medium-term notes.
Brazilian banks have been quick to take advantage of the change in rules.
Banco Frances e Brasileiro (BFB), an associate of Credit Lyonnais, has
issued Dollars 100m during the past few months, and is currently negotiating
another Dollars 100m issue. Credibanco has made a Dollars 100m placement and
Banco Real Dollars 20m.
'The product has given us an important new option in obtaining medium-term
financing,' said Mr Ruy Raya, head of commercial-paper issues at BFB.
'Inflation is still so high here that it is extremely difficult to obtain
funds with maturation more than a few months out.'
One of the main attractions of medium-term notes is their tax-exempt status.
This allows multi-national companies to use the product to replace
inter-company loans, which are fully taxed.
The success of this product contrasts sharply with domestic commercial paper
issues which have failed to catch investors' imaginations. Since the product
came on the market in November last year, not a single issue has been made.
According to a spokesman for the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios (CVM),
Brazil's stock market watchdog, this is because a flat tax of 0.64 per cent
of the total value of the issue has proved prohibitively expensive.
The issuing group must be registered with the CVM, itself a costly process.
Domestically issued commercial paper also carries a maximum maturity of six
months, a term unappealing to companies in dire need of longer-term funds.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Capital Markets (International Bonds): Spain
issue could spark Ecu primary sector revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ecu bond market, which has been subdued for the last month or so, looks
set to revive, as the Kingdom of Spain prepares an Ecu750m-Ecu1bn issue of
registered bonds. However, dealers say there is an overhang of paper from
the deluge of issues earlier in the year.
Banesto will lead manage the issue, which may emerge later this week.
Spain's debut in the Ecu market a year ago, an Ecu500m offering due 1995,
has performed strongly and is yielding 9.08 per cent, a relatively expensive
level compared with other secondary market issues.
An intensive marketing campaign in Spain will seek to encourage domestic
participation, which ran at around 5 per cent for the last issue. On the
face of it, Spanish investors have little incentive to buy Ecu bonds
yielding 9 per cent or so, when Spanish government bonds denominated in
pesetas yield more than 12 per cent and carry no foreign exchange risk.
However, the peseta is expected to weaken against the Ecu over the medium-
to long-term, so domestic investors' returns may be enhanced by currency
gains.
In addition, Banesto will again be offering Ecu bank accounts to retail
investors.
Nevertheless, despite its domestic, registered structure, the deal will be
mainly placed internationally, and will trade like a Eurobond. The issue,
which will not be swapped, is expected to be attractively priced, given its
political purpose.
The maturity and size of the issue could be fixed later today, once the
extent of institutional interest in the French Treasury's offer to exchange
an outstanding six-year Ecu bond issue for longer-dated bonds has been
gauged.
In the Australian dollar market, the State Electricity Commission of
Victoria launched an ADollars 100m 10-year deal. The borrower's outstanding
debt is currently under review by Moody's for possible downgrade from
Double-A1. However, the pricing took account of any uncertainty, dealers
said. They added that investors know Australian states (the borrower is
guaranteed by the State of Victoria) are declining credits. In the
equity-linked sector, Unitika, a Japanese textile manufacturer, launched a
Dollars 110m four-year deal, quoted at a premium of three points to its par
issue price.

privatised in Brazil this year, announced an inflation-adjusted net loss for
last year of NCrz1.5bn, or about Dollars 5.3m at today's unofficial rates.
In 1989, the group registered an inflation-adjusted net profit of NCrz36bn.
Using another accounting method, the group claimed a net profit of
NCrz1.9bn, a result which led Usiminas to claim it was the only steel group
in Brazil last year to record a positive result.
The group blamed recession at home and an overvalued cruzeiro for the feeble
figures. Demand for steel dropped 30 per cent in Brazil last year, dipping
to its lowest level in 13 years. These factors, however, did not exact a
heavy toll on gross receipts, which rose in real terms from NCrz129bn in
1989 to NCrz139bn last year.
A bigger problem seemed to be mounting expenditures on debt service. In
1989, Usiminas earned large amounts of interest on its resources but in
1990, the situation had turned around, and led the group to declare a loss
on operations of NCrz2.1bn.
This loss was despite what the group referred to as a 'rigorous programme to
reduce costs'.

FT  23 APR 91 / Venezuela may sell 35% of airline overseas

VENEZUELA, in announcing the conditions under which it will privatise its
Viasa international airline, says foreign airlines will be able to buy
around 35 per cent of the airline's shares.
The government stipulates that although it plans to sell up to 60 per cent
of Viasa, it will keep at least 51 per cent in the Venezuelan hands. It also
says airline employees can own up to 20 per cent of Viasa under stock
purchase plans.
Viasa, which flies to Europe, the US, Latin America and the Caribbean, made
a loss last year. Profits in previous years were due mainly to government
export bonuses.
Viasa operates five DC-10 jets (four are owned by the airline, one is
leased) and three leased Airbus 300-B4s.
Officials say they plan to complete the privatisation of Viasa by July of
this year. Potential bidders must set up consortia that will be able to
operate the airline, the government said.
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) plans capital investments of Dollars 48bn for
domestic and international projects by 1996, including direct capital
outlays of Dollars 34bn by PDVSA itself.
In addition, Dollars 14bn is to be invested by overseas subsidiaries,
partners in existing joint ventures and private companies which are
developing new projects with PDVSA.
PDVSA is one of the world's largest petroleum companies and has oil refining
and distribution assets in the US, Germany, Sweden and Belgium. The Dollars
34bn in direct investments programmed by PDVSA represents an increase of 36
per cent - or Dollars 9bn - over the Dollars 25bn investment programme for
1991-96 announced at the end of last year.
In 1990, PDVSA's total turnover topped Dollars 23bn. The company has over
60bn barrels in proven reserves of crude oil, the largest in the western
hemisphere.

<TEXT>
VME Group, the construction equipment group owned jointly by Volvo of Sweden
and Clark Equipment of the US, plans to invest SKr135m (Dollars 21.8m) in
its articulated dumptruck business, including SKr80m for a new factory in
Sweden.
The investment is one of the very few so far this year in the construction
equipment industry, which has been hit by recession in the US and UK. In
February VME announced a 10 per cent rise in 1990 operating profits to
Dollars 79m, against the industry trend and helped by a strong performance
in continental Europe.
VME is the world's largest producer of articulated dumptrucks and will be
investing the money in its Swedish-based subsidiary VME Articulated Haulers.
Manufacturing will be moved to a new plant near the existing one at Braas,
Sweden. VME plans to modernise the dumptruck frames and bodies and
reorganise the workforce. Production at the new plant will begin in autumn,
1992.
VME also plans to concentrate production of rigid dumptrucks at its plant in
Guelph, Canada. Production at the group's rigid hauler operations in
Landskrona, Sweden, will cease at the end of 1992.

<TEXT>
CUMMINS Engine, one of the world's leading diesel engine makers, suffered a
first-quarter operating loss and warned of a further decline in the North
American heavy truck market.
Cummins' bottom line was bolstered by various accounting changes, which
resulted in net earnings of Dollars 17.2m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, compared
with Dollars 8.9m, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.
But sales slipped to Dollars 811.5m from Dollars 861.4m, and there was a
loss before the accounting changes of Dollars 34.3m. A new inventory
accounting method and an adjustment to the method of depreciating engine
production equipment produced a one-time gain of Dollars 26.5m.
The company expects to decide within the next month whether to cut its
dividend from the present annual rate of Dollars 2.20 a share.
This month Cummins said its second-quarter operating loss would be cut
substantially provided production volumes hold, but it warned yesterday that
a further drop in the truck market is expected over the next few months.
North American heavy-truck output has sunk by 45 per cent since the first
quarter of 1989 and by 14 per cent since last summer.
Cummins said the UK truck market and worldwide orders for off-highway
vehicles have also weakened 'significantly'.
The company has laid off another 170 workers at its US heavy-truck engine
plants this month, bringing the cuts to 3,800 people, or 14 per cent of the
worldwide workforce, in the past months.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: San Miguel debt plan overturned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN by San Miguel, the Philippine brewing conglomerate, to issue
convertible debt has been voted down by shareholders after the company's
former chairman had argued that the issue would prejudice his interests.
The vote at the San Miguel annual meeting on Friday represents another
winning round by former chairman, Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, in the fight to
reassume a substantial role in the management of San Miguel.
At stake, according to Mr Cojuangco's lawyer, was ultimate control of San
Miguel, the Philippines' biggest industrial company.
Under the management's debt plan, shares in San Miguel nominally owned by Mr
Cojuangco, but held in trust by the government, would not have qualified for
the convertible issue.
Mr Cojuangco's 18 per cent equity stake in San Miguel was taken into
guardianship by the Good Government Commission in 1986 because of
allegations that the shares were acquired illegally.
The shares remain in dispute and were thus unavailable for Friday's
shareholder vote. Since the plan involved the eventual issue of 7.5 per cent
of San Miguel's outstanding shares, it threatened to dilute seriously Mr
Cojuangco's potential shareholding.
Mr Andres Soriano, the chairman of San Miguel, said the company's management
believed the 3bn pesos (Dollars 110m) convertible debt issue was 'in the
best interests of the company', and that its rejection 'could hurt some of
our plans'.
The issue, together with 2bn pesos from internally generated sources, was
earmarked for an expansion and modernisation programme.
The Good Government Commission holds stakes in 300 Philippine companies
pending a determination of whether they represent unlawful proceeds.
Mr Estelito Mendoza, Mr Cojuangco's lawyer, said the decision was likely to
have a knock-on effect for another Cojuangco case pending before the Supreme
Court.
This relates to shares seized by the commission in the United Coconut
Planters Bank, which, if freed, would unlock the bank's indirectly-owned 30
per cent stake in San Miguel.
Along with the 18 per cent stake and residual proxies, this would give Mr
Cojuangco effective control of San Miguel together with eight of the 15
seats on its board of directors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KAO, the Japanese toiletries maker, last year suffered losses in its
overseas operations which virtually wiped out the increase in profits made
inside Japan.
The group yesterday posted a rise in consolidated pre-tax profits for the
year to March of just 0.4 per cent to Y38bn (Dollars 274m), compared with an
increase of 3.4 per cent to Y40.1bn at the parent company. The parent
company accounts for the bulk of Kao's operations within Japan. Six
subsidiaries, including the US business, made losses.
The parent company saw sales rise 4.5 per cent to Y570bn. Growth was held
back by intense competition in the market for household detergents, where
Kao's highly-successful Attack has spawned imitators. Also, Kao made little
new headway in hygiene products, including disposable nappies, where it
launched New Merries. On a consolidated basis, sales were up 6.7 per cent at
Y662bn.
For the current year, Kao forecasts parent company sales of Y585bn, an
increase of 2.6 per cent, and pre-tax profits of Y42bn, up 3.4 per cent. Kao
said it hoped for increases in sales and profits despite a slow-down in the
Japanese economy. It said that because the domestic market for household
products was mature it was pouring its energies into developing new markets.

ABITIBI-PRICE, one of Canada's three biggest integrated pulp and paper
groups, yesterday revealed that it had posted a small loss in the first
quarter.
It also warned it expected a difficult year because of poor markets,
especially in newsprint.
Sales in the period dipped 7.5 per cent to CDollars 726m (USDollars 625m)
and the first-quarter loss was CDollars 5.5m or 9 cents a share, against a
loss of CDollars 11.3m or 17 cents a year earlier, including a CDollars
13.7m special charge.
During the quarter, Abitibi, controlled by the Reichmann brothers of
Toronto, made two disposals for CDollars 53m.
More non-core assets will be sold to reduce debt.
Even the paper distribution and converting businesses, though profitable,
will be adversely affected by the recession throughout 1991.
In the first quarter Abitibi lost money on an operating basis in all its
activities, except distribution and converted products.
Newsprint production was 444,000 tonnes and groundwood papers were 105,000
tonnes, both around the same level as a year earlier.
Campeau Corp has sold a 10 year old office building in Montreal to
Confederation Life Insurance, raising the total generated by property sales
in eastern Canada to about CDollars 500m in the past year.

<TEXT>
NOVA, a large Canadian energy, pipeline and petrochemicals group, is
considering splitting its business into two separate companies, with
shareholders maintaining their proportionate interests.
Nova is the main natural gas pipeline operator in Alberta, a
provincially-regulated business and hiving off this activity would ease the
task of raising new capital.
The other entity would hold the oil and gas and petrochemical interests and
raise capital on its own.
Petrochemicals and plastics are subject to big price swings. At present the
gas transmission business accounts for more than half Nova's total business.
In 1988 Nova bought Polysar's petrochemical business for well over CDollars
2bn (USDollars 1.7bn) and last year sold the synthetic rubber division for
CDollars 1.35bn. Its 43 per cent interest in Husky Oil would be rolled into
the new energy and petrochemicals company.
RBC Dominion Securities and Morgan Stanley of New York are advising Nova on
the restructuring.

examined by Canada
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Canadian government's Bureau of Competition Policy has begun a formal
inquiry into the proposed acquisition of Square D of the US by France's
Groupe Schneider.
Both companies, which produce electrical equipment, have significant
competing businesses in Canada.
Under Canadian law, an inquiry begins only if there are reasonable grounds
to believe an acquisition could substantially prevent or lessen competition
in Canada.
Square D has been fighting off Schneider efforts to take it over since
February, when Schneider made an unsolicited offer of USDollars 78 per
share, or Dollars 1.9bn, for the company. Square D wants to remain
independent and is looking for third parties with which to make alliances.
Mr Jerre Stead, chairman of Square D, said Schneider's takeover effort
'raises substantial questions under the Canadian competition laws as well as
under the US anti-trust laws and competition laws of several European
countries'.
A US District Court is scheduled to consider Square D's allegations that the
Schneider acquisition would violate US anti-trust laws on May 13.
Square D is also urging the US Federal Reserve to review the Schneider
takeover bid on the grounds that it would violate US banking laws. American
bank holding companies are prohibited from owning more than 5 per cent of a
non-banking company.
At issue, according to Square D, is the control of Schneider by Paribas and
Societe Generale, the big French retail bank, which hold 9.7 per cent and 10
per cent, respectively, of the shares of SPEP, which in turn holds a
majority interest in Schneider.

first quarter

<TEXT>
UNUSUALLY high refining margins in Europe and the Pacific Rim helped boost
Mobil Corp's first-quarter earnings by 78 per cent.
North America's second biggest integrated oil company lifted net earnings to
Dollars 710m, or Dollars 1.73 a share, from Dollars 400m, or 94 cents a
share, a year earlier.
The 1990 figure included a Dollars 28m tax charge from a prior period. Sales
climbed by 10 per cent to Dollars 16.6bn.
The improved earnings were due largely to the strong performance of several
international businesses. Income from marketing and refining soared
four-fold to Dollars 442m, with non-US operations contributing Dollars 342m,
compared with Dollars 81m a year earlier.
Mobil ascribed the wide international refining margins to a shortage of
capacity. Earnings were especially strong in Singapore and in Australia,
where Mobil has acquired Exxon's refining and marketing operations.
Natural gas output outside the US rose to record levels, due partly to the
cold winter in Europe. On the other hand, North American exploration and
production earnings were hit by the unremitting fall in natural gas prices
caused by warm weather, weak demand and competition from alternative liquid
fuels.
Crude oil prices were about level with a year ago, but some Dollars 10 a
barrel below the fourth-quarter average.
Mr Allen Murray, the chairman, said that although refining margins have
recently narrowed from the peaks earlier this year, 'they should continue to
support good earnings, although below first-quarter levels'. He noted,
however, that earnings from petrochemicals have recently come under
pressure.

THE IMPACT of recession on advertising demand and the cost of covering the
Gulf war has cut into the profitability of Capital Cities/ABC, one of the
three biggest US television networks.
It yesterday unveiled a 38 per cent slump in first-quarter operating income
to Dollars 120.2m and warned of a possible further decline in second-quarter
earnings.
The company owns the ABC radio and television national networks, local
television and radio stations and weekly newspapers, including the Fairchild
fashion trade publications.
It said first-quarter net income plunged about 45 per cent to Dollars 58.6m
or Dollars 3.50 a share from Dollars 106.3m or Dollars 6.08 a year earlier
on revenues which were essentially unchanged at Dollars 1.26bn.
Operating income in the first three months of 1991 was Dollars 130.3m,
against Dollars 211.5m a year ago, while income before taxes dropped 44 per
cent to Dollars 103.4m from Dollars 186.2m.
Capital Cities/ABC's weak first-quarter performance comes on the heels of
poor results from CBS and General Electric's NBC broadcasting business,
which were also hurt by higher news costs and the very weak advertising
market.
Capital Cities/ABC said yesterday there had been a return to more normal
business patterns since the end of the Gulf war.
However, the company said levels of advertising demand might not be
sufficient to prevent earnings from declining in the second quarter of this
year.
Capital Cities/ABC said the operating profits from its television network in
the first quarter of 1991 represented a significant decline from the
previous year's results.
In the three months ended March 31, revenues from the company's broadcasting
operating advanced to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 992.5m, thanks to gains from
the telecast of the Super Bowl and two National Football League (NFL) Wild
Card playoff games.
Capital Cities/ABC's publishing operations brought in revenues of Dollars
250.6m in the latest quarter, down about 7 per cent from the previous year.
Operating income from publishing dropped 24 per cent to Dollars 18.4m from
Dollars 24.3m, with declines in all operating groups.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISTITUTO Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the big Turin-based bank, is
negotiating to buy Banco Catala de Credit, a
medium-sized Spanish bank owned by Banco Banesto.
The purchase would substantially boost San Paolo's expansion plans in Spain,
where it bought a 35 per cent stake in Banca Matutes, a small 32-branch
private bank, last year.
Banco Catala de Credit has 105 branches, 26 of which are around its
Barcelona base, and the remainder in Catalonia. It had net profits of
L12.3bn (Dollars 9.59m) last year. Banca Matutes is concentrated on the
Balearic Islands. San Paolo itself last year opened a Madrid branch.
San Paolo could not comment on the likely price for the acquisition, but
confirmed talks were under way on a letter of intent.
Separately, the company denied recent Italian press reports that San Paolo
had substantially raised its stake in Hambros, the UK merchant bank,
following the sale by Baltica, the Danish insurance group, of a 14 per cent
stake.
San Paolo's holding has recently risen to about 14.9 per cent from 14.3 per
cent, but this was due to the exercise of convertible bond holdings.
Sasib, the quoted food, packaging and industrial group controlled by Mr
Carlo De Benedetti's CIR holding company, raised net profits by 16.6 per
cent to L70.2bn from L60.2bn last year.
Total sales jumped by 22 per cent to L619.7bn, with foreign turnover,
boosted by acquisitions, surging by 50 per cent to L439.2bn. The company is
paying a dividend of L230 for ordinary shares and L250 for its savings
shares respectively.

<TEXT>
BANCO SANTANDER, the Spanish commercial bank which owns 10 per cent of Royal
Bank of Scotland and which recently bought 13.3 per cent of First Fidelity
Bank in the US, said yesterday its first-quarter net consolidated profits
increased 21 per cent to Pta20bn (Dollars 187m).
Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), one of Santander's main Spanish rivals,
reported a 17.15 per cent drop in net first-quarter profits for its
financial group (which excludes its industrial corporation) to Pta12.99bn,
largely because of a sharp fall in extraordinary profits.
Santander, which recently sold control of Electra de Viesgo, a northern
electricity utility, for Pta40.5bn, giving it a net profit on the deal of
Pta14.8bn, said its cash flow in the first three months of 1991 had
increased 65.46 per cent to Pta54.4bn, almost half of which had been made
over to provisions and reserves.
Santander said shareholders would receive its second 1990 dividend payment -
Pta100 - on April 30, making the total payout for the year 16.22 per cent
higher than in 1989.
Banesto's lower results were due to sharply reduced extraordinary income
which usually involves disposal of assets. Banesto's financial group made
Pta2.9bn from such sales in the first three-quarters of this year against
Pta8bn last year.
Gross operating profits for the financial group rose, in contrast, by 12.5
per cent to Pta19.3bn due to a 9.8 per cent rise in the financial margin to
Pta42.9bn and to strongly increased income from commissions which were up by
51 per cent to Pta11.6bn. Operating costs were up by 19.5 per cent to
Pta35.3bn.
Total consolidated assets of the financial group, which exclude those of
Banesto's industrial conglomerate, increased by 26.4 per cent to Pta5,399bn
in the first quarter.
A notable feature of this figure was a 29.7 per cent rise in loans to
Pta2,606bn. In the first three months of 1990, loans to the private sector
were limited to a 10 per cent increase under the government's credit
restriction policy.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Spain's largest bank, said yesterday it had bought a
further 6 per cent of the large Catalan water utility, Aguas de Barcelona,
to take its stake in the group to 14.5 per cent.
The bank bought the extra stake from the Catalan gas utility, Catalana de
Gas. Its efforts to form a giant Catalan energy and resources group were
frustrated last year when Repsol, the state-owned oil conglomerate, and La
Caixa, the Barcelona savings bank, combined to take control of Catalana de
Gas and merge it into Repsol's growing gas interests.
The government, however, has been keen to prevent Aguas de Barcelona falling
into French hands and will have actively supported BBV increasing its stake.

DAIMLER-BENZ, the diversified German motor group, said its pre-tax profits

movements.
Because of a lower tax payment, however, net profits were 6 per cent higher

It actually announced a net profit of DM6.8bn for 1989, but DM5.1bn of this

for last year. Turnover rose by 5 per cent to DM85.5bn.
It said it would maintain its dividend at DM12 a share. Mr Edzard Reuter,

which especially affects Mercedes-Benz car sales in the US - and worsening
economic conditions would hold back profits.
Last week, AEG, its electrical and electronics subsidiary, announced a
DM205m loss for 1990; Daimler said a further loss was expected this year as
a result of restructuring measures.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Nixdorf holds back Siemens
result

<TEXT>
SIEMENS made a first-half loss of DM380m (Dollars 227m) on its computer
activities in the first half of the financial year to September 30, 1991, as
it began to integrate the business of Nixdorf, the company which it rescued
last year.
The continuation of Nixdorf's losses added to the burdens on the German
electrical and electronics group at a time when worldwide economic
conditions have deteriorated.
Its total first-half net profits rose by 6 per cent to DM793m. Siemens did
not spell out the extent to which the Nixdorf loss held back its full
result; analysts, who pointed out that German companies have considerable
accounting leeway in arranging how they report their results, have already
forecast lower group earnings per share this year.
The group said the loss made by Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme, created
by the merger of its computer interests with Nixdorf, partly reflected a
backlog of DM500m in unbilled sales. This was caused by the time taken to
integrate the two companies.
New computer orders in the first half totalled DM5.7bn, a fall of 5 per
cent, with invoiced sales 17 per cent lower at DM5.1bn; allowing for the
backlog, however, sales were less than 10 per cent lower.
Siemens said the integration of Nixdorf was going well, but was not
completed.
Strong gains in orders and sales were recorded in the second quarter.
Siemens Nixdorf said recently it might not show a profit for the whole of
1990-91. Nixdorf made a DM800m loss in the last nine months before its full
absorption by Siemens in last October; DM300m of this was to meet
restructuring costs and valuation changes.
The group has already warned that growth in total profits would be difficult
this year.
In the last financial year, net income rose by 6 per cent to DM1.7bn and
Siemens raised its dividend.
Outlining overall group progress in the first half, Siemens said it booked a
15 per cent rise in new orders to DM41.4bn, though half the improvement
stemmed from the first-time inclusion of new businesses.
Domestic orders showed a 30 per cent advance, with business in east Germany,
much of it linked to vital infrastructure improvements, totalling DM1.4bn.
The group said foreign business stagnated. The 6 per cent rise in foreign
orders to DM23bn was mainly due to the inclusion of the merged Siemens
Nixdorf operation and the activities acquired from Plessey of the UK.
Turnover during the period totalled DM33.1bn, a rise of 9 per cent; of this,
7 percentage points were due to the enlargement of the group.

SHIZUSHIN Lease, a Japanese financial company with debts of Y255.5bn
(Dollars 186m), filed for court protection from its creditors yesterday in a
further sign of the pressures imposed by high interest rates and weak
property markets.
Shizushin, a medium-sized leasing company, will go bankrupt if its creditors
fail to agree on a reorganisation plan.
If it goes under, it will be the fourth-largest corporate failure in Japan
and the second-biggest this year after Nanatomi, a property developer, which
went bankrupt owing Y300bn.
Shizushin would be the first financial company to fail during the squeeze on
credit in Japan. It was founded in 1982 and began by financing the lease of
office equipment. It subsequently expanded into property lending.
Its borrowers include a company run by Mr Suemitsu Ito, a property developer
connected with Itoman, the trading company which got into financial
difficulties through investment in land. Mr Ito worked for Itoman for eight
months until he resigned late last year. During that time, he was
responsible for expanding its property investments.
Shizushin, based in Shizuoka, a town west of Tokyo, was established with the
help of the Shizuoka Shinkin Bank, a local institution.
Shizuoka Shinkin has a 4.7 per cent stake in Shizushin, but it is not
thought to be threatened by the leasing company's difficulties.

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S Vard shipping group said yesterday that in the first quarter of
this year it had plunged into a pre-tax deficit of NKr37.3m (Dollars 5.53m),
compared with profits of NKr104.4m in the same period of 1990.
Vard said that the poor result was due mainly to a large number of
cancellations by customers for Kloster Cruise, the group's cruise unit,
during the Gulf war.
Kloster Cruise reversed its 1990 first-quarter NKr67.5m profit into a
NKr25.9m loss for the first quarter of this year. The figure includes a
currency exchange gain of NKr84.1m.
The group warned that Kloster Cruise's bookings in the second quarter will
also be affected by a general decline in the cruise market but suggested
that results would improve.
Vard said that the capacity in Royal Viking Line, another cruise operation,
is to be reduced by 70 per cent in 1992.

stake
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAS CORPORATE raider Mr T. Boone Pickens is considering selling his 26.4
per cent stake in Koito Manufacturing, the Japanese motor parts manufacturer
which has repeatedly spurned his advances.
A spokesman for Mr Pickens yesterday told the Associated Press news agency
that the disposal of the Koito shares, currently worth about Dollars 850m,
is among several options being considered by the Dallas-based financier.
'We're not in any rush, but it's one of the things we're looking at,' the
spokesman said.
However, he denied Japanese reports that Mr Pickens has already sold his
shares back to Mr Kitaro Watanabe, the Japanese speculator who secretly
financed the purchases with a loan secured by the shares.
A Koito spokesman said in New York yesterday that the Japanese company had
no 'direct information' on the reports of Mr Pickens' retreat, but that 'we
would certainly not be surprised by such a turn of events'.
Mr Pickens has had several well-publicised run-ins with Koito, which has
refused to give him any representation on its board and has consistently
accused him of being a front for Mr Watanabe's efforts at short-term
speculation.
The market price of Koito shares has halved since Mr Pickens made his
initial investment two years ago through his privately-held holding company
Boone Co.
Besides Koito's unremitting hostility, Mr Pickens' willingness to put his
shares up for sale may be influenced by the financial difficulties of Mesa
Limited Partnership, the large US natural gas producer of which Mr Pickens
is the general partner and in which he has a 4.5 per cent stake.
One New York analyst also suggested yesterday that Mr Pickens may see his
continued involvement with Koito as a hurdle to his apparent ambitions to
run for election as governor of Texas.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: How Group declines 19% and warns of bigger
fall this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW GROUP, the Midlands-based building services contractor, warned that
profits were likely to be much lower this year as the trading environment
remained difficult.
Mr Peter How, chairman, said: 'In a recession the bigger companies and the
smaller companies come out better and it's the people in the middle who get
squeezed. But we're not ultra dispirited.'
The group made its forecast as it reported a 19 per cent decline, from
Pounds 5.18m to Pounds 4.21m, in pre-tax profits for 1990.
However, the 1989 figure included Pounds 1.15m from investment disposals.
A fall in margins had put pressure on profitability, Mr How said. Margins
were down about 1 per cent on order book values.
Turnover rose 6 per cent to Pounds 236.58m (Pounds 222.83m) while orders
overall had fallen about 15 per cent.
The group was particularly hurt by a 20 per cent fall in the engineering
division's order books since that accounted for a large proportion of its
businesses. Costs associated with delayed orders were a main factor, Mr How
said.
On the other hand, the distribution division, which supplies refrigeration
and air conditioning machinery, saw its order book climb, helped by the fact
that its business was outside the construction industry.
Steps had been taken to try to maintain profit margins, tighten credit
controls and cut costs through staff reductions.
Recent bids were on very slim profit margins so that the group has had to be
extremely selective in what it tendered for, Mr How said. It still had a net
cash position.
Earnings per share were 5.94p (8.32p) and an unchanged final dividend of
2.25p is recommended, holding the total at 3.6p.
In order to bring more accountability to the organisation, the
decision-making and managerial functions have been split.
A main board will be responsible for planning and monitoring performance,
and a group executive board will be responsible for implementing policies
and overseeing the management of divisions.
Mr David Summerfield has taken over as chief executive from Mr Arthur
Hogarth, who is retiring as managing director.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ramco rises to Pounds 1.1m and seals Soviet
joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAMCO OIL Services, which provides tubes to the North Sea oil industry,
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m for 1990, compared with Pounds
942,000 previously.
The heavy burden of maintenance currently underway in the North Sea, which
requires the shutdown of installations, kept turnover static at Pounds
4.78m, but Ramco is paying an annual dividend of 2p - its first for five
years. Earnings rose 0.1p to 3.96p.
Mr Stephen Remp, chairman, said he was looking for a boost to turnover next
year when extensive North Sea maintenance work would be complete.
At the beginning of this year, Ramco set up a joint-venture operation to
import oil pumps from the Soviet Union in a bid to capture 10 per cent of
the Dollars 500m (Pounds 292m) western market for electric submersible
pumps.
Alnas, the Soviet company which makes the pumps, has taken a 50 per cent
stake in the Aberdeen-based venture to market the pumps in the west and two
Soviet directors sit on its board.
The first shipment of pumps is due to arrive in June.
In an effort to break into the market, Mr Remp said the company would try to
get round any reluctance it encounters among western firms by offering
generous guarantees to replace any pump which fails in its first year of
operation.
Alnas started making the electric pumps 12 years ago in a bid to reduce the
dependence of the Soviet oil industry on imported equipment. Its
manufacturing facilities were set up using western technology to make a
Soviet-designed pump.
Mr Remp said the high quality of the pumps meant that they could last up to
800 days while western pumps will last 200-600 days. Nevertheless, he said
he thought the venture would have to offer some price advantages to make
them attractive to western buyers.
Flexible arrangements would also be offered on hire or hire-purchase and
giving companies the chance to have the pumps on a trial basis. Alnas is
carrying the cost of holding stock by supplying pumps and taking the payment
when they are sold.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Polymark prospects justify 1p dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYMARK International, the industrial laundry equipment and technographics
group, is returning to the dividend list after an absence of 10 years as
'medium-term prospects are sufficiently encouraging'.
Fully diluted earnings per share benefited from a low tax charge and moved
ahead to 5.07p in 1990, against 4.49p. The proposed dividend is 1p.
Pre-tax profit, however, fell from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 1.51m in the year.
That reflected a substantial reduction in operating income from discontinued
activities of Pounds 421,000 (Pounds 2.51m), which was offset somewhat by an
improvement in continuing operations from Pounds 237,000 to Pounds 594,000
and interest credit of Pounds 442,000 (charge of Pounds 785,000).
Mr Len Weaver, chairman, said the laundry division held its profit at Pounds
352,000 after reorganisation costs of Pounds 42,000. In technographics, a
programme to improve productivity and enhance margins led to a turnround
from a loss of Pounds 114,000 to a profit of Pounds 242,000.
He said much was done to create a more stable and profitable basis for the
continuing operations.
Below the line there was an extraordinary profit of Pounds 2.92m, being the
final dividend from Polymark France and surplus on the sale of the French
division.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: New EFM trust comes to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market's current enthusiasm for split capital investment trusts
continues with the Pounds 15m flotation of EFM Income Trust.
There are two classes of shares in the trust, managed by Edinburgh Fund
Managers. Zero dividend preference shares, with a par value of 25p, are
being issued at 35p each. The trust will repay zero holders at 95p per share
in the year 2000, a compound growth rate of 11.75 per cent.
Although repayment at that level is not guaranteed, the trust will be able
to do so, provided net asset value does not fall between now and 2000.
The ordinary shares, issued at 65p apiece, will be entitled to all the
income. EFM expects the yield on the shares to be above that on the FT-A
All-Share Index. Net assets of the trust will need to grow at 6 per cent per
annum compound for the shares to be repaid at the issue price in 2000.
The trust will invest in the UK, with about 80 per cent in equities and the
rest in convertibles, bonds and cash.
Allied Provincial Securities is underwriting and sponsoring the issue, which
consists of a placing of 15m of each class of share. Dealings are expected
to start on April 29.

BURNFIELD, a manufacturer of electric surface heating systems, returned
profits of Pounds 1.41m pre-tax and exceptional items for the 11 months to
end-December.
For the previous 12 months the group, which has been restructured and now
operates under a new management team, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.06m.
Turnover for the period under review totalled Pounds 15.31m (Pounds 17.03m).
Exceptional items accounted for Pounds 701,000 (nil) and tax for Pounds
542,000 (Pounds 868,000). Extraordinary provisions of Pounds 3.06m reflected
reorganisation costs and a deferred tax write-off.
Excluding exceptional items, earnings per share emerged at 7.5p (10.8p)
basic or at 7p (9.5p) fully diluted.
An unchanged final dividend of 3.85p makes a same-again 5.5p total.

IN ITS first set of results to be reported in sterling, Kingston Oil &amp; Gas,
the production and development group, made Pounds 608,624 in 1990, compared
with Pounds 720,673 in the 18 months to December 31 1989.
Kingston's directors maintained that the conversion from dollars to pounds
was adversely affected by exchange rate movements over the period.
Turnover rose to Pounds 3.43m (Pounds 2.84m for 18 months), but operating
profits were down at Pounds 583,702 (Pounds 699,286). Earnings worked
through at 4.86p per share, against 7.07p, and the final dividend is a
proposed 1p, to make 1.56p for the year. The total pay-out in the 18-month
period was 1.66p.
Last August Kingston bought Orcol Fuels, a waste oil reclamation business,
for Pounds 4.5m, providing the company with its first UK earnings base.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: BP nightmare haunts sale of stake in BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MINISTERS finalise their proposals for the sale of part of the
government's 48.6 per cent stake in British Telecom, the 1987 flotation of
British Petroleum is weighing heavily on their minds.
BP was the last major secondary sale, valued at Pounds 7.5bn, including a
Pounds 1.5bn rights issue, and proved something of a nightmare. Although
considered a one-off because of the collapse in the stock market government
officials believe there is much to be learnt from the issue.
The shares were originally offered at a 20p discount to the 350p market
price. But when the world's markets crashed in late October potential
investors were looking at a 70p loss.
No-one is expecting a collapse in the market this year; however, even the
smallest of movements between pricing the BT sale and trading in the new
shares could have a significant effect on the issue.
A fall in the market wipes out potential investors' discounts while a rise
leaves the Treasury open to Labour accusations of a giveaway.
Government advisers believe the key lesson from the BP sale is that the time
between pricing and trading was too long.
Government sales normally take three weeks, a week to print and send the
prospectus after pricing is announced, a week for investors to receive and
fill in the form and a final seven days for allocation and processing.
If the prospectus could be sent out without the price officials believe they
could shave off seven days. This was suggested in the sale of the regional
electricity companies but rejected on the grounds that two weeks can create
as much nervousness as three.
For the BT sale to be made BP-proof and immune from market movements the gap
between the pricing and trading needs to cut to less than two weeks.
Shareholders need a guarantee that their discounts will not be wiped out by
movements in the market.
If this can be achieved Government advisers believe they may be able to do
without sub-underwriters. (Primary underwriters were dispensed with in the
last privatisation).
There are two other main lessons to be learnt from the BP sale.
The first is that ringfencing allocations to different markets is
counter-productive. In 1987 BP wanted more shares to be sold abroad.
Government officials now believe it was a mistake not to do so since it
would have generated greater competition between the institutions.
The Treasury is expected to introduce more flexibility into the BT sale,
allowing more than half of the shares to be sold in foreign markets,
creating fierce competition between institutions, thereby maximising the
price.
The second lesson is that while advertising can work wonders in druming up
interest in a issue - more than 6m people registered for the BP shares - it
does not mean that those registered will buy shares. A little more than
200,000 of the 6m parted with their money.
As a result much of the funds earmarked for advertising may end up paying
banks and building societies bigger commissions to trade BT shares, making
it easier for the small investors to take part in the sale.

CRONITE GROUP, the Birmingham-based industrial holding company, said

where irregularities, including misappropriation, had been discovered.
The shares, suspended at 12p on April 5, rose to 23p when were restored to
listing after the announcement.
The bigger of the two subsidiaries is Cronite Alloys, which recycles
stainless steel. The other is Abtex, which manufactures hand portable fire
extinguishers.
The company said it also intended to close or dispose of two other
businesses, Hy-Tech, a machining company, and North American Cronite, a
sales organisation.
Accounts for the five months to end-February, also published yesterday,
showed total losses for the four companies, including closure costs, of
Pounds 3.05m. At the pre-tax line, the company incurred a Pounds 2.18m loss.
That compared with a Pounds 1.22m profit for the year to end-September.
Cronite said it had discovered that Alloys had suffered a shortfall in
expected income amounting to about Pounds 400,000 while management accounts
had overstated the value of certain stock by Pounds 500,000. At Abtex,
continuing trading difficulties had been exacerbated by misappropriation of
stock.
Concluding that continuation of losses at these two subsidiaries would have
an unsustainable effect on cash requirements, Cronite had requested
Barclays, its bank, to appoint receivers.
Mr James Lindsay-German, chief executive, said he could not comment on
whether the irregularities would give rise to any legal action. The decision
follows investigations by Arthur Anderson, the accountants.
Cronite said Barclays had confirmed the availability of facilities for the
remainder of the year, subject to an Pounds 8.2m maximum, and with this
arranged it hoped it would be able to develop its profitable businesses.
But there will be no interim dividend owing to a shortfall in distributable
reserves.
At the trading level, five-monthly losses at discontinued businesses were
Pounds 1.87m (against Pounds 70,000 for the 12 month period) while profits
at the rest of the group were Pounds 262,000 (Pounds 2.4m). Net assets per
share were 31.1p (48.2p).
The deterioration follows a sharp fall in profitability during the previous
year when pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m were about half their 1989 level.

<TEXT>
THE OFFER for sale of Greencore, the formerly state-owned Irish Sugar group
which is being floated in London and Dublin, has been about 2.8 times
subscribed.
Yesterday the company said applications had been received for 111.8m shares,
against the 39.46m available. The offer price was IPounds 2.30.
Stripping out shares for which firm undertakings had been received and which
have been fully allotted, and those laid aside for employees and beet
growers, 15.52m shares were available generally. These attracted 87.86m
applications and they are being scaled down as follows:
Applications for 100 to 299 shares will result in the allocation of 100
shares; for 300-599, 200; for 600-999, 300; for 1,000 to 2,499, 400; for
2,500 to 4,999, 700; for 5,000 to 9,999, 1,250; for 10,000 to 15,999, 2,000.
Applications above 16,000 shares will receive one seventh of the amount
requested.
The sale, which marks the first big privatisation of an Irish state concern,
is of 55 per cent of the shares. Dealings are expected to commence on
Friday.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins declines to Pounds 20.36m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in the UK housebuilding industry has caused pre-tax profits to
fall for the second year in succession at Travis Perkins, the builders'
merchant and timber group.
Last year profits fell by almost 38 per cent, from Pounds 32.8m to Pounds
20.36m. In the previous 12 months pre-tax profits fell by 16 per cent.
Mr Tony Travis, chairman said: 'The current year will be another difficult
one for the construction industry. The first three months of this year,
particularly January and February, were very poor. First-half profits,
therefore, will be down sharply on those achieved in the corresponding
period last year.
'The downturn is such that it will be very difficult to catch it up during
the rest of the year - even allowing for a recovery in the second half of
the year.'
Pre-tax profits last year were reduced by about Pounds 4m charged against
bad debts: 'Bad debts, as a proportion of sales, were about three times
higher than we would expect in a normal market,' said Mr Travis.
Redundancy costs reduced profits by a further Pounds 1.5m. There was an
exceptional charge of a similar amount to cover the final costs of
integrating the Travis Arnold and Sandall Perkins businesses, merged in
1988.
There was a net reduction of about 400 staff last year, achieved through a
combination of natural wastage and redundancy. The group, on the other hand,
raised about Pounds 3m from property sales.
Turnover fell by 3.6 per cent from Pounds 360.9m to Pounds 347.7m. Volume
sales were down by about a tenth. Profits in the second six months fell by
more than half to Pounds 6.9m. This compares with a 21 per cent fall to
Pounds 13.5m in the first half.
'The last quarter of 1990 was particularly gruelling, with bad debts and
redundancy costs adding to overheads as building activity continued to
decline,' said Mr Travis.
The group declared a final dividend of 5.5p making a total payment of 8p,
the same as in 1989. Dividends were 1.7 times covered by earnings per share
of 13.8p (22p).
COMMENT
About three quarters of Travis Perkins' sales go to the housing market for
repair, maintenance and improvement, as well as new house building. It is
therefore an ideal recovery stock as mortgage interest rates come down and
confidence in the housing sector starts to pick up. The company has no debt
and is well managed - gross margins actually improved slightly last year in
one of the most difficult periods for construction sales. The problem is in
gauging the timing and likely extent of the recovery. Housebuilders have
reported a rise in sales since interest rates began to fall in February.
Much of this, however, will be stock and it will take time for a recovery to
work through to building material sales. The company is right to be
cautious. Profits this year could slip further to about Pounds 18m. This
would put the group on a prospective p/e of 19 which looks expensive. Hold
for the long term and buy on weakness.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Mrs Fields warns of loss as Gulf war hits
sales
</HEADLINE>

   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Mrs Fields cookie company yesterday slumped 4 1/2 p to 11p after
warnings that it had fallen back into the red in the last financial year.
In a brief statement, the USM-quoted company said its preliminary results
for the year to the end of December 1990 would be published late next month
and the company would show a net loss.
It is expected to blame television coverage of the Gulf war for keeping
people at home and depressing sales of cookies on the high street.
The company had previously been scheduled to announce its results today, and
the announcement dashed hopes that it would build on its modest return to
profit in 1989.
Last September, Mrs Fields reported lower net losses of Dollars 2.63m
(Dollars 3.53m) for the first half, fuelling hopes that the full-year result
could reach about Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.75m) against 1989's Dollars 1.53m.
After it floated on the USM in 1986, Mrs Fields acquired a notoriety for
disappointing shareholders, most notably in 1988 when it clocked up a net
loss of Dollars 18.9m.
Founders Mrs Debbi Fields and her husband stepped back from day-to-day
management last year.

<TEXT>
Arncliffe Holdings, the Leeds-based housebuilder, has requested a temporary
suspension of its shares, pending the conclusion of negotiations on a
capital injection and a strengthening of the board, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
'We have been in negotiations for some time and they are now at an advanced
stage,' directors said. Once the negotiations are completed, the group plans
to announce both results for the year to October 31 and details of the
proposed capital investment in the group. The shares were suspended at 83p.
In the half-year to April 30, Arncliffe suffered an 83 per cent plunge in
profits to Pounds 148,000 (Pounds 868,000). Profits were hurt by a sharply
higher interest charge of Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 593,000). The group said at
the time that it was working to reduce borrowings as quickly as possible.
Turnover dropped 18 per cent to Pounds 7.52m (Pounds 9.18m) and the interim
dividend was passed (2.25p). Earnings per share were 1.94p (11.28p).

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Institutions attempt to install new
management at Budgens - Board considering a number of options for future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of institutional shareholders is attempting to remove Mr John
Fletcher as chairman of Budgens and install a new management team at the
troubled grocery chain.
IEP Securities, Electra Investment Trust, and Gartmore Investment Trust,
which together hold 27 per cent of the shares, have put a proposal to the
board 'concerning the future direction of the company'.
This is understood to involve the appointment of three new directors
including Mr John von Spreckelsen, and two associates, Mr Christian Williams
and Mr Graham Rigby.
Mr von Spreckelsen is credited with having rejuvenated KAFU-Wasmund
Handelsgesellschaft, a supermarket chain which is based in Bremen, Germany.
The group's proposal is said to be 'under active consideration' by the
Budgens' board although the company stated that it was also reviewing a
number of other options for developing the business.
In recent years, Budgens has recorded poor results having suffered from high
borrowings and the disruption caused by setting up a new distribution
centre. Yesterday one analyst described the performance of the company as
'utterly disastrous'.
Earlier this year, the company announced a severe drop in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 4.71m to Pounds 505,000 and analysts suggested it might
only make Pounds 1.5m in the full year.
Budgens, formerly known as Barker &amp; Dobson, runs a chain of 95 neighbourhood
grocery stores. It has faced stiff competition from Marks and Spencer and is
seen as being under further threat as J Sainsbury and Tesco again express
interest in developing their high street outlets.
Mr Fletcher, who became chairman and chief executive of Budgens in 1985,
failed to consummate a planned merger with Wm Low, the Scottish-based
supermarket chain, in 1989.
This followed a highly ambitious but ultimately abortive attempt to buy Dee
Corporation for Pounds 2bn.
Budgens has recently strengthened its board through the appointment of Mr
Derek Pretty as finance director in December 1989 and Mr Keith Clarke as
managing director in April 1990.
Budgens' shares, which have fallen sharply during the past two years, closed
2p higher yesterday at 47p.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Boddington makes strong attack on Devenish
board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODDINGTON yesterday launched a blistering attack on Devenish, the West
Country brewer, accusing it of wasting millions of pounds of shareholders'
money.
In a document sent out to Devenish shareholders, containing details of its
Pounds 127.7m hostile takeover bid, Boddington, the pubs, hotels and
health-care group, accuses the Devenish board of wasting more than Pounds
80m on advertising new brands marketed under the Newquay Steam label.
Boddington says the investment by Devenish 'was ill-conceived from the
outset' and alleges that its failure has had an adverse effect on the
company's profitability.
It accuses Devenish of U-turns in its strategy in first buying wholesalers
only to sell them later, and queries the value attributed in the company's
accounts to the brewery.
For good measure, it says plans by Devenish to expand the number of its pubs
'has failed to materialise'.
Mr Hubert Reid, managing director of Boddington, said:
'Devenish's decision to invest in brewing and brands was a grave mistake.
'It was also badly executed. Its board is guilty of poor judgement and then
poorly carrying out those decisions.'
A spokesman for Devenish denied the charges and said there was nothing
substantially new in the document which still failed to address the fact
that Boddington's hostile bid 'substantially undervalues' the company.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Empire 'oui' to 125p cash bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPIRE STORES Group, the mail order retailer, has recommended its
shareholders to accept the 125p per share cash offer from Redoute Catalogue,
part of La Redoute, the French catalogue retail group.
Mr Martin Mays-Smith, chairman of Empire, recommended the offer although the
board believed it did 'not fully reflect the value of Empire'.
Empire claims a 7 per cent share of the UK mail order market. Its shares
were unchanged yesterday at 127p.
The recommendation was not supported by Gecos, the Italian retail group
which holds 24.2 per cent of Empire, has been a shareholder since 1984 and
has two representatives on the board. It is taking independent advice and
will clarify it's position by May 1.
It could remain a minority holder even if Redoute's offer succeeds, and if
sufficient other holders did not accept, the listing might be kept.
Redoute said last night it was pleased with the recommendation, but
concerned about a 'very gloomy trading statement' made by Empire as part of
its recommendation, and the lack of a profit forecast for the financial year
ending this weekend.
The first closing date for Redoute's offer is tomorrow but Redoute has
already promised to extend this to May 8.
Redoute said from the start that its offer, launched in mid-March, would not
be increased. This followed its purchase of a 12 per cent stake in Empire
from Great Universal Stores, the retail, property and finance company, and a
promise to GUS that the subsequent offer would be final.
Redoute already held almost 26 per cent of Empire when it bought the GUS
stake, giving it 37.9 per cent.
Mr Mays-Smith said Empire was recommending the offer, which values the group
at Pounds 49m, because trading had worsened since the group announced an
interim loss of Pounds 951,000 in January.
Sales had 'held up less well than we had expected' he said, and 'sales in
recent weeks have been particularly disappointing'. The group had also
suffered a rise in bad debts.
He said 'as a result the group's results in the current year will fall short
of those for which we had hoped at the time of my interim statement'.
Another reason for the recommendation was that the UK mail order industry
was being shaken up following the sale of Grattan to Otto Versand, the
German retailer, and the possible sale by Littlewoods of its mail order
side. This was likely to make the market more competitive. Also the
performance of Empire's shares, if it remained independent, was likely to be
affected by Redoute's holding.
The recommendation to shareholders also said they should accept 'unless a
higher offer is announced'. However, analysts said the chances of a rival
bid were slim given Redoute's stake. If a rival bidder had been interested
it would probably have shown its hand by now. Mr Mays-Smith said the group
was not in discussions with any other bidder.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Boot bucks sector trend with 19% rise to
Pounds 6.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXABLE PROFITS of Henry Boot &amp; Sons, the Sheffield-based construction and
property group, rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 6.36m in 1990 to provide a
rare profits advance in what was a very difficult year for most construction
groups.
Turnover declined to Pounds 131.03m (Pounds 136.13m), but earnings rose 15
per cent to 76.1p (66.1p) per share. The company proposed a final dividend
of 18p to make a total of 25p. This compares with 21p in 1989.
Mr Jamie Boot, managing director, said the group had a much lower exposure
to residential and commercial property markets than many construction
companies which have suffered as a result of falling demand in these
markets. Boot has no borrowings.
At the end of 1989 Boot had cash of about Pounds 9m. This position is
thought to have remained largely unchanged at the end of last year.
The company, of which the Boot family owns just over 50 per cent, said the
construction market had of late become more difficult. It warned that it was
unlikely 'that the past level of growth in earnings will be maintained in
the foreseeable future'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTERNATIONAL investor group has reduced its bid for Consoltex, the
Montreal-based fabric maker, from CDollars 38 to CDollars 33 per share and
Coats Viyella, which has owned 81 per cent of the Canadian company for the
past decade, has said this was fair value and it would accept.
In February, Consoltex reported 1990 profits of CDollars 9m (Pounds 4.54m),
or CDollars 3.14 per share, on sales of CDollars 169m, up slightly from
1989. At that time the investor group was willing to pay CDollars 38 per
share. Coats stood to collect to well over CDollars 110m.
However, in the first quarter of this year, Consoltex incurred losses of
CDollars 596,000, or 20 cents per share (profits of CDollars 2.7m, or 95
cents per share). Sales dipped 25 per cent to CDollars 34m. Federal and
Quebec sales taxes were applied to apparel for the first time on January 1,
causing a deep decline in clothing sales and thus fabric sales.
Consoltex expects some improvement in the rest of the year as interest rates
come down and the economy picks up steam.
The old offer was withdrawn and 'a revised investor group' made the new
offer, subject to 90 per cent acceptance, said Coats and Consoltex. Details
will be mailed early in May.
Consoltex would not reveal the principals behind the investor group.

FT  23 APR 91 / Guinness Mahon losses soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS MAHON, the merchant banking group which is 65 per cent owned by the
Bank of Yokohama, warned yesterday that it would report a heavy loss in its
interim results because of mounting bad debts.
The company is making a Pounds 30m provision for loan losses, and will
report an after-tax loss of Pounds 35m for the six months ending March 31.
An interim dividend is unlikely to be declared.
The group will seek to raise Pounds 50m through a rights issue. This will
have the full support of the Bank of Yokohama. The Pounds 50m will more than
double the Pounds 45m level to which Guinness Mahon's capital has been
reduced by the losses.
Mr Geoffrey Bell, chairman of Guinness Mahon, said yesterday that the losses
had been incurred mainly because of the bank's policy of lending to the
property and small company sectors, both of which had been badly hit by the
recession. The bank had also lent Pounds 5m to Polly Peck, which collapsed
last year.
The provisions were decided on after a team from Bank of Yokohama came to
the UK to examine the Guinness Mahon loan book, Mr Bell said. It was decided
to deal conservatively with all possible losses to avoid having to make
further provisions later on.
No management changes are planned, but Mr Bell said that the Bank of
Yokohama would be placing more people in London to keep a closer watch on
operations. The Japanese have three representatives on Guinness Mahon's
12-person board.
The news triggered a sharp fall in Guinness Mahon's share price. The stock
closed at 42p, down 8p on the day. This compares with the 146p per share
paid by Bank of Yokohama. The Japanese group bought its stake for Pounds 95m
in 1989 in the first significant acquisition of a merchant bank by a bank
from Japan. Guinness Mahon's other leading shareholder is publisher Mr
Robert Maxwell with 9 per cent.
Last year, Guinness Mahon announced losses for the 12 months of Pounds 7.5m
and cut its dividend.

FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Ratners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the reaction to yesterday's figures, investors think Ratners has
turned some kind of corner. The shares have underperformed the market by a
third in a year and by a half over three years, so a change was overdue.
Last year's small rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 112m was a reasonable
performance, especially when measured against other retailers. But there was
no hiding the dilutive effect of the undigested Kay Jewelers acquisition in
the US. Worryingly, too, costs in the UK rose much faster than sales.
Ratners is trying to persuade investors that it has grown up. Out has gone
the image of the mindless pursuit of sales. In its place is a sober
management culture in which costs must be contained to protect the bottom
line from the effects of flattening turnover. It all looks appropriate,
comes perhaps six months late and is arguably inevitable at such a low point
in the economic cycle.
In the medium term, Ratners will push ahead with the integration of Kay in
the US and try to grow organically towards 50 per cent market share in the
UK. Less expansionist shareholders might prefer to see the company
exploiting its UK leadership by forcing immediate price increases on a
sector where volume growth has tailed off. On forecast profits of Pounds
125m, the shares at 177p are on a prospective p/e of nine, backed by a solid
yield of 8 per cent. If Ratners can prove that it has cracked the US market,
its shares will doubtless more than make up lost ground. The rating seems
fair until then.

FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The quirky nature of the latest UK retail sales figure leaves the markets in
the dark on consumer spending just when guidance is most needed. Analysts
were yesterday kicking themselves for forgetting that the last VAT rise in
1979 led to a near-7 per cent jump in sales on the month, followed by a 10
per cent plunge the month after. But the rise in the VAT rate this time is
insignificant compared with last, especially since many retailers were
prompt to announce that they were not passing it on. If there has been a
real underlying recovery, it will be the more welcome after a run of seven
months in which retail volume was down on the year before. It is also the
more vexing to have to wait another month to find out.
That apart, the prospects for a consumer-led recovery are as opaque as ever.
It might be thought that real wage increases would be an important
determinant. But it remains to be seen what will happen if workers settle
for low nominal rises on the basis of plunging headline inflation, only to
find that the stubbornness of core inflation leaves them worse off than
before. The markets may have to settle for guidance on production rather
than consumption. Next Tuesday's quarterly survey from the Confederation of
British Industry, which ought to show the first signs of revival, will be
the most closely scrutinised for a long while.

FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: AT&amp;T/NCR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
American Telephone and Telegraph's five-month bid for NCR looks to be over
bar a little more shouting. Sunday's improved offer from Ma Bell delivers
the Dollars 110 per share demanded by NCR, at least on the basis of the AT&amp;T
price at Friday's close. While the target company is demanding still more
protection for shareholders in the event of AT&amp;T stock slipping back, there
is a limit to which such guarantees can be reasonably extracted.
An agreed deal has always been on the cards, though Wall Street's strength
is helping resolve a corporate battle which has been grubby even by US
standards. AT&amp;T has been beleaguered on several fronts. It may have
scuppered NCR's plan to put 8 per cent of the votes into the hands of its
employees but, as things stand, it is due back in court soon to try to
remove another poison pill. The telecoms giant has managed to unseat only
four members of the NCR board and is faced with the ousted chairman
continuing the fight as chief executive, while staff morale at both
companies may soon become an issue. With all these problems banking up, it
seems prudent to take advantage of the healthier share price, pay a little
more and hope NCR goes quietly.
The all-paper nature of the new offer is crucial, since it would allow AT&amp;T
to account for the takeover without having to write off goodwill against
earnings. AT&amp;T shareholders nevertheless face some short-term dilution. They
will also have a long wait for the benefits, though that is not to say they
will not come. It is just that the precedents for merging computer and
communications businesses - very much a 1980s idea - are not terribly
auspicious.

FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: The Bundesbank marks time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,490.8 (-29.3)
Despite the headlines about the surging dollar, the real story in the
foreign exchange markets still looks to be the weakness of the D-Mark. Given
the dissent among the Group of Seven, there might seem a hint of perversity
about this. Germany argues for monetary tightness and the US for laxity, yet
money continues to flow from the D-Mark to the dollar. Allowing for the
difficulty of measuring the unified German economy, it is not even clear
that money supply growth in the two economies is wildly different by now.
With the help of such mishaps as Chancellor Kohl's election defeat at the
weekend, sentiment on the D-Mark is running downhill.
To an extent, one can see the market's point. The way ahead for the US
economy is pretty clear, apart from matters of timing. The outlook for
Germany is profoundly unclear on virtually everything, including basic
economic policy. The risk premium on the D-Mark, as measured by the interest
rate differential, has been rising steadily for the past six months and now
stands at a full 3 percentage points. For the Bundesbank, the immediate
problem is that the US interest rate cycle may already have hit bottom, so
that a rise in German rates may be needed merely to stop the differential
widening further. It is hard to see how the Bundesbank can reassert its
authority other than by catching the market unawares with the timing and
extent of its next rate rise. By definition, if the Bundesbank gets it right
there could be shocks ahead for the other members of the ERM.

FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: The case for an international adviser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN READING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('The new consensus', April 20 ) spots the irony in the
announcement on the same day last week of Sir Terence Burns' promotion from
chief economic adviser to permanent secretary to the Treasury, with news of
a record rise in unemployment and an accelerating fall in industrial
production. Later you support the need for some sort of National Economic
Assessment - while your Job in the News article below the leader sought a
bright, pragmatic economist for Sir Terence's old job. Following the
failures in economic management in the 1980s, perhaps you should have gone
further.
Fiscal policy is now on auto-pilot and monetary policy is dictated by
exchange rate considerations. British economic prospects depend largely on
what is happening to the rest of the world. The Treasury no longer uses
macro-economic forecasts to steer the economy. Nor does it produce reliable
forecasts for others. This job, and the National Assessment, should be
handed over to independent well-financed economic research institutes.
The Treasury's forecasting errors for the British economy are well known.
But it is possibly worse at predicting international economic prospects on
which our future now rests. The 1990 budget forecasts, for example,
predicted that the US current account deficit and the Japanese surplus would
increase while the large German surplus, despite unification, would remain
broadly unchanged.
This suggests that Sir Terence's old post, as chief economic adviser, might
also be abolished. Instead, the government should appoint an international
economic adviser, so as to be better informed on what is going on in the
rest of the world. Moreover, in looking for candidates, it should consider
an American, German, French or even a Japanese.

FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: Letting up on house pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DB ROBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial (Housing and inflation, April 16) suggests that lowering
the value of housing would help to curb inflation. The only sound long-term
way of reducing price pressure on housing is to increase supply, and that
would naturally follow a full revival of the letting sector.
Sadly, that can happen only when all political parties are in agreement,
since too many fingers have been burnt for landlords to enter the letting
market with confidence.
In the meantime you can hold back house price inflation with high interest
rates in the same way as a dam holds back water - the pent-up demand is
still there, and will manifest itself when it is able to.

FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: Interim solution for Treuhand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'So much to do, so little time' (April 9) mirrors
precisely the fundamental problem of managing change. David Goodhart's
report on the Treuhand's fear that lack of appropriate management resource
could lead to wastage of money on a massive scale echoes the gap being
experienced by many more developed commercial and industrial organisations.
Their recourse has been to interim management.
For a long time the concept of short-term executives has been one of a
stop-gap solution. That this is no longer the case is a tribute to the
high-level experienced people from all over Europe who are prepared to roll
up their sleeves, tackle a specific assignment, achieve significant results
and move on to the next project, adding value through their business skills,
motivation, and lack of emotional excess baggage.
If the Treuhand wishes to attract the type of manager who will enjoy the
challenge of participation in the resurrection of a market economy, the
interim management route is an obvious solution.

FT  23 APR 91 / Visionary seeks an equal chance: Lech Walesa, the Polish
president, who begins a state visit to Britain today, outlines his hopes for
his country's future in an interview with FT writers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's first democratically elected president, Mr Lech Walesa, arrives in
London today for a three-day state visit. He is a complex mixture of
intuitive vision, political shrewdness, religious conviction, unexpected
naivety - and personal charm. It is a combination which helped him play a
key role in the collapse of communism, and is now being used to win Poland a
place in Europe and woo foreign investment.
Last week in Warsaw he talked to FT correspondents about Poland's hopes and
fears, starting with the prospect of 2m unemployed before the year is out.
Q: Will you have to ask Poles for 'blood, sweat and tears'?
A: I don't agree with this perspective. Poland can't afford unemployment. It
has so much work to do, so many needs. Our problem is not over-production
but shortages. We have an educated society but antiquated systems and
machines. That's why we need help from abroad. Even if Poland had twice as
many people we could not catch up with the west in 20 years. So let foreign
business come here, then there won't be unemployment and I can save the
country.
Are you saying there won't be unemployment?
No, no. There could be more than 2m unemployed. The point is there should
not be any, given the size of our needs.
What will you be seeking in Britain?
I'll be doing some blunt talking. Europe is not Europe without Britain, but
there are mistakes in western thinking. Europe fears that we'll take away
markets. But I'm convinced there is work for all here in Poland for 10 years
just to fill in the gaps in our economy. We should learn to assess our
potential on a Europe-wide scale. Look at Nowa Huta (a big steel works). Its
pollution is destroying Krakow. Shouldn't we give up producing steel and buy
from France which has non-polluting factories? But then France has to help
find work for the 60,000 who lose their jobs.
We allow imports of all goods but the west is not buying ours. Why are we
being punished? We could end up like Romania which has nothing but
shortages. If we don't find a common language my farmers won't allow the
import of food from the west. But this is not what should be happening.
We want to join the European institutions. But Europe is afraid to let us
in. Yet, it's so simple. We should all stand at the starting line as if in a
race. I'll be on a bicycle, others on tractors, some in cars. Who wins is
his affair. That's the thinking we should have - everyone should have an
equal chance.
Computers should have a hand in all this. The computer should fire a public
starting signal. It should not be a confidential one so that someone gets an
unfair lead.
That places a lot of faith in computers. Comecon tried that and failed.
That's true. But the first fruit is always full of worms.
What do European leaders say when you make these points to them?
No one has countered my arguments yet. They may complain that the way I put
my views is too brutal but no one has found convincing counter-arguments to
my vision of European development.
Do you see these leaders as short-sighted?
No, but things are changing so fast, and they can't take all factors into
account. I have a great advantage. I'm not tied to any party. Politicians as
a rule are limited by their political affiliations and programmes.
It is said you model yourself on Pilsudski. (Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, who
gained enormous popularity by defeating the Red Army at the gates of Warsaw
in 1920 and later established an increasingly authoritarian regime in the
inter-war years.) Is that right?
No. Of course, I respect Pilsudski. But I'm a different person. Look at the
contrast in our achievements. Pilsudski won great victories with enormous
losses and people were very enthusiastic. We have achieved an enormous
victory over communism without bloodshed - but people aren't happy.
We've achieved so much and so subtly. We've handed Europe victory on a
plate, and the opportunity to link all Europe up on a healthy basis. Yet
just look what Europe is doing. (At this point the president screws up his
face in a gesture of fastidiousness and waves his hands from side to side.)
It does not want to get involved . . . it hums and haws.
Generations have fought for this great chance. Well, now we have it. The
question is, Will we screw it up?
Everything ought to be possible - entry into Nato, into the European
Community, everything. But what are we doing? Just waiting for the next
earthquake. It's amazing. Incredible.
If there'd been the usual victory with corpses all over the place there
would have been enthusiasm.
Somehow everything has changed. It used to be the Germans who did the
fighting and the Jews the trading. Now it's the Germans who are fighting for
peace, the Jews who are fighting and the Poles who are trading. Maybe that's
why things are upside down, everybody is playing unfamiliar roles.
What about the situation to the east?
This is a new era. Of course, new nations and social groups want their
freedom. They are casting aside their chains. Take the Czechs and Slovaks.
Now they're arguing. But this is just the initial phase. After that they'll
start coming together again. Modern economies transcend national boundaries
and dangers like Chernobyl are also no respecter of borders.
Five years ago I said that the Soviet Union had only one option - to
dissolve itself. But no one took me seriously. I'm now saying that it will
dissolve but come together again on new principles, on logical principles.
As for Poland, we need foreign investment because it also gives us security.
Having a Frenchman or an Englishman here with his factory is like having a
division of troops. You in the west have over-production. You can make money
out of our shortages and our stupidity - and we have plenty of that.
We can't just escape in your direction because it is already full up. I want
to turn round the escape routes. That's where business can be done. Business
should come here rather than wait for people to flee west. Come and set up a
factory here. Make money.
Some people say, 'Walesa is selling Poland cheap'. Our people are
intelligent but we received our education under communism. We need western
help to show us how to do things. We don't want charity or sentiment. We
have to be taught in the brutal school of life. The quicker we start the
quicker we'll learn.
You won power because the communists could not deliver economically. But
aren't things getting worse for many?
If I was to run for election now I'd get 90 per cent. The new government
(led by the prime minister Mr Jan Bielecki) is full of competent people.
True, they are from the third division. They're not well-known. But that's
how I wanted it. They want to join the first division and they'll work hard
to get there. You know how the first division acts. They sit there smoking
their pipes and thinking about things. That's OK in other conditions but not
now.
I'm a man who gets down to resolving problems. I don't ask whether it's the
done way or not. I raise issues. People don't always understand my motives.
But the president must always have answers and propose his own solutions -
he can't allow himself to be taken by surprise. I'm not taking a
conventional approach and you should be careful how you assess what I am
doing.
My role is a fluid one, searching for solutions and forcing people into
democracy. Let parliament get angry. Let them rebel. I want to force people
to think. I want to provoke them out of the theories of communism.
After 50 years of communism you cannot just impose a better system on
people. The thing is to provoke them and point them in the right direction.
But if there was a threat (to democracy) and events go in a wrong direction
then something decisive would have to be done.
We won't get to democracy with an apathetic society. People have been fooled
by politicians in the past and have to understand what's going on. That's
why I provoke them into arguing and thinking. I don't want them sitting on
sofas smoking pipes. That's for 50 years' time.

FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: Pensions below 60 still a matter of discretion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL GREENWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Waters' article on pensions in the Finance Bill ('Revenue paves
way for curbs', April 18) gives a strong inference that pension ages below
60 are no longer allowed in any circumstance.
The change in clause 33 of the Finance Bill amending allowable retirement
ages applies only to schemes approved by the Inland Revenue under mandatory
approval.
Few occupational schemes are approved under this route. The vast majority,
probably more than 99 per cent, are approved under Revenue discretionary
approval. The clauses on discretionary approval give the Inland Revenue very
wide powers. For instance, in some circumstances for certain occupations,
footballers and deep sea divers for example, they have approved pension
schemes with normal pension ages considerably below those allowed under
mandatory approval. There is nothing in the Finance Bill which changes or
restricts such practice.
The Inland Revenue is believed to be currently reviewing its discretionary
practices. An announcement is now expected in September in the form of the
issue of new Inland Revenue Practice Notes. These notes summarise how it
exercises its discretion granted to its under the legislation. It could well
be that for ordinary schemes under its discretionary powers the Inland
Revenue restricts pension ages to the band from age 60 to 75, irrespective
of sex.
However, until the issue of new Practice Notes or some other announcement,
it is not actually known what the Inland Revenue's attitude with regard to
pension ages will be for the vast majority of pension schemes.

FT  23 APR 91 / Leading Article: The price of British gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most important moments so far in the short history of regulating
Britain's privatised but still over-mighty utilities is almost upon us.
British Gas is in the final stages of negotiations with its regulator, the
Office of Gas Supply, to determine the formula which will set the prices
paid by 17m domestic gas customers from April 1992.
The Ofgas review of domestic prices began in June of last year and has been
a wide-ranging affair. It needs to be; last year, gas prices went up twice -
by 7.5 per cent in March and by between 3.3 and 3.7 per cent in November.
These increases were justified under the current formula, which links the
price of gas to the retail price index, minus 'x', plus 'y', where 'x' is a
2 per cent efficiency factor and 'y' is the cost to British Gas itself of
obtaining raw fuel.
It is to be hoped that Ofgas, with the help of two external accountants, is
taking a robustly sceptical view of both the 'x' and 'y' factors. Although
the British Gas publicity machine has been active in recent months in
presenting the results of its own customer surveys, there remains a
suspicion that this private sector near-monopoly still needs to shed more
than a few pounds in weight. It has not, to take just one example, been
driving particularly hard bargains on the pay front.
Searching inquiry
As for the cost of British Gas's raw materials, there are also good grounds
for searching inquiry. The company's dominance of the retail market does not
necessarily give it the strongest possible incentive to obtain the lowest
cost supplies and there is, at the very least, room to question British
Gas's efficiency as an operator of its own gas fields. At the point of
privatisation, it was impossible for any outsider to unscramble British
Gas's accounts to make a fair judgment on these points. Ofgas will have let
down gas customers very badly if it has failed to sort out the figures.
Ofgas has also served notice that it intends to reconsider the appropriate
return for British Gas, the value of its assets and new ways in which it can
be held accountable for standards of service.
The next stage of this lengthy process, due in the next week, is that
British Gas has to inform Ofgas whether it accepts the regulator's proposed
pricing formula. If it does not, the matter is automatically referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission for detailed examination.
MMC involvement
There is a very strong case for MMC involvement, not least because it would
expose to public scrutiny the detail of Ofgas's case and British Gas's
response. One of the biggest problems caused by the misjudged privatisation
of British Gas, which was allowed to keep most of its monopoly power, is
that the kind of public disclosure which was to some extent required of a
nationalised industry can now be resisted on grounds of commercial
confidentiality.
As the rules stand, however, British Gas can avoid a bruising run-in with
the MMC simply by agreeing to the Ofgas plan. It is to be hoped, in that
event, that one element in the Ofgas proposal is that there should be full
public exposure of its analysis. There is no point in Ofgas setting itself
up as a policeman of the meter man's punctuality if its essential
calculations about prices are lost in obscurity.
Nor should the politicians who designed the regulatory regime in gas make
the mistake of thinking that these are matters of little interest to voters.
Energy prices are uncontroversial so long as they are relatively stable. But
the new gas price formula will cover the period from 1992 to 1997. It will
only take a modest oil and gas price shock in that period to turn the arcane
algebra of Ofgas into front page news.
Regulating a company as powerful as British Gas is not easy, and so far
Ofgas has had only modest success in stimulating competition in the
industrial gas market. For domestic customers, Ofgas looks like remaining
the only protection against the abuse of monopoly power. That is why its
next move on prices needs to be rigorous and visibly so.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One person who won't be at today's annual general meeting of National
Westminster Bank - although he probably should be - is John Tugwell who has
been handed the unhappy job of sorting out NatWest Bancorp. He is the one
banker who knows how bad things really are at NatWest's problematic US
subsidiary.
Then again, since he arrived in New York less than a fortnight ago and only
five days before NatWest Bancorp revealed it lost Dollars 191m in the first
quarter, perhaps his absence can be excused.
Even by US banking standards NatWest Bancorp has been doing pretty badly,
and 50-year-old Tugwell says he has been working day and night since he
first arrived. He has rented an apartment on Manhattan's East side and is
intent on rallying his 7,500 troops by being NatWest's man in the trouble
spot.
Parachuting Tugwell into the top spot at NatWest Bancorp is a risk both for
him and his employer. Having been involved in the 1977-78
acquisition of National Bank of North America, he is closely associated with
NatWest's expensive acquisition strategy in the US. With interest rates
falling there, the injection of yet more of the parent's capital means
Tugwell may be able to stage-manage an impressive turnaround.
If he can, then he's well placed to follow in the footsteps of Tom Frost,
NatWest's chief executive, who made his name in the US. But if matters take
a turn for the worse,
Tugwell could face a similar fate to Midland Bank's John Harris. Once viewed
as the next chief executive, Harris never recovered from being sent to keep
an eye on Midland's disastrous Crocker acquisition in California.
Unlike Harris, who had to work alongside a US chief executive, Tugwell has
been given sole responsibility for NatWest's US operations. It is make or
break time all round.

After excellent vintages for three years running, Bordeaux faces a black
year in 1991 as a result of a sharp bout of frost over the weekend.
In itself, frost is not all that unusual at this time of year. But the
attack last Saturday night fell in parts as low as - 7 deg C, and it
followed a particularly mild spell which had brought on the vegetation of
the vines unexpectedly early.
In consequence, the total Bordeaux vintage this year is already expected to
drop by around half, from 800m to 400m bottles. Moreover, not merely will
the quantity be down, the quality will also be jeopardised.
Some vineyards will be much worse hit than the average; the harvest in Medoc
may be down by 70 per cent, and the vintage in some individual vineyards in
St Emilion, Graves, Entre-Deux-Mers and Pomerol may be completely wiped out.
Wine experts, who last year were groping for superlatives to describe the
recent run of superb vintages, are now groping for comparisons for an
equally disastrous frost.

There is an awful lot of humbug talked about top executives' pay. Even so
the news that Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco's retailing superstar, is taking home
Pounds 1.5m is bound to raise eyebrows.
He is not in the same league as Sir Ralph Halpern, Burton's ex-chief
executive, and he has made a lot of money for Tesco shareholders. But the
problem with such seemingly massive pay increases today is twofold.
They send the wrong sort of signal to a workforce under pressure to squeeze
costs.
Second, tying management incentive schemes so closely to earnings-per-share
growth - perhaps at the expense of balance sheet prudence - can be
dangerous.
It is time companies spelt out the terms of their executive incentive
schemes in the annual report right from the start. Then bonanzas like
MacLaurin's would not be such a surprise.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget the opening of Miss Saigon on Broadway. It will be thoroughly
upstaged by this year's biggest first night on October 12, bringing the
first performance of John Godber's comedy Happy Families at the Caxton
Theatre in Grimsby . . . the Questor's in Ealing . . . the Progress, Reading
. . . not to mention 47 more.
The whole lot are building their autumn season of amateur theatricals around
the play, thanks to what used to be called British Telecom which has
extended its arts sponsorship into the cut-throat world of amateur
dramatics.
Sponsors usually avoid amateurs like the plague. But when consultant James
Cook proposed the commissioning of a new play for simultaneous performances
by the 64-strong Little Theatre Guild, BT saw the PR possibilities.
The idea has been taken up by 50 members of the guild, which represents the
top league of Britain's 12,000 theatrical groups. In July all the directors
involved will gather at the BT Training Centre to be guided by Godber, who
has written Happy Families with amateurs in mind - a cast of a dozen,
heavily weighted towards women.
The event will cost BT around Pounds 50,000, and be repeated in two years
time, perhaps with Alan Ayckbourn as the playwright in charge. The sponsor
will use the first nights for entertaining customers. You have been warned.

FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Osud - Semper Opera, Dresden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One's heart goes out to Dresden. With blackened stone ruins still peering
out of the rubble in parts of the city centre and socialist architecture
dominating the rest, the people now face another form of reconstruction -
their economy, their livelihood, their self-esteem.
With industry at a standstill, tens of thousands out of work and a growing
disillusionment with the promises made at reunification, what priority does
music have in people's lives? The city's two main music institutions - the
Semper Opera and the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra  - will survive, but
much of the cultural substructure will not. The first night of Osud was less
than three-quarters full. That says less about the Dresdeners' lack of
curiosity (or about ticket prices, which are still extremely low), than that
they have other preoccupations in these hard times.
Osud marks the end of an era: it is Joachim Herz's last production in
Dresden. He has worked there in comparative obscurity for the past ten
years, but his production style and cantankerous personality have made him
superfluous to the incoming artistic team led by Christoph Albrecht. Herz's
decision to take the Saxon state government to court over the ending of his
contract makes a sad spectacle.
Osud illustrated two classic traits in postwar German opera production - a
natural animation of the stage, releasing the inner impetus of the music,
which is Herz's inheritance from Walter Felsenstein; and a congenital
tendency to over-interpret. Act one was beautiful. Reinhart Zimmermann's
permanent set consisted of a gently stepped wooden platform, which together
with Eleonore Kleiber's costumes preserved the period charm of Janacek's
setting. Behind lay a wall of large slanted mirrors, reflecting the stations
in Zivny's relationship with Mila - the first rapture of eyes meeting, the
exchange of roses after one of Zivny's concerts. But the chief distinction
lay in Herz's choreography of the spa scenes - the sedate bourgeoisie, the
carefree couples, the brood of schoolgirls - so that everyone on stage was
an individual, without a trace of the artificial movement that has become
synonymous with Herz's successors at the Komische Oper.
The domestic setting of Act two was suggested by little more than a settee,
a kitchen dresser and a precipitous flight of stairs. Here Herz depicted the
interlocking pressures on Zivny - mother-in-law, creative crisis, marriage
strains, alcohol problem - through a series of equally convincing vignettes.
Having respected Janacek's awkward but viable dramatic outline thus far,
Herz then made a complete mess of the final act. Zivny's tortured solos were
transposed to the beginning, as he wrestled with skeletons of the past
(bombed-out buildings, machine-gunfire and the usual German militaristic
cliches) in an attempt to reactivate his creative inspiration. After a
shortened conservatoire scene, with Mila reincarnated as the impressionable
student Souckova, Zivny ended up in a mental clinic. For anyone who saw the
ENO and Dusseldorf stagings in the mid-1980s, both of which were faithful to
Janacek's original, Herz's solution was nothing more than a piece of
interpretative hack-work.
No such reservations about the musical performance, which was consistently
inspired. The rhythmic buoyancy and clean, light-fingered articulation of
the orchestral playing under Hans Zimmer showed that the Staatskapelle can
be as idiomatic in Janacek as they are in Richard Strauss. Zivny was sung by
Michael Rabsilber, whose pointed Germanic high tenor and sensitive acting
made him a near-ideal interpreter. In spite of being handicapped by dark
glasses and a spooky white cape, Kerstin Witt as Mila's mother acted the
disintegrating old harridan to the hilt. But the chief glory of the
performance lay in Vlatka Orsanic's Mila, a vibrant, radiant soprano who
phrased her soaring lines with moving eloquence.

FT  23 APR 91 / Management (The Growing Business): Clubbing together in a
local network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities should be required to assess the economic impact on small
and medium-sized businesses of all policy proposals they make. This is one
of the recommendations made in a study* of local support networks carried
out by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte and Business in the Community.
Councillors and local government officers should be encouraged to think
through the impact of their programmes on local firms with the aim of
reducing the burden on business.
The models for this suggestion are the economic impact assessments required
by the European Commission and the UK government on draft legislation.
A first step to building a healthy local business environment is to identify
key players in the community, the study says. These would include the local
council, businesses, the Training and Enterprise Council (Tec), enterprise
agencies, chamber of commerce and higher education.
These organisations should agree the outline of the future economic
development of the area and identify their role in achieving it.
Enterprise agencies should be best placed to counsel small businesses; the
chamber could provide information on continental European markets; while the
local authority economic development unit might have details of sites
available.
The availability of information about local business support also needs to
be improved, the report says. Businesses requiring assistance should be able
to get help by making not more than two telephone calls. Many organisations
advocate the grouping of different help organisations under one roof but the
development of information technology makes this less necessary, the study
argues.
However, the use of information technology between providers of business
support is patchy and compares unfavourably with the systems in use in
continental Europe.
The study urges better publicity about business support groups through the
publication of directories and free magazines. The local authority also has
an important role to fulfil in promoting a positive image of the area.
As a next step Business in the Community has set up a target team to
investigate good practice in other European countries which could be applied
in the UK.

FT  23 APR 91 / Management (The Growing Business): Lower overheads and
increased productivity: Subcontracting - Charles Batchelor on the benefits
of off-site production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Holdings, a Slough-based company which supplies audio equipment to
schools, is well into a programme to run down its own manufacturing
operations and to subcontract the work to Remploy, which provides
manufacturing services to a wide range of businesses.
Elf will cease manufacturing at its Brighton factory and hand over
responsibility for making products such as cassette recorders and public
address systems to Remploy's factory in Islington, north London. Some of the
Brighton employees will switch to repair and service work but the overall
result will be the loss of 10 jobs, reducing Elf's workforce to 22 people.
Chris Crump, managing director of Elf, expects that the move to
subcontracting will reduce production costs and relieve it of the burden of
coping with an uneven order flow. (Remploy produces for many companies so it
can control its own workload.)
Elf, which has sales of Pounds 2m, will assemble kits of components and
deliver them to Remploy though it may later arrange for its suppliers to
deliver directly to the subcontractor.
Crump, who joined Elf a year ago to ginger up a flagging performance, says
he considered moving production to Slough but this would still have required
him to make a judgment on the size of the workforce he would need to meet
fluctuating demand. Sourcing products from the Far East was not an option
either because schools frequently require modifications to the standard
items Elf supplies.
The complexity of many products has meant that large companies in areas such
as automobile manufacture and engineering have long moved to extensive
subcontracting of specialised components. Increasingly, smaller companies
are turning to subcontracting, either to reduce the cost of getting started
or to bring down the overheads of a long-established activity.
Small and medium-sized businesses, those employing fewer than 500 people,
account for no less than 82 per cent of Remploy's customers and 61 per cent
of its turnover, the company calculates.
'It is even more important for the smaller company, with its limited
resources, to focus on certain activities and subcontract out the rest,'
says Brian Small, managing director of Ingersoll Engineers, a Rugby-based
consultancy.
The present recession, which has made companies even more aware of the need
to reduce costs, is providing a spur for more businesses to subcontract out
parts of their operations. Manufacturing savings, together with reductions
in other areas such as premises and stocks can allow businesses to finance
the restructuring of their operations from their own resources, says Small.
Frequently the crunch comes when a business decides it needs to modernise
its production capacity. Gent, a Leicester-based manufacturer of fire
detection and alarm equipment, took a hard look at its metal fabrication
shop when it was planning a move to a new factory.
'We had lots of ancient small presses and turning machines making rings,
contacts, even screws,' says Andrew Robinson, managing director. 'We
realised our main strength was electronics so we didn't want dirty, oily
activities alongside. In addition our tooling was getting old and it would
have taken a big investment to replicate.'
Gent, which has sales of Pounds 24m and which forms part of RTZ Corporation,
shed most of its metal fabrication activities. The buy-in value of the
abandoned components was only Pounds 500,000 a year and the profit
improvement was less than Pounds 100,000 but the saving in terms of the
'distraction value' to management of these peripheral activities was
significant, Robinson says.
But there are further considerable benefits to be gained from buying in or
subcontracting parts of a company's activities:
Deciding to buy in rather than make can have an important impact on the
market-awareness of a company, argues Brian Small. Companies which make a
fetish of manufacturing all or most of the components required are less
likely to be oriented towards the needs of their customers.
Small businesses may be able to improve quality control by handing over
responsibility for manufacturing to a large, more sophisticated
subcontractor. 'If something goes wrong Remploy's quality control can pick
it up,' says Robert Belcher, managing director of Manrose Manufacturing, a
supplier of domestic fans. Both Remploy and Manrose's supplier of plastic
mouldings have obtained BS5750, the main UK standard for quality control,
but Manrose itself has yet to qualify. Increasingly, customers are requiring
suppliers to conform to this standard.
A subcontractor can help a customer even out uneven order flows and hold-ups
in the supply of components. Hayward Tyler Fluid Dynamics, a Luton-based
manufacturer of specialised pumps, has subcontracted out fabrication and
plating operations accounting for 5-10 per cent of total activities as part
of a far-reaching restructuring programme. Hayward Tyler employs 250 people,
down from 440, and has sales of Pounds 20m.
'This will give us flexibility,' says Roger Harrop, chief executive of
Hayward Tyler and of its parent company, Sterling Fluid Systems. 'It will be
easier to switch off a subcontractor than our own people.' The company's
plating shop had anyway only been used for three days a month, he adds.
Sub-contracting can also improve a company's cash flow. Instead of paying
weekly wages to the shop floor workforce the company moves to paying the
subcontractor on 30 or 60-day terms. The company can also set the cost of
the subcontractor's services immediately against profits whereas investment
in capital equipment usually takes place over a number of years.
But the decision to subcontract out parts or even all of a business's
manufacturing operations can be highly charged. Some companies believe the
benefits of subcontracting outweigh the loss of total control of their
activities. Others are sensitive about admitting that they are sticking
their own label on someone else's product.
Production specialists say that before considering whether to buy-in rather
than make a particular item managers must decide which activities are core
to their company's survival. High value items and products which involve
confidential design features and manufacturing techniques should always be
made in-house, says James Byers of Ingersoll Engineers. Stock items such as
nuts, bolts, bearings and washers, or loss-makers essential to the company's
range should be contracted out.
In addition, managers must be prepared for a short-term disruption of
production when they subcontract work out. 'We had a few teething problems
in the first six months,' says Gent's Andrew Robinson. 'It was not easy to
get someone else to make items which our own skilled workers had been making
for 20 years.'
Managers must monitor the relationship with the subcontractor very closely.
One start-up business which subcontracted out the plastic injection moulding
on which it depended was set back for a year when it was forced to replace a
large number of products which customers returned as being faulty. 'We
assumed there would be someone at the subcontractor who had an overall view
of the project but there wasn't,' says the company's executive director.
But the difficulties do not always lie with the subcontractor. Companies are
frequently unrealistic in their forecasts of production volumes, says Edward
Selby, business manager of Remploy's southern region factories. Managers
sometimes misjudge the market for their product but they may also
deliberately exaggerate volumes to negotiate a keen price from the
subcontractor.
Nor is it unknown for managers to order wildly excessive volumes of raw
materials. 'If a customer thinks his product will sell for a number of years
he buys a massive quantity of raw materials. If a juggernaut pulls up
outside your door with three years' worth of materials it is difficult to
tell the customer you can't let them in,' Selby explains. Subcontracting
should not be seen as an easy way of disposing of the complexities of
running a manufacturing operation, the experts warn. But properly handled it
can have a significant impact on costs and on the ability of a smaller
company to service its customers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH venture capital companies are increasingly willing to consider
making direct investments in small publicly-listed companies, according to
UK Venture Capital Journal*. This would mark a significant shift in the
industry's traditional role and could confuse investor perceptions of
venture capital.
The journal signals three reasons for this development:
The increasing size of venture capital investments in recent years, in
particular the industry's involvement in financing buy-outs, means there
would be little difference in scale between the funding needs of quoted and
unquoted companies. Thirty four per cent of the 1,700 companies with a full
stock market listing are capitalised at less than Pounds 20m while 70 per
cent are valued at less than Pounds 100m.
There is little difference between the management style of smaller quoted
companies and those remaining private.
As their portfolios mature more venture capital com-panies have holdings in
com-panies which have obtained a listing.
Investments in listed companies are potentially attractive because they are
more easily disposed of while smaller quoted companies have traditionally
outperformed large companies, the journal notes.
On the downside venture capitalists might be hard put to explain to their
own backers why they should invest in quoted companies by means of a venture
capital company when they could invest directly in the stock exchange. The
venture capitalist would also have difficulties gaining the same detailed
information from a listed company that he demands when making a private
company investment. Despite these drawbacks more venture capitalists are
inserting discreet clauses in their fund-raising prospectus which would
allow them to make direct investments in listed companies, the journal
notes.
Among recent listed company deals it identifies a Pounds 14.2m investment in
Hunter Saphir, a food group, in the form of convertible preference shares,
by 3i, County NatWest Ventures and CIN Venture Managers. *12 Barley Mow

FT  23 APR 91 / Technology: Technically Speaking - Software directive makes
users losers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Computing policy is undoubtedly too important to be left entirely to the
technical experts, but problems arise when officials and politicians try to
resolve arguments between differing computer factions without fully
understanding the implications of their actions.
Look at the current state of affairs resulting from Brussels' seemingly
meritorious efforts over the past couple of years to protect suppliers of
computer software from piracy, a mess compounded by the peculiar procedural
requirements of the European Parliament.
To recap briefly. Two years ago, an EC directive was drafted with the aim of
harmonising measures to outlaw software piracy across the member states.
It specifically forbade unauthorised reverse engineering - analysing a piece
of software to understand what its does and how it does it. That proposal
was flawed in that while reverse engineering is used by software pirates, it
is also a key technology for computer manufacturers. They need to be able to
attach their equipment to that of their competitors; computer users have to
be able to modify and extend their existing software.
It is unlikely the authors of the draft fully understood the implications of
their work. The directive suited PC software suppliers and the larger
manufacturers - namely IBM and Digital Equipment - but outraged their
smaller competitors and customers. The competitors, including Groupe Bull
and Olivetti, formed a lobby called the European Committee for Interoperable
Systems (ECIS); users formed the Computer Users of Europe.
There was a second dimension. IBM and Digital saw the directive as a way of
defending their software against the Japanese. The issue became a war or
words fought between the US and Japan in the cockpit of Europe.
Commissioners in Brussels and Members of the European Parliament in
Strasbourg are by now no doubt heartily sick of the issue. They have been
lobbied mercilessly by representatives from all sides of the dispute for the
past 12 months.
A compromise solution or 'Common Position' was reached in December which
proved satisfactory to the software suppliers and the big computer
manufacturers, but left ECIS together with computer users across Europe
concerned about the legitimacy of reverse engineering for maintenance or to
facilitate the interconnection of one maker's computer with another.
These issues were addressed in a series of amendments which came before the
European parliament last week. Some 235 MEPs voted for the amendments, 89
voted against and 197 abstained. But under EC rules a minimum of 260 MEPs
have to vote in favour of an issue for it to pass.
The directive now goes back to Brussels for final ratification later this
year. Some nations - the Netherlands, Italy and Spain among them - are
expected to adopt the measures as they stand; France, Germany and the UK
will have to modify their existing copyright law.
The overall result is that the big manufacturers and the software suppliers
seem to have all they wanted; the smaller manufacturers are discontented but
prepared to live within the terms of the directive while users are confused
and angry.
What is now likely to happen is a series of court battles in each member
state as users squabble among themselves to define the exact interpretation
of the directive with regard to reverse engineering. There is still the
possibility that new proposals can be put to the Commission after the
effects of the directive have been assessed in practice. Perhaps the
commission's own drafting mechanism would benefit from a spot of reverse
engineering?

FT  23 APR 91 / Technology: At the sharp end of a supply chain - Dave Madden
explains how United Stationers has turned the distribution of its goods into
a fine art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVE MADDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Distribution is one of the duller business ghettos - dusty warehouses,
broken pallets and diesel oil. But the image, and the reality, are beginning
to change.
As Fiat shows off its robot-controlled inventory stacks in glossy
advertisements and IBM switches off the lights in its automated warehouse in
Greenock, it is clear that this Cinderella operation has a new set of
high-tech glad rags.
Britain's high street retailer Marks and Spencer has long appreciated that
sophisticated distribution processes are an important part of supply chain
management. They influence customer loyalty, product differentiation and
profit margins. According to Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler: 'The company
with the best distribution systems and service level will win all the
marbles.'
In short, advanced logistics is no longer a luxury. One consequence of this
shift is the emergence of a new type of wholesale service company where
distribution is just as important as the product that is shipped.
Take paper clips. If you are an office products wholesaler, how do you get
retailers to buy such a simple, undifferentiated item from you, rather than
from any number of your competitors?
The answer, in the US at least, is 'value-added' distribution. United
Stationers, the country's biggest office products distributor, can sell and
ship a single pencil or one box of paper clips and still make a profit.
The same is true on all 25,000 items in its catalogue, from pens to filing
cabinets. And if a customer places an order by 6.00 pm it will be delivered
by 9.00 am the next morning to any location in the US.
Not surprisingly, this demands an extensive physical operation. United
Stationers, based near Chicago, sells products from around 400 manufacturers
to some 10,000 retailers across the US, via 14 regional distribution
centres.
This physical network is entirely dependent on a complex computing and
telecommunications infrastructure: Amdahl 5995 and IBM 3090 mainframes
supported by robotic storage devices from Storage Technology as well as
telephone and satellite communications networks. In all an incremental
investment of some Dollars 200m (Pounds 115m).
United's customers obtain information on the company's inventory via a
computer network which connects their machines to United's system of 1,400
PCs. This automates the ordering process and allows clients to see whether
United has a particular product in stock.
'Our customers enter upwards of 70 per cent of our orders for us,' says
Patrick Murray, IT vice president. 'We do it in lots of different ways. We
talk to everybody's computer. We do it in batch mode, we do it online -
however a customer requires it.'
Ultimately, Murray expects United's terminals to be on the desks of his
customers' customers too, and he intends to apply the same technology to
links with his own suppliers.
Ordering is only part of the value-added process. The sooner the retailer
knows that United has shipped goods, the sooner he can bill his customer and
collect his money, says Murray. Similarly United uses the system to get the
latest manufacturers' pricing information to these retailers, so that they
can manage their prices too.
Giving retailers such access to and control over the ordering and inventory
process, and the imperative to turn orders around in hours, has had serious
implications for United's warehousing operation.
Items are not stored in pre-defined areas. Rather, they are put in the next
available bin, as dictated by United's disparate product range: boxes of
pencils and desks do not take up the same shaped space. The warehouse map is
computer-controlled and the system tracks every individual batch of items.
Surprisingly, this random binning is not completely arbitrary. The system is
able to analyse the inventory and track 'hot' products - high moving items -
and guide them to where they are most accessible.
When a piece of inventory is manually put into store, staff use radio
frequency data entry terminals, complete with bar-coded reading guns, to
update the control system directly on line.
The logical extension of all this, says Murray, is to use similar tools and
the same bar code in the transportation and delivery process so that a
driver can verify that the right carton has been dropped at the right door,
and give proof of delivery. United hopes to introduce such an innovation
this year.
The same integrated technology feeds United's sales and marketing effort.
Its primary marketing tool is a catalogue of products, and United publishes
and distributes some 4m copies a year.
But because the catalogue becomes out of date almost immediately after it is
issued (with products being added or dropped), Murray has to provide regular
updates. He is hoping in the near future, however, to produce an electronic
catalogue, with colour pictures, dimension data and moving price
information.
At the hub of United's operation is a central IT development and operations
staff. Typically this is pared to the bone - 40 people to manage data and
voice communications, systems operations and a help desk (there is no
computer expertise in the regional centres). In addition, Murray has 100
staff in applications development and product introduction.
The effect of this technological commitment is two fold, Murray says. First,
United has grown significantly - it is now a Dollars 1bn company, and one of
just four national office products distributors in the US. Second, its
technology culture has enabled United to set pioneering service levels.
For example, Murray explains: 'We are doing lots of small orders. About 80
per cent of what we sell is not in the same packaging that it came to us in.
We don't sell a whole carton of paper - we'll sell one ream. Now the service
we provide for our reseller says you go out to each of your customers and
you take the orders the way they want them.
'You send the orders to us and we'll package them in such a way that they
can be delivered directly to the end user and you don't have to add labour.
When we put the label on the box the label says it came from you not from
us. Our dealer doesn't have to handle the merchandise at all. The most
profitable dealer is the guy who never sees the merchandise, absolutely
never sees it at all.'
The downside is that higher expectations become institutionalised. Because
United delivers anywhere in the US by the following day, and guarantees to
be in stock on all of its inventory, that has become the service norm.
Similarly United cannot afford to let up on its technical innovation. Murray
claims that the company currently has a lead of six to 12 months, but 'the
competition is pretty good at copying - so we better have the next thing
coming up to keep the gap open. To get the order we've got to be the easiest
company to do business with,' he says.

FT  23 APR 91 / Technology: Digital's load gets lighter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNTON MCLAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the price of computers has halved over the past five years, the cost
of distributing the finished product has continued to rise. Faced with the
need to sell twice as many computers just to maintain revenues, computer
companies have begun to focus on how they can reduce the cost of their
distribution systems.
Digital Equipment, with European sales of Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 3bn) in
1989/90, has halved its distribution costs over the past five years. One way
it has done this is by cutting the computers in stock, down from 12 weeks'
supply to three and a half weeks.
Further ways of cutting the costs have been created at Digital's European
distribution centre in the Netherlands. Staff at the Utrecht centre no
longer carry order papers around the warehouse. Instead, the warehouse is
served by fork-lift trucks fitted with small keyboards, visual display units
and a miniature laser gun for reading barcodes.
The day starts with the driver signing on to the computer and taking note of
the first instruction of the day. This information consists of a string of
numbers which defines the precise location of the computer to be collected,
including the aisle, shelf and position of the computer in its box as well
as the order for the computers to be stacked, with the most robust equipment
at the bottom. When the driver approaches the box he confirms it is the
correct one by reading the barcode label on the side with the laser gun.
'The technique eliminates all possibilities for error,' says Co Berendsen,
manager of the Utrecht centre. An attempt by a driver to collect the wrong
box generates a warning signal and if he ignores this he will not receive
instructions for his next collection.
Berendsen says that the introduction of radio communications has cut the
time taken by the fork lift trucks to do the job by 40 per cent. 'Accuracy
has also increased and the trucks no longer do journeys around the warehouse
without a load.'

A LABOUR government would require industry to give full details of all
pollution it emits, Ms Ann Taylor, the party's environment spokesman said
yesterday.
The flow of information on the environment would also be improved by the
setting up of a national inventory of toxic waste emissions. Other proposals
included the ending of international trade in toxic waste. Ms Taylor said it
was wrong that Britain should be 'a dustbin for other countries'.

FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tories to direct fire at Labour
over-spending: Local Elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY's expected announce-ment of the proposed replacement for the poll tax
will signal a Tory bid to fight the second half of the local election
campaign on their own terms - by directing attention at high-spending Labour
councils.
Foreshadowing the new phase of the campaign, Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party
chairman, yesterday launched a document giving examples of Labour
'mismanagement, inefficiency, failure and lunacy', such as the
non-collection of council rents, and high levels of debt per head.
'They don't collect the money owed to them, they fritter away funds on
pointless projects, and they obstruct competition for local services,' he
said.
Tomorrow's press conference - only the party's second of the campaign - will
see Mr Patten, together with Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment
secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, emphasise
the claim: 'Conservative councillors cost you less.'
The Tories' determination to put their poll tax troubles behind them was
underlined in a speech by Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, as he
called on the party to unite behind the prime minister and the party's
central beliefs.
'The Conservatives united are an almost unbeatable force; the Conservatives
disunited are not long off the opposition benches,' he said.
Labour, however, remains confident that the method of financing local
government will continue to be the main issue in the campaign, and that the
government's proposals are still vulnerable.
The opposition has changed its earlier tactics of attacking the new charge
as the 'son of poll tax'.
It has tacitly admitted that the new tax is different by publishing a range
of ministerial criticisms of a property tax, to indicate the likely extent
of disagreement among Tory MPs over the basis of the system.
'There is root and branch opposition to any form of property tax from the
top to the bottom of today's Tory party,' Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment
secretary said yesterday.
While Labour officials acknowledge that the party may not be able
convincingly to accuse the new charge of being a form of poll tax, they
believe it will still be attacked as unfair and too complex.
The opposition will point, in particular, to the way in which a banding
system will reduce the progressive nature of the tax, the use of capital
values alone to determine the band into which property falls and the fact
that the single-person discount is not linked to ability to pay.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, also cast doubt on
the trustworthiness of the amounts for projected bills under the new system,
claiming they were 'fairy-tale figures'.

FT  23 APR 91 / Silver shines amid antiques-trade recession: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE market, that for silver, seems to have bucked the recession in the
antiques trade. London dealers were busy in New York at the weekend paying
extraordinary prices for silver and other ornate works of art.
SJ Phillips gave Dollars 159,500 (Pounds 92,544) for a Louis XIV silver
pitcher, made by Francois Guillou, which had belonged to Henry Ford II and
carried an estimate of just Dollars 25,000. The same dealer paid Dollars
330,000 (estimate Dollars 80,000) for an ornate French silver, gold, and
hardstone neo-Gothic clock set with emeralds, made in 1881.
Another London dealer, Partridge, secured for Dollars 66,000 an English
Victorian parcel gilt 'Gothic' ewer set with enamel and jewels, made in
Birmingham in 1855 by John Hardman. In 1983 it was sold for Dollars 5,000.
One of the rare private collections of pre-revolution French silver sold for
Dollars 2m at Christie's. All the 72 lots found buyers. The collection had
been assembled by the late Rodolphe and Williamina Meyer de Schauensee.
English furniture was less popular at Sotheby's, and a pair of George III
kingwood and satinwood parquetry collector's cabinets of about 1770 sold for
Dollars 88,000, below forecast.
At Christie's, however, there was a satisfactory price of Dollars 660,000
paid for a George III walnut and parcel gilt secretaire-bookcase made in the
mid-18th century.
Buying was selective in an auction of Chinese export porcelain and works of
art at Christie's in London yesterday. Two large 19th century hand scrolls
depicting battle scenes doubled their forecast, selling for Pounds 24,200 to
London dealer Sydney Moss. But an interesting punch bowl made in China in
the late 18th century was bought in at Pounds 7,000.

FT  23 APR 91 / Names allege that Lloyd's kept them 'in the dark'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Names were kept 'in the dark' about the true state of loss-making
Lloyd's syndicates that they backed in the early 1980s, Mr Michael
Lyndon-Stanford, QC, alleged yesterday in the High Court in London.
Mr Lyndon-Stanford, representing 24 Names on syndicates managed by Oakeley
Vaughan Underwriting Agents, now in liquidation, was outlining why the Names
are taking action against the Corporation of Lloyd's.
Nine other Oakeley Vaughan Names are consenting to the action while 15 more
Oakeley Names are involved in supplemental actions.
The case, in which the Oakeley Vaughan Names allege that the Corporation of
Lloyd's was negligent in failing to supervise the Lloyd's insurance market,
was adjourned yesterday until Monday. The delay is necessary to allow the
judge, Mr Justice Gatehouse, to study extensive background documentation.
The 24 plaintiffs suffered gross losses of more than Pounds 5m as a result
of their membership of syndicates 168, 420/423, 551 and 862 in the 1980,
1981 and 1982 underwriting years.
Total losses by the 250 or so Names who were members of the syndicates
amounted to more than Pounds 30m.
The Names are seeking to prove that Lloyd's owes Names a duty of care, and
that in failing to supervise the Oakeley Vaughan agency properly, Lloyd's
was at least partially responsible for the loss.
Mr Lyndon-Stanford said that during 1980 and 1981 the authorities at Lloyd's
received information indicating that the Oakeley syndicates were guilty of
'overwriting' - accepting more premiums than allowed according to Lloyd's
rules - and also, along with Oakeley's sister broking company, breaching
other market regulations.
Following subsequent internal investigations, Lloyd's had taken disciplinary
measures against a number of insurers linked to the Oakeley Vaughan agency.
The Names say Lloyd's had not ensured that Names were informed of the
problems. 'Names therefore continued to back Oakeley Vaughan syndicates in
ignorance of its real position,' said Mr Lyndon-Stanford.

FT  23 APR 91 / Discrimination decline is seen in Ulster employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland's new fair-employment laws are beginning to reduce
religious discrimination in the workplace, Mr Bob Cooper, chairman of the
province's Fair Employment Commission, said yesterday.
Mr Cooper's comments followed publication of the commission's first broad
religious profile of the Ulster workforce, based on information from all
public and private-sector companies employing more than 25 workers. The data
cover almost 350,000 people - about two thirds of the province's workforce.
The breakdown showed that 61 per cent of those employed were Protestant and
33 per cent Roman Catholic. A further 6 per cent were described by the
commission as 'non-determined'. The commission estimates the total working
population to be about 62 per cent Protestant and 38 per cent Roman
Catholic.
Although the figures generally suggest the numbers of Roman Catholics in
jobs are almost in line with those available for work, the small percentage
variation has a significant difference on unemployment rates.
Male Roman Catholics remain twice as likely as Protestants to be unemployed
with under-representation and are particularly under-represented in senior
positions. Roman Catholics are also under-represented in the public sector,
where their they are reluctant to apply for jobs with the security forces.

FT  23 APR 91 / FT Law Report: British Gas employees to get inequality
compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER AND OTHERS v BRITISH GAS PLC House of Lords (Lord Keith, Lord
Templeman, Lord Ackner and Lord Jauncey): April 18 1991
BRITISH GAS is a state controlled statutory body with special monopoly
powers for the provision of public services and accordingly, though it is a
commercial enterprise, its employees, like public sector employees, can rely
directly on the European Community equal treatment Directive when
complaining of a discriminatory retirement policy operating before UK
enactment of equality legislation.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by Mrs M Foster and five
other female employees of British Gas plc (formerly the British Gas
Corporation), from a Court of Appeal decision that they were not in a
position to seek compensation against British Gas for discrimination on
grounds of sex.
LORD TEMPLEMAN said that article 5 of the EC equal treatment Directive of
February 9 1976, provided that member states of the EC should apply the
principle of equal treatment to working conditions, so that 'men and women
shall be guaranteed the same conditions without discrimination on grounds of
sex'.
The UK took the view that the Directive did not render unlawful a rule that
men and women must retire at pensionable age, even if that meant that women
must retire at 60 whereas men need not retire before 65.
In Marshall (1986) QB 401 the European Court of Justice ruled that a general
policy of retiring women when they reached pensionable age at 60 and men
when they reached pensionable age at 65, was an infringement of the equal
treatment Directive.
The Court reiterated that a member state which had not adopted measures to
give effect to the Directive 'may not plead as against individuals, its own
failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails'.
It ruled that where a person involved in legal proceedings was able to rely
on a Directive as against the state, he might do so regardless of the
capacity in which the state was acting, whether employer or public
authority. It said, 'In either case it is necessary to prevent the state
from taking advantage of its own failure to comply with Community law.'
As a result of Marshall section 2 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, which
came into force on November 7 1987, rendered unlawful any discrimination by
any person against a woman in relation to retirement age, so that the
anomaly between employees in the public sector who could rely on the equal
treatment Directive, and employees in the private sector who could not, was
eliminated.
The position remained, however, that a woman in the public sector who was
discriminated against by retirement between February 9 1976 and November 7
1987, might be able to obtain compensation for breach of the Directive.
British Gas had a policy that women should retire at 60 and men at 65. It
infringed the Directive. The appellant employees were compulsorily retired
between December 27 1985 and July 22 1986. They claimed compensation for
unlawful discrimination.
The House of Lords referred to the European Court the question whether
British Gas was a body of such a type that the appellants were entitled to
rely directly on the Directive.
The Court gave its ruling on July 12 1990.
By paragraph 22 it said that article 5 (1) of the Directive might be relied
on in a claim for damages against 'a body whatever its legal form which has
been made responsible, pursuant to a measure adopted by the state, for
providing a public service under the control of the state and has for that
purpose special powers beyond those which result from the normal rules
applicable in relations between individuals'.
Accordingly, the question for the House was whether British Gas was such a
body.
By the 1972 Gas Act, replacing the 1965 Act and repealed by the 1986 Act,
the British Gas Corporation was established as a body corporate. The
secretary of state was authorised to make regulations with regard to the
appointment, tenure and vacation of office by Corporation members. Section 2
provided that it was the Corporation's duty to develop and maintain an
efficient and co-ordinated system of gas supply for Great Britain.
Thus British Gas was a body which was made responsible pursuant to a measure
adopted by the state, for providing a public service.
By section 4 the Corporation was directed to report to the minister, who was
authorised to give it appropriate directions for securing its efficient
management. By section 7 he was authorised to give it general directions as
to the exercise and performance of its functions in relation to matters
affecting national interest. By section 8 it was ordered to report annually
to the minister on the exercise and performance of its functions, policy and
programmes.
By section 29 of the 1972 Act, 'no person other than the Corporation shall .
. . supply gas to any premises except with the consent of the Corporation'.
That section conferred on British Gas 'special powers beyond those which
result from the normal duties applicable in relations between individuals'.
Accordingly, British Gas was a body which was made responsible pursuant to a
measure adopted by the state for providing a public service under the
control of the state and had, for that purpose, special powers beyond those
which resulted from the normal rules applicable in relations between
individuals.
British Gas could therefore not take advantage of the state's failure to
comply with the equal treatment Directive.
The appellants' complaints of unlawful discrimination were dismissed by the
industrial tribunal and the Court of Appeal on the ground that, for the
purposes of the Directive, British Gas was a private individual against whom
the Directive could not be enforced.
Before the European Court and before the House, British Gas repeated the
arguments which had found favour in the courts below. It submitted it was a
statutory corporation engaged in commercial activities; it did not perform
any of the traditional functions of the state; and it was not the agent of
the state. It argued that the European Court could not have intended to made
the Directive enforceable against a commercial concern.
Those submissions were irrelevant to the tests laid down in the Court's
ruling.
The sole question were whether British Gas, pursuant to a measure adopted by
the state, provided a public service under the control of the state, and
exercised special powers.
British Gas submitted that the secretary of state did not possess the
control contemplated by the Court because it had wide powers in the
performance of its functions. It submitted that monopoly in the supply of
gas was not a 'special power' contemplated by the Court, and that the Court
in its ruling had not clearly provided that nationalised industries carrying
out commercial functions were to be regarded as organs of the state.
The principle laid down by the European Court was that the state must not be
allowed to take advantage of its own failure to comply with EC law.
British Gas's policy was no doubt thought to be in its commercial interests.
The advantages of that policy would accrue indirectly to the state which
provided, through British Gas, a supply of gas for citizens generally and
was entitled to surplus revenue. If British Gas were allowed to escape the
consequences of an admitted breach of the Directive, the state would be
taking advantage of its own failure to comply with EC law.
In those circumstances there was no justification for a narrow or strained
construction of the Court's ruling.
Applying the words of the ruling, the 1972 Act created a body which provided
a public service to citizens generally under the control of the state, which
could dictate its policies and retain its surplus revenue. British Gas had a
special monopoly power created by the legislature. It was therefore a body
against which the Directive might be enforced.
The appeal was allowed. The proceedings were restored to the industrial
tribunal to assess compensation.
Their Lordships agreed.
For the appellant employees: James Goudie QC and John Cavanagh (Bruce Piper
&amp; Co).
For British Gas: Michael Beloff QC and Elizabeth Slade (CEH Twiss, British
Gas solicitor).

FT  23 APR 91 / Second bidder likely to pull out of ECGD sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND company is likely to pull out of the bidding for the short-term
credit insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department.
Management of Cobac, the private sector Belgian credit insurance company, is
to recommend to its board this week that it pulls out. The decision will
embarrass the government as it will weaken the field further, just as the
controversial privatisation legislation is scheduled to come before the
House of Lords.
Eagle Star was the first of the six shortlisted bidders to withdraw and
another, Sun Alliance, is still considering whether to submit a bid by the
April 30 deadline.
Mr Jason Hadick, Cobac managing director, said that the move reflected
doubts about the availability of re-insurance cover for credits to
politically risky developing countries. Whitehall policy on this meant that
British exporters 'would be at a structural disadvantage to their
competitors'.
He added he was 'extremely disappointed' by the move earlier this month by
Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, to overthrow an amendment to the
privatisation bill which would have required Whitehall to provide political
risk re-insurance cover for three years after the privatisation.
Without such cover from the government, the newly-privatised ECGD would
either have to charge very high premiums or sacrifice its rate of return, he
said.
Export credit bankers say they expect the bidding to end in a battle between
NCM, the Dutch credit insurer, and Trade Indemnity, which dominates the UK
domestic credit insurance market. They believe NCM has the edge at present,
although Italy's Assicurazioni Generali is understood to have made a
forceful sales pitch to ECGD management.
Cobac's move comes as major exporters, including Trafalgar House and GEC,
are mounting a fresh but discreet campaign to prevent what they see as a
concerted effort by the Treasury to withdraw government support for exports
to developing countries, including those sold under long-term credit.
The business of insuring such credits will remain a government
responsibility even after the privatisation of ECGD's short-term business.

FT  23 APR 91 / SIB may trigger investment industry shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHAKE-UP of investor-protection organisations and of investment
intermediaries may result from a review of investment-product retailing
initiated by the Securities and Investments Board, writes Barry Riley.
SIB, the chief investment watchdog, yesterday announced that it would work
with the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers' Regulatory
Association (Fimbra), the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory
Organisation (Lautro) and other organisations to produce a formal
consultative document by the autumn.
The investigation of the working of existing rules - which split
intermediaries rigidly into independent financial advisers (IFAs) on the one
hand and company salesmen or tied agents on the other - has been triggered
partly by the mass switch by almost all leading banks and building societies
from independent to tied status within the past three years.
SIB has been disappointed by results of public opinion surveys that suggest
that the public does not understand or care about the differences between
IFAs and company salesmen.
Also, serious difficulties have been encountered by Fimbra, which oversees
IFAs.
Membership has been falling sharply, leading to financial problems that have
been worsened by the burden of the investors' compensation scheme.
SIB has already been requested by the Department of Trade and Industry to
investigate disclosure of commissions and other details to investors,
following a report by the Office of Fair Trading. IFAs complain that they
must disclose much more than company salesmen.
As part of its formal review of retail regulation, SIB is inviting
submissions from interested parties such as investors' representatives,
although it says it wants to discuss the overall framework rather than
address individual points of grievance.

PAKISTAN yesterday announced more steps in its programme of economic
liberalisation aimed at scrapping government controls and launching a drive
towards privatisation, Farhan Bokhari reports from Islamabad.
Mr Shujaat Hussain, industries minister, said foreign businessmen no longer
needed to seek permits to work in Pakistan. They would only need an ordinary
visa.
Mr Malik Naeem, commerce minister, announced a new export policy, with fresh
incentives for Pakistani businessmen. To boost exports, the government would
provide two-thirds of the cost of setting up new institutions for improving
workers' training, if business associations paid the rest.
A new export-import bank providing specialised help for Pakistani exporters
was announced. A marketing promotion programme would begin soon to train
trade attaches serving abroad.
Officials say the government intends to sell off at least one-third of
Pakistan's 150-strong public-sector units by the end of this year. The
exports drive is aimed at ending Pakistan's Dollars 2bn annual trade
deficit.

MILLIONS of Americans celebrated Earth Day yesterday amid concern about
political stalemate over environmental legislation.
Two controversial laws are due for renewal this year: the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, the federal law governing disposal and
management of hazardous wastes, and the Clean Air Act. Environmentalists say
the outlook for both is dim, thanks to lack of leadership by the White House
and in Congress.
Mr Jim Middaugh, spokesman for the Environmental Defence Fund, said bills to
renew and strengthen both acts were plagued more by regional disagreement
than by partisan differences. In the case of the waste disposal legislation,
those states with large tracts of surplus land were concerned about becoming
dumping sites for those with little free land and high populations.
No consensus has emerged about incineration methods. 'Do you incinerate or
do you prevent production?' Mr Middaugh said. 'Some want recycling, some
want wastes burned as fuels, some want that prohibited. Environmentalists
generally want to see a reduction in the process of materials that create
hazardous wastes.'
On the Clean Water Act, there are disputes between those who want to develop
stricter standards and those municipalities desperately in needs of federal
funds to meet current standards. Growth plans of some cities are being
limited by disputes over sewage treatment.
Little progress is also expected on energy conservation measures, despite a
study published by the National Academy of Sciences this month demanding
action to combat the 'greenhouse effect'.
The academy's recommendations included: tax incentives or regulation to
achieve a 30 per cent increase in car fuel efficiency; use of new
fluorescent bulbs to reduce the power used in lighting by 50 per cent; more
efficient motors to reduce industrial energy demand; tougher standards for
appliances; and a restructuring of energy prices to reflect their costs to
the environment.
The administration responded by restating its opposition to energy taxes and
to more stringent federal efficiency standards.

FT  23 APR 91 / Farm deal upsets Falklanders: Is the unloved FIC being paid
too much? John Barham reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Falkland Islands government announced on April 6 that it planned to
buy out the last big absentee landowner left on the islands, it probably
expected the deal to be received as a triumph of local power over the
unloved Falkland Islands Company (FIC).
However, opposition to the sale quickly began to grow as purchase terms for
the four FIC farms emerged. Less than a week after the announcement, a straw
poll by the local radio station found that 36 of the 50 people questioned
rejected the deal.
The government has agreed to pay Pounds 4.85m for the farms, which cover
974,000 acres of prime land in the southern half of East Falkland. Other
payments raise the net price to Pounds 5m, or 13 per cent of government
revenues.
Most critics focus on the price FIC won for the farms. Mr Bill Luxton, a
councillor who bitterly opposes the acquisition, said: 'It's not the concept
that is wrong. I'm all for getting the land out of the hands of FIC.' But he
argues that the farms and their 200,000 sheep have been grossly overvalued,
claiming that the Falklands have handed Anglo United, FIC's troubled parent
company, a Pounds 3m 'donation'.
Mr Gerard Robson, one of the councillors who negotiated with Anglo, conceded
that 'with the present state of wool prices you can't argue that this is a
brilliant deal.'
The farms' only significant product is wool. Wool prices have crashed to a
50-year low and no farmer is making money. So the Falklands should have
received a discount from FIC instead of paying a premium.
However, FIC says it had another potential buyer who had offered as much as
Pounds 6m for the farms.
Officials admit that covering losses at the farms, which produced 29 per
cent of last year's wool output of 2,591 tonnes, will raise the acquisition
price to Pounds 8m over the next three years. Mr Derek Howatt, chief
financial officer, says the purchase may push the government into an
operating deficit this year.
Still, the legislative council is unlikely to reject the sale. Mr Robson,
like most councillors, says it is worth paying a premium to wrest control of
the islands' economy from FIC, which, established by royal charter in 1852,
wielded almost feudal powers in the Falklands until the 1970s.
Naturally, many people are questioning the wisdom of making the government a
big landowner at a time when state economic intervention is being rolled
back all over the world. However, Mr Ronald Sampson, the government chief
executive, says: 'We will take a very hard commercial line in running the
business. But we will not announce redundancies in the medium term. If (the
farms) have no long term future they will be allowed to go to the wall.'
The government can also be criticised for failing to loosen FIC's grip over
the islands' economy. Its shipping, retail and service operations remain
intact. These sectors are probably the most lucrative part of FIC's
operation.
Although Anglo United refused a government offer to buy FIC outright, it
decided to give the government 'for no consideration' a half-share in its
subsidiary Darwin Shipping. Darwin is a charter company that handles nearly
all the islands' foreign trade. By making the government a partner, FIC
probably expects it will be less anxious to break its oligopoly.
Strangely, the sale has highlighted the islanders' lack of self-confidence.
The Falklands remain very much a colony with appointed officials such as Mr
Sampson running local government. All big decisions must first be approved
in London, sometimes at cabinet level.
British officials say in private that the islanders often fail to grasp
complex issues, such as the land deal, fully. For their part, islanders fear
that the British government subordinates their interests to its own
political aims.
Conspiracy theorists suspect that obscure geopolitical or vested interests
were the 'real' reason behind the land sale. They say the government was
suspiciously quick to accept a sale that may not be in the islands' best
interests.
The Falklands have grown rich quickly through the sale of fishing licences.
This year licences will raise Pounds 23.7m for the treasury. The government
had earlier convinced the islanders to save as much of the windfall as
possible. But now it has agreed to a deal that will cost this year's budget
surplus.
Mr Ray Evans, a farmer, says: 'If they could only give a solid reason for
paying such a high price, it would calm a lot of people.'
But Mr Rodney Lee, once a farm hand and now the owner of a successful sheep
farm, summarises the islanders' dilemma: 'I've done a lot of bowing and
scraping in my time. We have been dictated to all our lives. All that ended
after the (1982 Argentine) invasion. But we don't have many local people who
are qualified to take complex decisions.'

THE US General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has
begun an inquiry into the dozens of trips taken by Mr John Sununu, the White
House chief of staff, using military aircraft for what may have been
personal and political purposes.
The investigation was requested by Congressman John Conyers, chairman of the
House government operations committee. The Michigan Democrat lost no time in
pouncing on the opportunity to discredit Mr Sununu, who is heartily disliked
by many congressional Democrats.
An account of Mr Sununu's trips was given in the Sunday editions of the
Washington Post and US News and World Report magazine. The Post said Mr
Sununu had taken more than 60 trips in the past two years which included
visits to New Hampshire, his home state, and to Colorado ski resorts.
Mr Sununu reimbursed the government for the trips at the rate it would have
cost him to fly commercially. However, his use of military aircraft costs
thousands of dollars more.
On one trip, to Aspen, Colorado, he reimbursed the government Dollars 1,076
(Pounds 601). However, according to the Post, the cost to the Air Force was
more than Dollars 30,000.
Administration officials rushed to Mr Sununu's defence, portraying the use
of military aircraft as necessary so that the chief of staff could maintain
constant communications with the president.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S National Assembly yesterday rapidly finished revising the
constitution to end a state of war with China that has lasted for 43 years -
in the absence of opposition and independent delegates who walked out in
protest.
Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist Chinese government suspended the constitution
with additional emergency clauses, and declared a 'Period of Communist
Rebellion' just before it was driven to Taiwan by Mao's Communist forces in
1949.
The removal of the clauses allows President Lee Teng-hui to end the period
of 'Communist Rebellion' in early May and usher in a new era of
constitutional democracy for Taiwan.
Taipei hopes it also signals the start of a new relationship with the
communists in Peking, from whom it is expecting a positive response. Both
governments still staunchly claim sovereignty over all of China including
Taiwan, but a rapprochement of some sort has been forced upon them by
growing interchange between their peoples in recent years.
The opposition Democratic Progressive party and a number of other groups
oppose the National Assembly's adoption of a constitutional reform package
that allows the president to keep emergency powers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIGHTS may be on again in Kuwait City, but not, it seems, for the
fledgling opposition parties.
Their attempt yesterday to hold a press conference to comment on the
composition of the new government, just hours before the visit of Mr James
Baker, US secretary of state, left everyone literally in the dark as the
plug was pulled on the lighting system of the ballroom at the International
Hotel.
'Things are really going to get hot here now. We can already see what this
new government is going to be like,' said one opposition leader as his
colleagues, journalists, television crews, the hotel management - and the
wife of a US senator, dressed in medical garb - milled in confusion around
the ballroom. The seven main opposition groups had called their press
conference for 10am.
The management of the hotel then claimed that no booking had been made,
therefore no press conference could be held.
On to the scene came Mrs Cindy McCain, whose every second sentence reminded
the listener that her husband is Senator John McCain (Republican, Arizona).
Senator McCain's political career has, apparently, not been prospering of
late.
Mrs McCain was also due to give a press conference in the ballroom about the
work of her American Voluntary Medical Team, which she founded five years
ago and which explained her attire. Sadly for Mrs McCain, who travels with
her own television team, she failed to grasp the attention of the audience,
and, after a few minutes, offered to donate the rest of her allotted time to
the gentlemen from the opposition.
At this point, the hotel management had to come clean. There was not going
to be an opposition press conference in the hotel now, or perhaps at any
time. To emphasise the point, the ballroom was plunged into darkness.
Questions about the origin of the order met no response.
'It's obvious what is behind this,' said Dr Sami al-Katrash, an economist
from the University of Kuwait, carefully avoiding greater precision. Mr
Mohammed al-Kabiri, a former ambassador who in the last eight months had the
unusual distinction of being jailed in Kuwait by both his own government and
Iraq, was less cautious.
As the press conference informally reassembled in the open air, Mr al-Kabiri
said the newly constituted government was not representative of anyone. The
occupation and liberation of Kuwait had changed nothing, he asserted, except
that the opposition was now stronger and was determined to see the
introduction of democracy, especially freedom of speech.

FT  23 APR 91 / Hong Kong stumbles badly in its battle of wills with China:
Peking is out-manoeuvring colonial officials over the contentious issue of
who will control a proposed Pounds 7bn airport, reports John Elliott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG is losing on points in a tense diplomatic battle with China over
plans to build a HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7bn) international airport, which
Peking is refusing to back until it has achieved extensive control over the
project.
The British colony is not prepared to concede such control before it returns
to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and it is threatening to shelve the project
indefinitely. This is creating uncertainty which is knocking business
confidence - yesterday the local stock market plummeted by 2.32 per cent,
the biggest fall since the start of the Gulf conflict last August.
Hong Kong's colonial government has also lost points recently to China on
three other occasions while trying to defend its constitutional rights.
The latest occurred yesterday when Mr Gordon Wu, a prominent construction
entrepreneur, was invited to Peking for talks on plans drawn up by a group
of Hong Kong Chinese property developers to take over the project and
finance it themselves for about HKDollars 60bn.
Mr Wu's ace card would be to suggest to China that he and the other
developers could build the airport rapidly after 1997 if Hong Kong refuses
to come to terms in the next few weeks. Infuriated Hong Kong government
officials see this as a spoiling tactic at a time when they are trying to
persuade China to come to terms.
Another loss on points came last week after Hong Kong refused to publicise
details of its options for the project, despite considerable local pressure.
Top Peking officials provocatively said that they were willing to publish
their ideas as soon as Hong Kong agreed, so that local people could judge
which alternative they prefer. This led to an outspoken debate in the
colony's Legislative Council last Wednesday when legislators turned on
Britain and Hong Kong, not China.
But perhaps most humiliating of all was a lecture read to Hong Kong
officials recently by China about fiscal discipline, control of public
borrowings, and maintenance of fiscal reserves. This was not a new line,
because China has been arguing that the airport project will drain reserves
and weaken the economy before 1997.
The humiliation arose because the Chinese, who are not themselves renowned
for strong fiscal discipline, read the lecture from Hong Kong's 1979 budget
speech delivered by Sir Philip Haddon-Cave, the then powerful financial
secretary. The inference was that, in order to build a massive British
memorial to over 150 years of colonial rule, Hong Kong's current top
officials had over-ridden the strict financial ethics on which the colony
had thrived.
China acknowledges a new airport is needed to replace existing congested
facilities. But it has been objecting to the plans since late 1989,
initially for a mixture of political and economic reasons. Now it is seeking
a continuing say on the project - for example the right to examine financial
borrowing and contract decisions - in addition to having seats on an airport
authority board. 'It wants control,' says a senior official.
Hong Kong says it is only prepared to consult China. It argues that any
further consensus-seeking measures would slow the project and establish a
precedent for China to gain virtual control of other medium- and long-term
economic and fiscal decisions before 1997.
Hong Kong's aim now is to persuade China that it is not bluffing when it
says that it would prefer to shelve (or effectively cancel) the project and
expand its existing Kai Tak airport. This refusal to give Peking a precedent
for control is backed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, who
failed to reach agreement during a recent visit to Peking and who would have
to sanction any final breakdown with the Chinese.
The airport is now estimated to cost HKDollars 100bn at 1990 prices and is
the world's largest new infrastructure project apart from Gulf
reconstruction.
Officials had hoped the private sector would finance 40 to 60 per cent of
the HKDollars 127bn plans (at 1988 prices) originally announced in 1989,
which included linked port developments to be carried out later.
Recently it has emerged that the expected private sector element has dropped
to only about 25 per cent of the HKDollars 100bn - including bonds, loans,
equity stakes and franchises for parts of the airport.
But whatever the percentage, the government now believes that China's
support is essential. It fears China would attack the project if there were
no agreement and that this would scare off financial backers because
franchise periods and debt repayments would not start before 1997.
It might even deter six pre-qualified international construction consortia
which are now waiting to be invited to submit tenders for the Lantau Fixed
Link. Business confidence, on which Hong Kong depends, would slump.
Politics apart, Hong Kong could build the airport without the private
sector. It has HKDollars 75bn of basic fiscal reserves, plus an Exchange
Fund which has a secret amount of accumulated investment earnings, believed
to be about HKDollars 50bn-70bn (in addition to HKDollars 40bn needed to
prop up the currency and about HKDollars 60bn transferred temporarily as
investments from the fiscal reserves).
Most of the Exchange Fund earnings could be used for the airport, but the
government does not regard this as a viable option because it would be
strenuously opposed by China and, possibly, by Hong Kong people.
So the future of the project before 1997 depends on agreement with China.
This is a dramatic turnround from two years ago, when Hong Kong saw no need
even to consult Peking fully on the plans. As late as last year top
officials were saying they would go ahead on their own if China did not fall
into line, using public sources for the bulk of the funds.
Hong Kong is learning painfully about China's determination to protect its
inheritence over the final six years of British rule.

FT  23 APR 91 / Saddam seeks policy to partner brute force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAMIS ANDONI

<DATELINE>
   IRAQ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Iraqi government's decision to launch negotiations with Kurdish
opposition leaders is the latest sign that President Saddam Hussein is
attempting to remain in power by means of political flexibility as well as
brute force.
It might be going too far to suggest that President Saddam, who has just
deployed his security forces to crush Kurdish and Shia Moslem rebellions in
the north and south of the country, is in a conciliatory mood.
But the Ba'athist leadership, weakened by the allies' crushing victory over
the Iraqi army in Kuwait, is desperate to secure popular support by
implementing - or appearing to implement - a programme of liberalisation. It
is almost as if Mr Saddam has been studying recent events in the former
communist dictatorships of eastern Europe; he is trying to tinker with the
old system without allowing it to collapse.
Even those Iraqis who supported the government are now aware that three
decades of Ba'athist rule has suppressed rather than resolved the sectarian
and ethnic problems of Iraq. The appointment of Mr Saadoun Hammadi, a Shia
Moslem, to the post of prime minister (previously occupied by Mr Saddam) is
one of the most visible signs of the new mood in Baghdad.
For the first time someone other than the president has been allowed to
assume a high profile, with Mr Hammadi addressing the people and announcing
plans for political reform and economic liberalisation. Iraqis, however,
believe this is partly to deflect domestic and international attention from
the unprepossessing personality of Mr Saddam until the pressure eases. With
the president portrayed for the time being as a symbolic figure, any policy
disasters can be laid at the door of Mr Hammadi.
Iraqi newspapers, closely controlled by the state, are even allowed to
criticise Mr Hammadi and for the first time in recent memory cartoons of a
senior official have appeared in the newspapers. Al-Qadisiya, the Defence
Ministry newspaper, led the way with a half-page of satire in which
cartoonists reminded Mr Hammadi of the shortcomings of the system.
Ordinary Iraqis, even some Ba'athists, remain very sceptical about the
ability of the regime to change. Post-defeat calls for radical reform have
been replaced by a sense of helplessness and despair.
From the Kurdish north to the predominantly Shia Moslem south people feel
that they have no control over their own lives after the destruction of much
of their infrastructure by the allies and the crushing of the internal
uprisings across the country.
Those Kurds trickling back to their homes in Kirkuk and Suleimaniya do not
hide their sympathy for the opposition or their fear of the government.
Journalists who went on government-organised trips to the holy Shia cities
of Najaf and Kerbala in the south were confronted by the defiant stares of
local men and women. Damage in the south is much more serious than in the
Kurdish north.
Even in Baghdad there are indications that the army's suppression of the
rebellion has provoked militant feelings among Shia intellectuals.
The prospect of anarchy in a fragmented Iraq and the unconvincing political
performance of the multi-party Iraqi opposition has done something - in
Baghdad at least - to persuade people to give the government's much-heralded
reforms a chance to work.
Kurdish leaders themselves are reluctantly talking to the government despite
what they regard as previous betrayals, although they are insisting on
international guarantees for any autonomy plan accepted by the regime.
Many Iraqis, however, fear that President Saddam will backtrack as soon as
he feels that his grip on the country is secure.
He has pledged in a number of speeches that the process of reform is
irreversible, but Iraqis say he has a long way to go before they will take
him at his word.

FT  23 APR 91 / S Korea's industry giants pick their core businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF South Korea's largest chaebol, the highly diversified conglomerates
which dominate the country's economy, have selected the three subsidiaries
which they will develop as core businesses under a government plan to
increase industrial specialisation and international competitiveness.
In submissions to the Office of Bank Supervision and Exchange - the
government banking watchdog - which were released yesterday, all but six of
the conglomerates nominated their three 'core' business groups. The selected
subsidiaries will be freed from restrictions on bank lending which were
imposed on the chaebol in 1984 and which were aimed at limiting economic
concentration.
The six which have not yet selected core businesses have had the deadline
extended from last weekend until the end of this month.
The selections have raised concerns about overlapping investments and fierce
competition in several industrial sectors. Many of the chaebol have chosen
subsidiaries from the same industries for specialisation. Twelve of the 30
conglomerates, for example, have selected petrochemicals. Cars and
electronics were also common choices.
The new policy, which will be implemented from June 1, is intended to
increase specialisation among Korea's business giants by providing credit
incentives to concentrate on a smaller number of activities. The government
argues that more focused investment in technology and productivity is needed
to increase Korean competitiveness in international markets.
Chaebol subsidiary companies other than the three selected will see existing
credit controls tightened. The Ministry of Finance said the government was
deciding how to apply the squeeze.
While the chaebol oppose the existing policy of credit constraints, they
have strongly criticised the government's moves to make them specialise. A
statement by the Federation of Korean Industry, which represents the large
business groups, compared the new policy to a lottery.
Most industry observers believe it will be difficult for the government to
enforce the policy and, in particular,to prevent funds flowing from selected
group companies to other subsidiaries.
There were few surprises in the subsidiaries selected by the various
companies. Samsung Group, the largest of the conglomerates, which last year
recorded sales of Dollars 43.4bn (Pounds 24.2bn), selected Samsung
Electronics, Samsung Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries and Samsung General
Chemical as its core businesses.
Hyundai Group, the second biggest conglomerate, and Lucky Goldstar, the
third biggest, also selected petrochemicals as one of their choices. Daewoo
Group, the fourth largest chaebol, did not select Daewoo Motors, its 50-50
joint venture with General Motors of the US. But it did select Daewoo
Shipbuilding and Heavy machinery, which will soon start to manufacture
mini-cars.
As well as free access to bank credit, the companies chosen will have
restrictions on real estate purchases lifted.

<TEXT>
HUNGARY yesterday attacked a Slovak plan to divert the Danube river,
accusing it of breaking international law, after talks about the
controversial hydro-electric project broke up in disagreement, writes
Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
Slovakia appeared determined to continue with the Bos-Nagymaros project,
despite Hungary's opposition. Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovakian Prime
Minister, even made a veiled threat to complete construction within
Slovakia's own territory, according to Hungarian officials.
'It would infringe the integrity of Hungarian territory,' an official said
of a Slovak scheme to divert the Danube.
Mr Meciar refused to rule it out as one way of circumventing Hungarian
opposition. 'Slovakia will not give up its intention to continue
construction,' he said. Digging a new channel was one of nine possibilities
being considered.
Hungarian public opinion is so concerned about the environmental
consequences of Bos-Nagymaros that the issue was at the centre of opposition
to the country's former Communist regime. Slovakia, on the other hand, has
done 90 per cent of the work on its side of the river.

THE enfant terrible of the French Socialist Party, Mr Jean-Pierre
Chevenement, who resigned earlier this year as defence minister in protest
against the Gulf war, is planning a come-back to national politics and shows
every sign of intending to live up to his reputation.
Yesterday he announced that he would be standing for parliament again, in a
by-election in his old Belfort constituency, which is being voluntarily
vacated by one of his loyal followers, Mrs Gilberte Marin-Moskovitz.
Under the French system, a politician who becomes a minister automatically
surrenders his parliamentary seat, and it is then filled by the next person
on his electoral list. Only the generosity of his successor, as in this
case, allows him a chance of recapturing it.
Despite Mr Chevenement's resistance to official policy during the Gulf
crisis, the Socialist party spokesman yesterday said that it would support
his campaign.

INDUSTRIAL production in Yugoslavia fell just over 23 per cent last month
compared with a year earlier.
Croatia, the independence-minded western republic, was hardest hit ; its
output fell by 29 per cent. The three-month figure for the predominantly
ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo was 31.2 per cent below that for the same
period last year.
The republics of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia are all resisting the market
reforms proposed by Mr Ante Markovic, the prime minister. These reforms call
for the total overhaul of the country's financial and banking system and
introduction of a restrictive monetary policy. The programme aims to break
the hold over the economy of local political authorities.
Mr Markovic criticised the republics sharply last week for sabotaging his
plans and he appealed to the federal parliament to back the reforms in the
'transitional period' while the country's leaders sought a resolution to the
political crisis. He said Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn in loans from the
International Monetary Fund and western banks depended on the republics'
compliance with the programme.
Yugoslavia's foreign debt totals Dollars 16.1bn and its trade deficit is
more than Dollars 4.5bn.
In his address to parliament, Mr Markovic announced a 30 per cent
devaluation of the dinar. He also outlined plans for restructuring the
banking system and the privatisation of state enterprises which the
governments of the republics have brought to a standstill.
Mr Markovic this week faces a battle in parliament for the approval of his
economic reforms.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUNDAY'S Social Democrat victory in a key German state election, giving the
party control of the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, is certain to
strengthen the trend towards co-operation between government and opposition.
For the first since the process of German re-unification began it has also
placed a question-mark over the future of Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself.
Mr Kohl admitted yesterday that the loss of Rhineland-Palatinate, his home
state, was a 'bitter defeat' but said that his government could not duck
unpopular decisions. He added the Social Democrats would now enjoy 'a new
dimension of responsibility' but stressed there would be no strategy change
in Bonn and that he was not considering early retirement.
Mr Kohl, echoed by other leading members of the ruling Christian Democratic
party, did say, however, that the generation change at the top of the party
had to be speeded up. Mr Theo Waigel, head of the CDU's sister party, the
Christian Social Union, called the result a 'disaster'.
Mrs Anke Fuchs, SPD general secretary, said that Mr Kohl was politically
exhausted and had sunk to the level of unpopularity of 1989 before being
saved by German unity 'which he manipulated for electoral ends'.
However, despite the boost to the SPD, the party has still to find a
convincing leadership team, and as it gets drawn into accepting more
responsibility for national politics will find it more difficult to score
points at Bonn's expense. In national opinion polls the centre-right
coalition continues to comfortably lead the SPD.
In the Rhineland-Palatinate itself the SPD will negotiate first with the
liberal Free Democrats, also coalition partners in Bonn, but may following
Hesse and Lower Saxony with a 'red-green' coalition.
In Bonn the SPD will use its blocking power in the Bundesrat to stop the
coalition's plans to abolish two local taxes mainly levied on companies.

MR VLADIMIR MECIAR, Slovakia's controversial prime minister, could lose his
job after forming a break-away populist political movement.
His Public Against Violence (PAV) party and the Christian Democratic
Movement (CDM) are now negotiating to form a new coalition government in
Bratislava, the Slovak capital. Mr Jan Carnogursky, CDM's leader and
currently deputy prime minister, is widely favoured to succeed Mr Meciar.
Earlier this month, the volatile Mr Meciar antagonised his party's
leadership by forming a rival wing called PAV-Platform for Democratic
Slovakia. He also aroused suspicion in the federal capital, Prague, by
holding talks in Moscow with the Soviet military about resuming arms
production at workless Slovak weapons factories.
He is now expected to split formally with PAV at its congress later this
month and set up a new party. While Mr Meciar is mistrusted by leaders of
the PAV, whose ratings have plummeted in recent opinion polls, but is very
popular with ordinary Slovaks.
President Vaclav Havel has called for a referendum in the Slovak and Czech
Republics on the emotive issue of independence for the former. Parliament is
expected to adopt the proposal shortly and the referendum could be held this
summer.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (33): Reaching a far wider
audience - Object Oriented Programming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE computer industry throws up new jargon with monotonous regularity and
nowhere is this more true than in the software sector.
Software developers appear to adore arcane language and have produced a
succession of intriguing, high-sounding phrases to describe the artefacts
they create.
Non-procedural programming languages, life-cycle management, user-friendly
systems and relational databases are examples from the last decade.
The start of the 1990s has seen the arrival of another: object-oriented.
Its main virtue for the marketing department is its universality. It can be
applied to virtually every facet of software. In the last couple of years
databases, languages, design methods and systems architectures have all
become object-oriented.
However, behind the awkward American-English (it should, of course, be
object-orientated), there is a serious intent.
Object-oriented design suddenly achieved a higher level of legitimacy when,
last month, the important US software company Microsoft announced its
membership of the Object Management Group (OMG), an industry group founded
to promote object-oriented standards. IBM is expected to follow and OMG can
now boast all of the prime movers in software technology as its members.
OMG was founded in 1989 by a group of companies who wanted to push the
object-oriented approach into the limelight and supervise the creation of
common standards. Membership has tripled in the last year and now numbers
over 100.
Although OMG is primarily a technical body, it will exert a crucial
influence over the design of future computer systems. The concepts of
object-oriented design reach into the heart of information technology
systems and the OMG and its members will be responsible for laying the
foundations of the new order.
That IBM and Microsoft should suddenly make their interest public at this
time is no surprise. The commercial exploitation of object-oriented design
is just beginning, with bullish predictions for growth for tools which
conform to the emerging standards.
In a report sponsored by the OMG, Ovum, the UK researcher, forecasts a
European market worth Dollars 196m this year, rising to Dollars 1.6bn by
1996. The US market is expected to be even larger with total product
revenues of more than Dollars 2bn by 1996.
Ovum's analysis is based on growth in three areas: languages and tools,
developers' tools, databases and CASE tools. 'Object technology has emerged
from the early days of religious fervour and is experiencing rapid
acceptance,' says Ovum.
Although it is a new way of looking at computer systems, object-oriented
design has its roots in the past. The approach views computer systems as a
set of objects, which can be directly related to objects in the real world.
An invoice is an object; a manufactured product is an object and they are
both represented as such within an object-oriented computer system.
Object-oriented design evolved out of the same research at Xerox Palo Alto
Research Centre (PARC) which produced the windows-icon-mouse-pointer
interface popularised on the Apple Macintosh.
Similar interfaces, such as Microsoft's Windows 3, are also available for
IBM-compatible personal computers.
The Apple Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows 3 are both described as
object-oriented interfaces and, while this is true, the object-oriented
technology goes much further than a better user interface.
Object-oriented evangelists in the software industry talk of a paradigm
shift in thinking about how computer systems can be built.
Objet-oriented design includes several important ideas which help to clarify
systems design and make better use of existing technology.
The formal definition of object-oriented systems covers useful concepts such
as inheritance and code re-use. Inheritance allows different objects to
share the same characteristics. All invoices, for example must contain an
invoice date - a characteristic which is inherited by every object called an
invoice.
The re-use of code is of more pragmatic use and can be seen in some personal
computer software. A PC equipped with Microsoft Windows 3, for example, will
use the same display-screen driver program (the software which sorts out
text and graphics) in many different applications.
Language developers are in the frontline in object-oriented technology with
Microsoft and Borland both offering language compilers which are described
as object-oriented.
Database developments have been restricted to specialist suppliers such as
Objectivity and Ontologic. But both Oracle and Ingres among others are
reported to working on the technology and will deliver products later in the
1990s.
Suppliers of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, especially
those at the technical end of the market, have been at the forefront of the
technology with US companies such as Interactive Data Environments (IDE) and
Cadre Technologies leading the way.
More important, the OMG is well on the way to formulating the first of the
standards which will allow object-oriented systems to work across different
computer systems.
The OMG published its draft architectural specification last year and has
requested tenders for the technology which will form the core of a method to
control objects and the communications between them.
Later this year it is expected to publish a formal definition of what an
object is and this is likely to spur on the tool, language and database
providers to produce object-oriented products.
Object-oriented design promises to change computer systems design beyond
recognition in the next decade. One of the advantages of the approach is
that it opens the door to computing power - what was once called programming
 -to a much wider audience.
Although complex objects, such as invoice transactions, will still need
professional expertise, less crucial processes can be engineered by users
themselves.
They will be able to combine their objects with those that already exist
within a system and produce their own customised working environments.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (32): A story of niche
markets - Expert Systems, great expectations and disappointments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN recruitment expert Mr Nigel Schollick retires in 1995, the knowledge
gained in 30 years of interviewing and recruitment will keep working.
His judgments on skills and personality, from 'tactless' to 'shy on the
phone', will be delivered on people he will never meet, through the medium
of a software product called STARS II. It is an expert system which performs
preliminary interviewing and delivers some guideline judgments to the human
interviewer.
This is a typical example of what expert systems are supposed to do -
distill the expertise of individuals and deliver them in rule-based systems.
Five years ago, there were predictions that expert systems would be a good
area for software sales, comparable with spreadsheets in the 1980s. By
drawing on the advice of expert systems, not-so-expert people would be
enabled to perform skilled tasks with the minimum of training, a process
described as de-skilling.
In fact, the expectations have been largely disappointed: some of the most
vaunted expert systems pioneers have collapsed in the shake-out of the last
couple of years.
From the Japanese, who so publicly waved the banner of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) research as a platform for government investment, very
little has emerged. Expert systems are nevertheless the most visible of all
the AI techniques to have surfaced in commerce.
Expert systems have become the domain of a few small specialised companies,
working in niche markets, rather than a recognisable market sector. However,
they have penetrated various unrelated niche markets, not by presenting any
mystique-laden breakthrough, but by integrating with software that users
know and understand.
The story of the STARS product is typical of niche usage, because it uses an
expert front-end to accepted psychometric testing techniques. The system is
for use by in-house interviewers, and has been designed to help non-experts
(rather than personnel specialists) through the first tricky and
time-consuming steps of staff interviewing.
Mr Schollick, of European Personnel Counsellors based in Buckinghamshire,
has built his interviewing skills into STARS II. His expertise is packaged
in the wording of the questions, and in the expert rules which dictate which
questions the system asks.
STARS II chooses its own path through the labyrinth of up to 300 questions
per interview, selecting the questions in the light of the previous answers.
It delivers judgments from a possible 2,000 descriptions - along with
carefully-worded suggested questions to probe sensitive areas.
These help the human interviewer prepare for the face-to-face interview that
no computer can emulate or replace. STARS supplies a consistency of decision
making, and a short cut in assessing applicants.
This is typical of the niche approach. Expert systems seem to be winning
acceptance largely as an extension of other applications, and particularly
in industries which are comfortable with advanced technology.
The best known examples come from finance and industry. One Australian bank
uses an expert system to judge credit card applications. In the UK, ICI uses
the technique to assist paint analysis. The Financial Times Business
Information report on Successful Expert Systems, published in 1989, cited 20
large UK organisations using expert systems, including a few in mainstream
areas.
Mr Tim Johnson, director of London-based research company Ovum, points to
the commercial basis which is necessary to win wide acceptance of any AI
techniques.
'A lot of systems are for diagnostics - problem tracking of some sort, or
providing consultancy, everything in fact from diagnosing medical conditions
to finding errors in the production process for gas turbines. Another
interesting usage is as a front end to access text databases, to help find
the way through the maze of what information is available,' says Mr Johnson.
Ovum's report on the European market for expert systems, Knowledge Based
Systems: Markets, Suppliers and Products, puts the total for product
revenues in expert systems at Dollars 70m in 1990 with US revenues of
Dollars 128m: excluding expenditure on consultancy and customisation.
Mr Johnson notes that the UK, once a hotbed of development, no longer
provides Ovum with ready examples of advanced technology. In part, he blames
the dissolution of the UK Alvey programme, which funded a number of AI
research projects, although there are some signs of life in the AI
community, and Ovum is about to publish a new report on Natural Language,
the first update since 1985.
'Since Alvey declined, we've had to travel to France or the US to find the
latest technology, there seem to be fewer people in the UK to talk to. The
US in particular has progressed more rapidly because US companies were quick
to adapt when they realised that the early products of research were not
quite what people wanted,' he explains.
Neuron Data, the US company Ovum cites as having the largest share of the
expert systems market in Europe, has just opened a UK direct sales operation
in London, a sign of its confidence in the future.
Neuron Data sells Nexpert Object, an expert 'shell' which puts the emphasis
on integration. This means working with existing databases, on over 30
different platforms, including Macintosh, PCs, workstations, minis, and IBM
mainframes, and with different graphical user-interfaces for ease of use.
'Expert systems are just another software technology,' says Mr Richard Stow,
Neuron Data's UK sales and marketing manager who would like to distance
expert systems from the AI tag.
'To customers it's just one technology among many others. The old world of
AI - to which Neuron Data never subscribed - was about specialist hardware,
very complex software needing esoteric programing skills, systems with
guru-level intelligence which learn from experience - no mention of
integration or portability. The old world has gone: what predominates is now
a view of expert systems from the developer's perspective,' says Mr Stow.
He divides Neuron Data users into three categories; the end users, the
providers of packaged software, and systems integrators such as Andersen
Consulting. Among notable US Nexpert users are Manufacturers Hanover Trust,
which has built a system called Inspector, for monitoring fraudulent or
high-risk deals, and computer manufacturer Tandem, which uses online expert
diagnostics for its Integrity S2 system.
Mr Stow believes the UK market is probably 12-18 months behind the US in
terms of take-up of expert system technology, but it will catch up.
Andersen Consulting has about 25 users worldwide, including four UK sites
for its Expert Configurator which is built on to the MAC-PAC manufacturing
(MRP II) package on IBM AS400s. The expert front end allows the user to
match up a specific task needing certain machines with existing tasks and
schedules.
'We'd like to think that expert systems are becoming a mainstream
technology,' concludes Mr Stow. 'In the future you might see companies
amassing knowledge-bases - with PC networks and shared information, you
might even be able to put a value on knowledge as a corporate asset.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (31): Consultants come under
software attack - Case, engineering approach fails to match expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE adoption of traditional engineering principles has helped to improve
both the quality of computer software and the process which creates it.
Software developers have turned increasingly to the disciplines of
engineering to solve the problems which have plagued computer users since
the beginnings of the industry in the 1950s.
The engineering method, first adopted by the military and academic community
in the 1970s, is universally acknowledged - if not universally applied -
throughout the computer industry.
It has spawned a large and growing market for tools, consultancy and
re-training. It has caused businesses to re-evaluate their use of
information technology and promised to change the skill needs of the
industry. Software engineering makes labour-intensive program coding
obsolete and offers greater control over the design and maintenance of
software.
In spite of significant backing from industry leaders such as IBM and DEC,
the engineering approach has not delivered its expected promise. Its
supporters face new challenges. The shift away from proprietary, monolithic
systems to multi-vendor, networked systems makes it harder to build
information technology systems and has increased the pressure on software
engineers.
Mr Richard Barker, head of Oracle Software's software engineering
operations, says this is the biggest problem facing the software industry in
the 1990s. 'The problem of designing one logical program to run across
multiple hardware platforms will occupy the next few years,' he says.
The engineering approach will play a leading role in solving the problem.
Until quite recently, software production was haphazard and mysterious. Good
results were achieved by a mixture of luck and schooled intuition.
However, in the 1980s the engineering analogy grew in credibility and
software production was increasingly seen as a craft rather than an art. It
was subject to scientific laws and the design and production of a computer
program could be defined in the same way that an engineer specifies a bridge
or a motor car.
This change coincided with increased use of computers as design aids across
industry. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) - and the workstation technology it
inspired - could be applied equally well to software design and developers
quickly discovered how to apply it to their own products.
The results were lumped together under the umbrella name of computer-aided
software engineering (Case) and packaged up for a market, eager to find ways
to build better software at low cost.
Software pioneers such as Mr James Martin went as far as to say that the
application of formal engineering methods to business systems design not
only improved the quality of software, they could also give a business edge
in the market.
The vision is yet to be fulfilled. For every moderate success, there is
equal evidence of failure.
Consultant Butler Cox noted in a report, published at the end of the 1980s,
that Case tools only worked successfully, where a formal design method -
such as Mr Martin's information engineering - had been introduced. In other
words, the principles of systems engineering must precede the use of
software engineering tools.
However, there are other reasons for the apparent slow progress.
Mr John Lowrie, who worked with Mr Martin on Information Engineering
Facility and now leads Information Architechs, puts some of the blame on
consultants: 'The consulting world took over the whole concept of Case and
it resulted in complete culture shock in user computer departments. Case
changes the skill needs - de-skilling the programming back-end job and
re-skilling the front end analysis and design.
'It is a fundamental change and means that companies need a lot of change
management - an ideal market for consultants,' says Mr Lowrie.
He sees this attitude running against real advances in the software
technology: 'Consultants are not interested in producing the best software
technology - they just want to put in armies of consultants.'
A more compelling reason for the failures of software engineering is that
the technological goalposts have moved.
Early Case tools were conceived at a time when software was built for a
single machine and operating environment - usually a large IBM mainframe or
a DEC minicomputer.
The information technology systems of the 1990s will be based on networks of
PCs, clusters of database 'servers' and high-speed transaction processing
computers.
'The current tools were based on the software technology of 1983-84. We are
now moving into second-generation products based on late-1980s technology,'
says Mr Lowrie.
He is cautious about raising expectations too soon. 'I don't think anyone
really knows the answer yet - it is very early days. Our view is that we can
evolve into other environments because in Case you are maintaining designs
not machine code. But it is few years off.'
Information Architechs, launched in autumn 1990 as a spin-off from British
Gas, says its future developments in Case are aimed at multiple-platform
applications.
'We are attracted to the idea that future systems will be based on
client/server databases and local-area networks of personal computers,' says
Mr Lowrie.
Mr John Lewis, vice-chairman of IPSYS, UK software engineering company, is
cautious and points to IBM's problems with its Systems Application
Architecture (SAA) as an example of the difficulties.
'IBM announced SAA four years ago to provide a model for bringing its three
main hardware architectures together. But its hasn't brought out much of it
yet. At the same time it has its AIX/Unix developments, which lie outside
SAA,' says Mr Lewis.
He sees Unix playing an increased role in software engineering, as a
development environment and as a platform for applications. IPSYS is working
on Case tools to support Unix alongside proprietary environments.
'It is a question of economics. If you set up IBM's AD/Cycle you need an
expensive dedicated mainframe and PS/2 for every programmer. The cost is
between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m. With Unix workstations you can set up an
equivalent system for about Pounds 1.5m and get far more power for your
money,' he says.
Oracle says it has plans to extend its Case products so they can produce
applications for multi-vendor networks. At the end of this month, Oracle
will announce a new generation of Case products which will allow designers
to specify the characteristics of the target environment and customise the
system.
This Oracle says, has implications for users. The company intends to include
more features which let the user extend the system and define new objects.
The company anticipates that within the next five years the distinction
between the development of a system and its live running will disappear.
This is a little optimistic. But there is no doubt that this is where
software engineering is heading.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (30): Systems that shed
fresh light on information - Geographic Information, 'the biggest step
forward since the map'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYND MORLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER-based geographic information systems seem set to take their place
among those developments which will embody the information age.
They are described by the government as 'the biggest step forward in the
handling of geographic information since the invention of the map'.
The systems facilitate the display and manipulation of data among such
established users as the large utilities and national and local government -
organisations that have traditionally made extensive use of paper maps - and
are increasingly recognised as an accurate and effective marketing tool by a
variety of commercial organisations.
GIS, essentially systems which allow the analysis of stored information on a
geographic basis, consist of both graphic and alphanumeric data.
Automated mapping provides pictorial representation of maps and plans using
precise numerical information, while text-based data covering any number of
factors such as cabling, sewers, parks, schools, types of housing and so
forth are combined to facilitate analysis and planning.
The main benefits of their use, according to the Chorley Committee of
Enquiry set up by the Department of the Environment in 1987 to investigate
the handling of geographic information, include fast and easy access to
large volumes of data; the ability to analyse spatial characteristics of
data and to search for particular characteristics or features in a given
area; to link or merge one data set with another; and to produce flexible
forms of output such as maps, graphs and summary statistics tailored to meet
particular needs.
Mr Glenn Carver, a GIS consultant with information management company CMG,
comments that access to data and its proper management are important
elements in the successful use of GIS.
'A well managed GIS in a local authority could, for instance, hold all the
data for the various departments, updating and distributing information to
each department as changes were made. So, a map referenced by, say, a
postcode could be called up on screen, and depending on the information
required, be marked differently.
'Thus the housing department could ask for all empty council property to be
displayed, highways for all traffic light systems, and social services for
all registered child-minders,' he says.
Such systems, however, require an enormous effort of data input, and Mr
Carver notes that from the initial decision to develop a GIS, to final
implementation, normally takes between five and eight years.
'It is a massive undertaking, you certainly can't just dip your toe into
GIS. But we are talking about the complete integration of information within
an organisation. It is vital for users to think and plan strategically, and
it is part of our job to help them do so.'
The extent of the undertaking may have slowed the progress of GIS and until
recently confined its use to governments and utilities, but the technology
is being increasingly recognised as a powerful commercial tool, enabling
companies more tightly to target groups of people as potential customers for
specific projects and services.
Retailers, such as Gateway Stores have recognised how GIS can help support
decisions about store location, while sectors such as the oil industry look
to GIS to improve transport, distribution and work scheduling decisions.
A number of systems providers and consultants are active in the market in
this country, these include McDonnell Douglas, the leading aerospace company
whose information systems division recently announced its Spatial Modelling
System, which, according to Mr Barrie Laver, who is director of the
company's Applied Graphics Group, puts paid to the long-standing gripe of
academics that GIS is merely an adjunct to computer aided design.
'Spatial database systems are distinguished by their ability to link
graphics and text, thus creating smart graphics which provide a visual
window into the administrative database,' he says.
Pinpoint Analysis, another company active in geographic information systems,
provides demographic and geographic information which, the company claims,
when combined with clients' internal information will ensure more effective
targeting and delivery of products and services.
Pinpoint is among the leading suppliers of highly detailed digital address
and road data for use in GIS and has built up a wide range of databases
including a market-specific classification system geared to the financial
services market, and a profiling system which analyses UK neighbourhoods
into marketing-oriented categories.
In keeping with the increasingly high profile of personal computers,
Pinpoint offers Geopin, a geodemographic information system which runs on a
desktop computer and was developed specifically to meet the needs of
marketers.
Mr Martin Higgings, a GIS consultant with Pinpoint, explains that the system
was designed for users who are not computing experts, but who are
increasingly aware of the relevance of geographic information systems to
their business and so require the facility to perform complex analyses with
the help of simple pull-down menus.
The PC version of Geopin can be extended into a networked system and a
compatible mainframe version is also available.
The technology for GIS is well and truly in place, but it is the data needed
to make it work which, as well as requiring a considerable time effort, may
not always be easily available.
The Chorley report noted, for example, that 'information needs to be seen as
a corporate resource and be more widely shared between departments and
organisations', adding that 'the full potential of geographic information
systems will only be secured by co-ordinating the interests of the widely
dispersed community of users.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (29): The potential of
pictures - Multi-Media, tools to create  more informative systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of 12 computer hardware and software manufacturers has put its name
to a trademark.
This is not in itself so remarkable. The establishment of a trademark does
not require any great degree of commitment. However, the object of this
collection of companies is to establish a way forward for the personal
computer industry - and that future will encompass television pictures and
sound as well as the more conventional aspects of data processing. The name
for this is multimedia, and the trademark is MPC - Multimedia Personal
Computing.
Most computer systems are constrained to store and display information in
ways more acceptable to machinery than human beings. Text or numbers are the
norm, and, where pictorial information is kept, it is most often in a form
more akin to a cartoon or drawing than to a photograph. The storage of sound
for computerised manipulation is not any more advanced.
There are exceptions to this - a good example being the Domesday Project
machines, which use a BBC micro to access all sorts of geographical and
demographic data from a video disk, for display on a television screen.
However, in the mainstream of computing such applications are rare. One of
the leading suppliers is VideoLogic, a British company. It provides a board
which can go into an IBM-compatible PC or Macintosh. It can capture
television pictures and sound for editing and inclusion in a presentation
alongside other computer data.
Integration of video, audio and conventional data within a data processing
system is known as multi-media. A multi-media system should enable the user
to manipulate and view all such data. He could, for example, press a help
button, and not only view a manual but bring up an interactive tutorial,
where a film can be seen and heard of a teacher explaining a topic of
interest.
Such manipulation should be an integral part of the system's capabilities.
In a windowed environment, this would mean that the user would see the film
in a window alongside other data, and be able to drag it around the screen
or desktop or re-size it.
If such machines were readily available, it is easy to see what their
potential would be. Wherever pictorial information was needed it could be
invoked as easily as more normal text. For example, a travel agent could
store the whole of his catalogue of holidays, and then show a customer film
of a chosen spot, with appropriate sound track, as well as the normal
textual descriptions.
Sceptics might argue that all this is more appropriate to killing martians
on a screen and certainly the games or leisure market is where much of the
development of such systems has taken place. Multi-media enthusiasts,
though, such as Mr Bill Gates of Microsoft, believe that, by the end of the
1990s, it will be the norm, and that computer users will expect to be able
to deal in all forms of data, and interact with their machines in far more
sophisticated ways than they do now.
'Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is most readily enjoyed if it is delivered in
audio form,' says Mr Gates, in a piece on the subject published in
Encyclopaedia Britannica. He has a point.
One wonders in what other form it might be delivered, apart from a printed
score. Obviously, whilst the latter might be useful to a musician, it leaves
a lot to be desired to the layman. Merely to provide
conventionally-displayed computerised information can be just as limiting
because it does not provide the user with a form of data readily interpreted
by the most appropriate human senses for the information under review.
Multi-media promises to deliver information in the most appropriate fashion,
but with the same degree of control that you experience with any other
computerised data. A company might, for example, need a system to enable
them to look at geographical data. You could start by displaying a map. From
there, the user might select a town and look at a picture of the
architecture, or at a list of companies which have offices there, and then
at pictures of their products.
Those pictures could be revolved or walked around to enable the viewer to
see them from any angle.
They could be accompanied by a spoken sound track describing what is on
view. At each stage, the correct medium would be used to communicate the
information.
It would be easy to dismiss this as just another piece of enthusiastic
marketing, a product looking for a problem. However, that would be to ignore
the way other products have blossomed, and, if not changed the world,
certainly made an impact.
Spreadsheets, for example, were originally intended merely to provide a way
of doing cash flows, to take the pain out of re-calculating when information
changed, but that in itself could not account for their phenomenal success.
Users have driven that change, and spreadsheets are now embedded within the
corporate culture to such an extent that it is hard to imagine how we could
have managed without them.
The Multi-media PC will not be an end in itself, rather it will provide the
tools necessary to create more colourful and informative systems. Doubtless
it will provide the games player with an even more realistic view of his
imaginary worlds, but it could also bring the benefits of computing to a
wider business audience than hitherto. At least, that is what the gang of 12
are banking on.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (28): Advanced technology
lifts desktop publishing systems - DTP, new software products for a maturing
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INNOVATIVE software producers are giving a lift to the maturing market for
desktop publishing systems.
Publishers of larger magazines and newspapers may once have only considered
buying, say, a dedicated newspaper production system from one of the leading
suppliers, such as Atex or Systems Integrators (SII) of the US, or N. D.
Comtec, a division of Norsk Data of Norway.
However, publications across Europe and the US are produced on Apple
Macintosh's range, for example, using standard or enhanced software packages
from Quark (X-Press) or Aldus (PageMaker), which started life as suppliers
of desktop publishing software.
These advanced software products operate on the standard DTP 'platforms,'
such as IBM's PC, the Mac or other computers that can be bought 'off the
shelf' to produce a wide range of magazines and newspapers.
The Spanish newspaper, El Sol, in Madrid is just one example of a large
circulation daily paper produced on a Mac system, using software from Quark
X-Press.
'Many of the most innovative of these newspaper and magazine software
systems are produced in the UK - they achieve great results on what,
initially, were desktop platforms,' says Ms Laurel Brunner of Seybold, the
independent information resource group for publishing technology.*
Among these new UK software systems which operate on the Mac are those from
DPS Typecraft; Talbot of Bournemouth, and QED of Cheltenham.
Meanwhile, across the DTP industry, the Dollars 1.83bn European market is
the biggest in the world, and set to continue growing as technology has
brought 500 years of graphic communications techniques to the computer
industry.
Sales of Dollars 3.9bn are forecast by 1994 - by then, there will more than
97,000 new desktop publishing installations up-and-running in Europe, with
at least 18,000 of them located in this country, according to a report from
Frost and Sullivan, the leading market research group.**
But the rate of growth is likely to slow after 1992, as software and
scanning input devices take an increasing share of sales from hardware and
new DTP systems. While most DTP software programmes are English-based,
companies such as Apple and Adobe have tackled the language problem, with
increasing sales in non-English speaking countries.
Several leading Arabic newspapers and magazines are prepared in London on
Apple Mac systems using Diwan software. They include such daily broadsheet
newspapers as Sharq al-Awsat, Al-Hayat and Sawt al-Kuwait which are produced
in London and transmitted electronically to the Middle East for printing.
Because a large proportion of software comes from the US, many packages are
English-based, and the UK is - and will remain - the largest market in
Europe for DTP installations, with sales reaching Dollars 737m in 1994.
A typical DTP system includes a personal computer, a high resolution
monitor; a 'mouse' or other hand-controlled digitiser for positioning text
and graphics; plus software for word processing, graphics and
page-composition; and a laser printer. DTP systems, which may or may not be
networked, are generally at the low end of a larger market for electronic
publishing systems.
Colour continues to be a big topic in the DTP world - as systems move on
from basic monochrome to colour, the biggest issue is how users can achieve
colour-tone consistency across various computer screens, proof printers and
presses - a facility which is especially important to advertising agencies,
for example.
Innovation abounds in all areas of the market, with higher performance PCs
and new software packages. For example, the processing speed of Postscript,
the page-description language from Adobe, has been significantly enhanced in
the past year as somputer speeds have increased.
Vendors of proprietory hardware for professional publishing systems are also
'porting' software on to the Macintosh platform.
Apple has announced a new operating system, called System 7, which give a
new environment for many applications, particularly publishing.
One of these new enhancements is called 'Publish and Subscribe' which allows
users on a DTP network to call up 'live' material, such as text, artwork or
up-to-the-minute price lists.
In the European market for DT systems, analysts expect an upsurge in demand
in a number of application areas, particularly the production of magazines,
advertising literature and public consumption information. Scanning - and
particularly the input of higher definition with greater grey-scale and
colour - is expected to push up the cost of scanners and attendant software.
Sales of core hardware, personal computers and printers in Europe could be
worth almost Dollars 1.3bn by 1994.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (27): Some severe image
problems - Computer Leasing, collapse sparks an eventful year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATISTICALLY speaking, 1990 was a dull year for the UK computer leasing
sector.
Figures released last month by the Equipment Leasing Association (ELA) show
a 4 per cent decline to Pounds 2.25bn in computer/office equipment leased by
its members, who represent more than 80 per cent of the UK leasing industry.
This is the first decline registered for at least eight years, although 1987
produced only minimal growth following exceptionally strong demand from the
financial services sector in the preceding year.
According to Mr Brian Hassell, ELA chairman, 'the decrease in 1990 reflected
the general slowing down in the economy.'
In all other respects, the last 12 months have been extraordinarily
eventful.
Starting last April with the British &amp; Commonwealth subsidiary Atlantic
Computers, a succession of independent equipment leasing companies have
collapsed or found themselves in serious difficulties.
With 1,800 employees at the time the administrators were called in, Atlantic
was once the world's third-largest computer leasing specialist.
Its customer list in 1983 included the UK Atomic Energy Authority, BAT
Industries, Hanson Trust, ICI and Penguin Books. Its 1988 turnover amounted
to Pounds 756.9m.
The most prominent of the subsequent casualties was Blackspur Leasing, the
specialist printing-press leasing company, and ICS, a diversified leasing
group whose turnover, at its peak, was approximately Pounds 70m.
In addition, the trading position of Capital Computers - another computer
leasing specialist - has deteriorated to such an extent since the end of
March 1990, according to the most recent directors' report filed at
Companies House, that it has been considering 'the sale of all or part of
its lease portfolio to third party companies and is also taking steps to
review its position in the leasing market place.'
While the increasingly recessionary business climate has undoubtedly been
partly to blame for the problems that companies have encountered, in certain
cases lax management and the questionable structure of the profferred leases
also played a role.
Atlantic pioneered an arrangement called the Flexlease which offerred
customers the ability to take advantage of advancing technology by upgrading
their computers yet which appeared - at least initially - to be extremely
attractively priced.
Unfortunately, the Flexlease concept also resulted in the accretion of
contingent liabilities due to the leasing company's commitment under certain
circumstances to make good its customer's payments over the final year or
years of the lease.
Not surprisingly, this year's collapses appear to have been the Flexlease's
death-knell.
According to Mr Geoff Sewell, director general of the European Computer
Leasing &amp; Trading Association (Eclat), 'it is very rare now that anyone
tends to look at the Flexlease, although most of the operating leases
written give customers the option of going back and renegotiating a new
deal.'
With the Department of Trade and Industry investigating Atlantic and the
fraud squad in at ICS, the collapses have also left the industry with a
severe image problem.
This can itself have serious knock-on effects.
One of the factors cited by Capital Computers for the deterioration in its
performance was 'the lack of confidence in the leasing market . . .
following the failure of the number of leasing companies trading in the UK.'
Perhaps the chief beneficiaries of the turmoil in the independent leasing
sector have been the computer manufacturers themselves, particularly IBM.
Ms Carolyn Jacks, director of Grosvenor Consultancy Services, the leasing
consultant, says the situation 'provided a marvellous opportunity for the
computer manufacturers to market their own lease offering as the safe
alternative.'
The annual European computer leasing survey commissioned by Solihull-based
Eclat underlined 'the increasing dominance of IBM's captive financing
subsidiaries.' More than 70 per cent of the survey's respondents ranked IBM
among the top three competitors in the industry, versus 16.2 per cent for
Comdisco, its nearest rival.
A year earlier, IBM had polled 54.9 per cent, versus 27.5 per cent for
Atlantic in second place.
The survey also claimed to reveal 'a rising trend of involvement by IBM' in
used equipment and buy-back transactions - a field traditionally dominated
by the independent leasing companies with their often painstakingly acquired
expertise in the market for second-hand computer equipment.
Though competition remains intense, the pressures being brought to bear on
the independents are now prompting expressions of mild concern from some
industry observers.
Mr Sewell says: 'Few people can specify five years ahead the equipment that
will meet their needs.
'The independent sector gives them the option of mixing and matching to meet
their technical requirements. Without them we would be back to the original
position at the end of the 1970s where the only alternatives available were
finance leases.'
Mr Sewell stresses, however, that 50-60 per cent of the installed computer
base is still leased through independent leasing companies.
According to Ms Jacks: 'For the manufacturers, leasing is a sales-aid method
which assists with marketing their new products - they cannot be expected to
provide their customers with the ability to change suppliers readily.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (26): Saboteurs are on the
loose - Networking, the art of knowing a Lan from a Wan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gordon Douglas is not a happy man. He manages user relations for the
European end of Netware Users International (NUI) the 80,000-strong user
group for Novell's Netware, the world's most popular networking software.
Local area networks (Lans) are on the up and up, and Netware is the code
that binds them together allowing dozens of people to share files and
peripherals such as printers. What concerns Mr Douglas is that software
saboteurs are on the loose, networks are their prime target and publishing
houses in Germany are printing their methods.
'They publish books that tell you how to plant a virus. You might as well
bring out a title on how to make an atom bomb in your living room,' says Mr
Douglas. His anger at the virus authors becomes understandable as he details
the precautions NUI and Novell have been forced to take.
'Virus attack has been the main issue in the last 12 months, and preventing
it is very expensive. A lot of leading companies do not allow employees to
use diskettes at all, so they can't unwittingly introduce a virus into a
network. The problem with networks is that they are meant to be open to many
users.'
Mr Douglas talks of protective shells, software that checks a program every
time it is entered on to the network to make sure the code has not changed.
NUI has pressured Novell to improve the security features written into
Netware. Since Netware is a computer operating system in its own right it is
not easy for the virus peddlars to get details of its workings.
Documentation is a closely guarded trade secret. But the interface between
Netware and the users' floppy disks became a focus for attention.
'Novell has now boosted protection for files entered through Netware. I
won't say exactly what they've done, NUI tested the new release by running a
virus specifically designed to attack MoveIl networks,' says Mr Douglas.
Metware's extra defences repelled the virus.
A successful virus attack can corrupt networked data across a company. 'They
can act in a nasty way. You find all your storage for the last year has
gone. Generally the motivation isn't for gain through blackmail, it's just
anarchy,' says Mr Douglas. His scorn for the unseen enemy is very real. The
other current passion the networking community admits to is economy.
'Security and money are the two big concerns at a typical user group
meeting. In the past, networking solutions had to be high-tech and
expensive. Now the emphasis is on cutting costs,' he adds. Mr Douglas reels
off the quick fixes users are resorting to. One site has found it can use
power lines as a medium for the local area network (Lan) rather than
co-axial cable.
If you don't mind the odd hiccup in non-essential data transmission this
makes some sense. 'It's daft but cheap]' is the Douglas verdict.
Mr Gary Dyson has been in a good position to observe the rise of the Lan. In
1985 he broke away from IBM with two colleagues and formed Persona Faculty.
The dual role company selling products (Persona) and training services
(Faculty) was started up to exploit networking.
In 1988, Dyson's Pounds 825 a day training courses attracted just 50 end
users. In 1990, 1,500 people signed up to get the most out of their
networks.
Two factors contributed to this growth says Mr Dyson. The political war over
the management of data, with corporate IT departments reluctant to see too
much power shipped down to the users, was resolved. The idea of a Lan of PC
workstations has been absorbed into the corporate computing model.
International standards have moved on, reconciling the IBM sponsored
Token-ring with Ethernet, a networking protocol with its roots in the
Digital Equipment world.
'The user shouldn't have to worry about choosing between them. They both
offer adequate performance, says Mr Dyson.' Faculty has ridden out the
collapse in hardware sales.
'In these times you can't sell hardware because companies have got enough.
But networking means they can turn their PC resources into a system. You
make the employees more productive. They cope better with fewer people,' he
says.
If the Lan is now an accepted standard, what are the big corporate buyers
doing to squeeze extra value out of it? As is usually the case in the
computer industry, any vaguely fresh idea is the cue for a crop of
buzzwords.
The Lan world has now spawned groupware. Referred to in the same breath as
joint authoring and discussion databases, groupware allows users to pool
documents across a network.
The secret of the software is to co-ordinate contributions without the user
being aware of this stage management. Although it is portrayed as structured
discussion it is probably better compared to the notorious bulletin boards
used to disseminate hackers' tips.
Lotus Notes is one of the pioneering groupware products. Price Waterhouse,
management consultants, use it to control activity on the international
front, when consultants work for a common client across national boundaries.
Ms Susan Challenger, an international marketing manager at Lotus, admits
that Notes may have fuelled the buzzword business.
'We're probably to blame, but groupware is a means to exploit network
software rather than just sticking a program on a network and sharing it,'
she says.
Lotus finds that network versions of popular programs now make up as much as
a third of its sales.
Ms Challenger confesses that the distinction between the Lan and its less
famous sister the wide area network (Wan) is not something to tax Lotus's
network development teams.
'When does a Lan become a Wan? I don't know. I prefer to think of everything
in Lan terms,' says Ms Challenger.
Perhaps a recent Dataquest survey offers the best explanation for the low
profile of Wans. European Lan spending is predicted to grow from Dollars
2.6bn in 1989 to Dollars 5bn by 1993. Over the same period Wan spending will
increase by a modest Dollars 100m, from Dollars 400m to Dollars 500m.
Interconnection between Lans is proving an attractive alternative to Wans
managed by expensive mainframes. And LANS are big in Japan.
The high cost of office space in Tokyo forces a rigorous assessment of every
square foot. Encouraging staff to share peripherals is one way of keeping
the rent in check, with a Lan saving precious space.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (25): Mix of cussed
independence and some mutual self interest - The User Groups, an
idiosyncrasy of the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVE MADDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEWLETT Packard has an invitation to show off its new Series 700 workstation
later this month at its user societies' annual general meeting.
However, this arrangement is not quite as cozy as it looks. Mr Steve
Chatterton, chairman of ADUS UK (the HP Apollo workstation user group) has
asked HP's main rivals IBM, DEC, Silicon Graphics and SUN, to bring their
their top workstations, and to compete in a demanding benchmark test devised
by ADUS.
HP is confident that it will not be embarrassed in its own backyard - on
paper the 700's specification is superior - but there is little doubt that
the move has ruffled HP's feathers, and it is taking the challenge seriously
 -to the extent that its worldwide workstation manager will attend.
This little drama illustrates the curious mix of cussed independence and
mutual self interest that characterises relations between user groups and
their suppliers.
The fact that user groups exist at all is testament to this ambivalence.
Fiercely protective of their separateness, yet loyal, and often genuinely
proud of their particular affiliation, in the same way that some people are
bound to their cars, user groups remain one of the idiosyncrasies of the
computer business.
At once ginger group, talking shop and social club, historically these
associations were the users' response to the technical complexities of
computing and the too often dictatorial tendencies of predominantly US-based
hardware vendors. They have developed over the last 20 years into sizeable
organisation in their own right: the IBM CUA has 1,500 members, and the DEC
group, DECUS, turns over Pounds 500,000 in the UK annually in spite of
administrative costs donated by DEC.
These national groups are invariably affiliated to larger pan-European or
international organisations or groups such as the National Computer Users
Forum (NCUF) the UK user groups' user group.
Does this complex network have anything other than a self-sustaining role?
In particular, when so many of the old loyalties and dependencies between
vendor and customer are threatened by open system environments, is their
much point in vendor specific user groups?
The short answer seems to be yes.
First, one of the primary functions of these groups is educational. 'They
act as a forum for sharing best practice. The IBM CUA serves as a
peer-to-peer information exchange both informally and through its extensive
seminar programmes. It helps us to avoid re-inventing the wheel,' says Mr
Michael Moore, CUA chairman.
DECUS's formal mission is similar exchange, both within the group, and
between the group and DEC, says Mr Steve Dawes, chairman.
As long as computing remains technically difficult, and in the short term at
least it can only get harder in a multi-vendor, open systems world, then the
user groups' basic role seems assured.
The same is true of their place as lobbyists.
This function is increasingly elevated to a formal consultative status. So,
for example, DECUS submits annual System Improvement Requests to the DEC
main board, a list of technology developments derived from polling
individual members worldwide.
At the same time, says Mr Dawes, the UK group is constantly plugging away at
local issues - anything from invoicing or licensing practice to an upgrade
path for companies using non-standard DEC hardware from the long-defunct
Systime.
Nonetheless the prospect of open environments is making its mark.
The fundamental challenge of open systems has prompted a basic restructuring
of the ICL CUA, says Mr David Stewart, its chairman.
The 35 erstwhile individual special interest groups under the CUA umbrella,
have set up a policy and review forum to consider, for the first time, their
common problems, and in particular to clarify a single voice in dealings
with ICL over open system and UNIX issues.
Mr Stewart argues that the users' voice generally has not been articulate
enough to influence open systems standards, and so far suppliers have
dominated the debate. He thinks that ICL will be delighted by the CUA's
initiative to define its own coherent set of priorities.
Similarly, Mr Moore and Mr Dawes report that open systems issues are
beginning to preoccupy their respective groups. Yet, paradoxically, they
also comment that IBM and DEC have never been more attentive in their
dealings with their users.
'IBM is relying more and more on user organisations,' says Mr Moore. Witness
the 50 senior IBM technical staff who attended the CUA's Common Europe
Conference in Brighton this month, just to listen to users, he comments.
So what is going on?
Could it be, the argument goes, that far from undermining these user groups,
open system, multi-vendor environments, could actually stimulate them?
User groups are persuaded that, as customers become more transient, then
suppliers will appreciate just how critical they are in marshalling customer
opinion, and ultimately, in keeping their loyalty.
Does this work out?
In part, perhaps. Certainly the days of user coercion are long gone. Mr
Richard Owen, HP's workstation marketing manager, who will have to face the
ADUS challenge, remarks that HP has long been a customer-led company. 'ADUS
is one place we can listen to them,' he says.
However, the rub, Mr Owen argues, is that whilst user groups are peopled by
technologists - MIS managers and systems administrators - then they will not
drive IT strategy, and in the long term, it is that, rather than the
practical consequences of open computing, that will marginalise them.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (24): Innovation under
scrutiny - R &amp; D, from technology push to market pull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AS the shock waves of fiercer competition and accelerating structural change
flow through world computer markets, debate is intensifying on both sides of
the Atlantic about the policy measures needed to stimulate faster innovation
in information technology industries.
The debate is broad because the nature of innovation and the ingredients
which contribute to it are hard to pin down precisely. Most studies identify
a wide range of contributing factors, including the macro-economic
environment, industry structure, education and training, management culture
and capital markets.
Most of these elements, however, respond to policy changes only over the
longer term. Hence the search for faster-acting remedies has frequently
focused on deepening the technology base by stepping up investment in
research and development and encouraging research collaboration between
companies and universities.
Since the early 1980s, subsidised joint research programmes such as Esprit
have constituted the main thrust of European Community efforts to enhance
the competitiveness of its electronics industry. In the US, there has been a
growth of industry consortia such as Sematech, the MCC and the SRC.
The trend has been inspired partly by the mounting costs of staying at the
forefront of electronic technologies and partly by the widespread belief
that government-orchestrated collaboration has played a decisive role in the
rise of Japan's electronics industry.
So far, industry performance has not perceptibly improved. Many larger US
computer makers, including IBM, are suffering a severe profit squeeze, while
in Europe the industry is fighting for survival as heavy losses at companies
including Philips, Nixdorf and Bull have prompted drastic retrenchment and
restructuring.
Why has the industry failed to respond? One explanation was given in a
recent paper by Dr Brian Oakley, former head of the Alvey programme, a
five-year electronics industry research project launched by the UK
government in the mid-1980s.
He says that though Alvey achieved its technical goals, few of the
participating companies turned the resulting research into successful
products. That suggests that the weak link in the innovation chain is not a
shortage of good technology but companies' failure to exploit it
commercially.
A broadly similar conclusion is supported by a number of recent studies of
government-sponsored industry collaboration in Japan. These suggest that
government schemes played only a minor role, and that the Japanese
industry's strength owes much more to the stimulus of fierce competition on
its home market and to the structure and organisation of individual
companies.
In successful Japanese electronics manufacturers, research and development
are much more tightly integrated with production and marketing than in
western industry. A team approach ensures the rapid feedback of information
between all concerned - including suppliers and sub-contractors - at every
stage of the process.
Unlike western companies, which have traditionally viewed innovation as a
sequence of separate leaps forward, in Japan it is a continuous process
achieved by simultaneous incremental advances across a broad front.
Typically, Japanese manufacturers have many more, smaller development
projects under way at once than do their western counterparts.
The benefits of the Japanese system include shorter product development
cycles and greater flexibility in responding rapidly to market changes.
Furthermore, by spreading their development effort across so many different
projects, Japanese companies are less vulnerable to the consequences of
individual product failures.
Stung by Japanese competition, many western technology companies are seeking
to speed up innovation by attacking barriers between research, product
development and manufacturing. IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Philips and
Daimler-Benz have all recently taken steps to strip away layers of
bureaucracy which slow down their response time.
However, turning technology into manufactured products efficiently is only
one aspect of the challenge facing the computer industry. Indeed, as even
Japanese suppliers are discovering, it is no more than a necessary condition
for staying in the race.
As technology becomes ever more mobile, component prices continue to fall
and product lives grow shorter, many types of computer hardware are becoming
low-margin commodities. That trend - which is being accelerated by the
spread of open systems standards - is compelling manufacturers to seek more
of their value-added downstream by competing on functions, services and
software.
As this process gathers momentum, the driving force behind the computer
industry's development is shifting from technology push to market pull.
Increasingly, innovation is stimulated by the way in which computer power is
applied, rather than by the specifications of the equipment used to deliver
it.
That has placed more influence in the hands of users, particularly larger
ones, and is obliging suppliers to tailor information systems ever more
closely to the organisation and specific requirements of individual
customers.
A number of western manufacturers, such as IBM and ICL, have responded to
that trend by directing more of their marketing effort into alliances with
partners which possess intimate knowledge of specific industry sectors.
Japanese computer companies are starting to realise that they can no longer
rely simply on technical and manufacturing excellence to sustain their
growth. Fujitsu's recent acquisition of ICL was heavily influenced by the
Japanese company's desire to improve its access to European markets and to
benefit from the British company's expertise in systems integration.
Over the longer term, this is likely to mean that computer manufacturers'
competitive performance will depend critically on the sophistication and
quality of demand in their main markets. Furthermore, as information
technology becomes more pervasive and deeply-embedded, the economic benefits
it confers will be found increasingly in its application, rather than its
production.
However, the heavy preoccupation among western policy makers with technology
as the main competitive battlefield suggests that they have still to absorb
the full implications of these trends. If their efforts to strengthen the
performance of the computer industry are to bear fruit, they will almost
certainly need to widen their focus beyond the supply side and place more
weight on measures to stimulate vigorous demand.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (23): Moore's law passes the
test of time - Memory Devices, a prime driving force in computer
developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime driving force behind the panoply of developments in computing has
been the ever-increasing availability of memory. It is considered quite
normal for a portable computer to have more main memory and on-line disk
storage than could have been crammed into a mainframe system 15 or 20 years
ago.
A significant element in such developments has been the fundamental law of
semiconductor manufacturing first postulated by Mr Gordon Moore, chairman of
Intel. This states that the number of transistors which can be designed into
a given circuit area doubles every 18 months.
This law has held true since Intel developed the first semiconductor memory
in the late 1960s. This held just 1,024 binary bits, roughly equivalent to
20 words of text. In the intervening 20 years, the capacity of a
conventional Dynamic Random Access Memory (Dram) has risen to 4 Mbits, the
equivalent of about 77,000 words of text.
The next big step, to Drams holding 16 Mbits, will take that figure to about
300,000 words per chip.
The availability of this capability to store programs and data has created a
large demand for it, which in turn has led to a continual stream of new
players entering the market and, in their turn, dominating it.
At the start it was US manufacturers such as Intel, National Semiconductor,
Mostek and Motorola. However, in a highly competitive market with high
demand, and with other product lines such as microprocessors to service,
they were soon overtaken by other companies that specialised in memory
production.
These were the Japanese suppliers that still dominate the semiconductor
memory business, such as Hitachi, NEC and Fujitsu. It is they that have
taken the lead, not only in memory product, but also in research and
development in the area. Few US companies now bother making memory chips at
all.
Because of the nature of semiconductor manufacture, where the investment
required to make devices of this capacity is large whether 1m or 2m are
produced, the volume production skills and benevolent investment climate of
Japan was always likely to make those companies significant in the market.
Similar circumstances are leading manufacturers in other Asia Pacific
countries to target the Japanese suppliers.
Well-known names from Singaporean, Tiawanese and Korean consumer
electronics, such as Samsung, Goldstar, Daewoo and Hyundai, are established
as suppliers of leading edge devices that rival the dominant Japanese for
capacity, quality, quantity and price.
There is a certain irony in this last factor, for they are proving to be
highly price competitive at a time when their presence is creating the
potential of an over-supply of components.
This same sequence of events brought the Japanese suppliers to prominence in
the first place when their aggressive pricing on world markets pushed most
US semiconductor manufacturers out of the memory business and prompted the
imposition of trade tariffs and sanctions by the US.
The fact that Moore's Law continues to hold true means that it is perfectly
possible to predict the future capacity of memory devices, and when they
might appear. Not only brute capacity will feature, for by the turn of the
century it is confidently predicted that a wide range of special purpose
memory devices will have appeared.
For example, the turn of the century should see a technology capable of
producing 512 Mbit memory chips but there is, according to companies such as
Fujitsu, a more important market in using some of that potential capacity to
produce other functionality on the same chip.
It could be possible, for example, to provide logic circuitry on a 256 Mbit
chip that will allow the memory to be customised to suit the requirements of
a specific application.
Fujitsu suggest it would be possible to include several current state of the
art 32-bit processors in just one corner of such a memory chip, with other
logic such as analog to digital converters - important for turning
real-world measurements into a form which can be handled by a digital
computer - also squeezed on to the same device.
Such a memory could have wide-ranging applications in industry, engineering
and commerce, simply because it would be re-programmable.
Another area which is expected to see rapid developments is the Flash Eprom,
a type of Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory which offers high capacity,
non-volatility and a fast re-write capability.
What this means in practice is that companies such as Intel, which is a
leader in this particular technology, can produce memory cards the size of a
credit-card for portable computers and other space/size critical
applications that can be written to with applications and data, stored
safely without the need to be electrically refreshed, be read from as often
as needed, and be erased and over-written as required.
In all but two important areas, price and capacity, this is an excellent
semiconductor analogy of the magnetic hard disk system. Even the most
enthusiastic semiconductor suppliers do not see the technology, which boasts
1Mbyte memory cards, taking over from the hard disk in the near or
medium-term future as the prime vehicle for on-line data storage.
For shear on-line, available data storage capacity, the magnetic disk is
still waiting to be beaten. It is also unbeaten on the classic measure of
price per megabyte of storage.
The manufacturers show no signs of giving up such advantages without a
fight. Conner Peripherals, the leading US purveyor of small disk systems,
has helped to open up the burgeoning notebook PC market by producing systems
using disks just 2.5 inches in diameter, yet capable of storing more than 20
Mbytes of data.
At the other extreme, high capacity 5.25 inch disks are being cascaded
together in desk-side PC systems from the likes of Dell and Compaq to
provide over 1 Gigabyte of capacity - more than many a mainframe system.
The long-standing role of magnetic tape as the medium for storing archive
data is under threat. Variations on the CD-ROM, based on established Compact
Disk Technology, are providing much higher capacities in a safer and more
usable form. In addition, they are starting to prove an excellent delivery
vehicle for comprehensive published data, such as directory information.
Most important of all, they open up new markets for companies to publish
vital product information such as documentation. Using multi-media systems,
such information can be shown in many new forms, including speech, videos
and animations, as well as the old standby of text.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (22): Testing the water for
entry to mainstream - Imaging and Scanning, an immature technology grows up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE technology for scanning documents is most commonly seen in the
ubiquitous fax machine. It is not complex: a scanner detects the presence of
shaded dots on the page and then converts this information into an easily
manipulated stream of ones and zeros.
In spite of the relative simplicity of the technology, document scanners for
reading this information into computers are still rare.
Scanners have, for the most part, been eschewed as an immature technology
although the big banks have long used scanners for automatically reading
cheques and simple forms, and supermarkets and manufacturers have bar-code
readers to identify products.
For at least 10 years, market forecasters have been predicting an explosive
growth in the use of scanning and its related applications, most notably
document image processing (DIP).
So far, almost all the projections have proved to be optimistic, many of
them wildly so, but there are at last signs that DIP is about to enter the
mainstream and that market growth rates are accelerating. As a result, all
the big computer and office equipment suppliers are introducing products and
investing heavily in research and development.
There are several reasons why image processing has remained a niche
activity.
The specialist equipment can be expensive; in addition to the scanners for
reading documents or other items, a user must have software to manage the
information, terminals with big clear screens for displaying the images, and
powerful computers and high capacity disks for holding large amounts of
information.
Software for converting the scanned image into character-based text (optical
character recognition) and for managing the movement of images (usually
known as workflow) has only recently reached a point where it is widely
available, reliable and cost-effective.
Most of the products available have not been developed with specific
applications in mind. This means that potential users must customise their
systems and develop their own application specific software. Inevitably,
this has limited the market.
'The problem is that vendors have been selling the technology as a
technology, not as a solution to a business problem,' says Mr David Kelly,
document management systems marketing manager for computer supplier NCR.
Users often end up developing simple, sometimes ineffective systems: 'If you
look at the applications, they are not very sophisticated, nor as widespread
as the technology will allow,' he says.
Image systems have been developed separately from other business
applications. The big banks and insurance companies which have invested in
DIP systems have all struggled with the issue of how to integrate their
image applications with their traditional business applications.
The technical problems of putting effective image systems together have been
compounded by a simple one of scale: a normal A4 page of wordprocessor text
takes up about 1 kilobyte of computer memory or disk space, but a scanned A4
page can take up as much as 30K to 80K of memory (depending on complexity).
Such large volumes of information can quickly fill up magnetic disks and
clog up communications networks.
Each of these obstacles is now being tackled and to a large extent overcome.
The cost of raw computer power has fallen rapidly over 10 years, while
optical disk technology has solved the storage problem: each compact disk
can store thousands of scanned images.
Compression techniques, high-speed local area networks and high band width
communication lines have solved the document distribution problem and now
make it feasible for scanned images to be distributed across large
companies.
Scanners have improved and fallen in price, with the Japanese taking a
growing market share. At the top end, specialist scanners for reading
cheques can read up to 400,000 documents a day, some reading both sides.
Full colour scanners, although still expensive, are also finding their way
into some desk top publishing applications.
The biggest market for document scanners is at the low end, where quality is
improving and costs are falling. Kurzweil, a leading supplier, has a system
in the Pounds 15,000 bracket which can read up to 50 pages a minute at a
high-quality 400 dots-per-inch resolution.
Hand-held scanners for attaching to personal computers are available for a
few hundred pounds. Last year, an international group called the Scanner
Programmers Interface Association announced they were developing
international standards to make it far easier to use scanners with simple
office software programs.
Until now, fax machines, photocopiers and computer-attached scanners have
been separate devices serving separate purposes. But some suppliers believe
that eventually the use of 'scan servers' will become widespread: documents
will be scanned once and automatically indexed, after which any user on an
office network can make copies, distribute them electronically, or
manipulate them on-screen.
Xerox, developer of the photocopier and the inventor of the windows
graphical user interfaces used by Apple and others, is leading the way. It
announced in October 1990 that in the US the Xerox Docutech Production
Publisher 'will ignite a revolution as profound as the introduction of the
first plain paper copier in 1959'. The system can be used to scan colour
images from paper, manipulate them on-screen using 'cut and paste'
techniques, and print up to 135 high quality copies a minute. But it is not
cheap: an initial configuration costs in the region of Dollars 220,000.
The most impressive examples of document image processing in use can be seen
in the financial sector, where the big paper-bound institutions have
developed corporate-sized systems. Norwich Union, for example, recently
revealed its new mainframe-based insurance claims handling system, based on
IBM's Imageplus system. Eventually, it intends to deliver document images to
as many 10,000 terminals throughout the organisation.
The benefits of image processing can be seen at Royal Life, part of the
Royal Insurance Group. It installed an Olivetti Filenet document image
processing system in late 1989 to store copies of its pension plan
documents. It has spent a bout Pounds 500,000 on the computer hardware and
about Pounds 300,000 on software.
The Filenet system is being used to hold about 180,000 executive pension
plan documents which have been scanned in and are then stored on video disks
which can hold up to 40,000 A4 pages. The Filenet scanner is theoretically
capable of scanning 40,000 A4 pages a day; Royal Life uses it to process
3,000 a day (it is not an automatic process; each document needs to be
scanned, checked and indexed in a process which takes about 20 minutes per
page).
Before the system was installed, the paper files were kept in vast archives.
Existing policies took several days to retrieve manually and new policies
took between eight and 30 days to process. Financial intermediaries
frequently complained about the long delays.
Now, new policies can be processed within 24 hours, while checking on
existing policies is immediate. 'We can get any A4 page off the system in
between two and 17 1/2 seconds,' says Mr Alex Littlejohn, Royal Life's
customer service manager.
The fastest growth in demand for image processing applications is being seen
at companies such as Royal Life, where there is a serious paper storage and
management problem which is affecting business efficiency. According to
market researchers Ovum, the price of a typical multi-user DIP system will
fall from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 400,000 over the next four years,
attracting thousands of new customers.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (21): Computer virus is the
biggest threat to companies - Security, or confidentiality, integrity and
availability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN computer systems were monolithic machines in air-cooled offices, locked
away from most of the employees, the security of the data was relatively
easy to guarantee. But the pervasiveness of personal computing and computer
networking now means that almost every employee in many large companies has
access to the main computer. Ensuring the data is not maliciously altered or
misappropriated is therefore increasingly difficult to achieve.
Most organisations are beginning to realise the importance of sound security
measures. According to accountants Price Waterhouse, security accounts for 9
per cent of expenditure on new computer systems, up from 5 per cent, five
years ago. Today only 5 per cent of companies spend nothing on it compared
to 25 per cent in the mid-1980s.
One difficulty for commercial organisations is that there is no single
source of risk: instead companies have to secure what is known as the 'CIA'
of computer data:
'Confidentiality' - so that only those who are authorised to see or alter
the information can do so.
'Integrity' - to ensure the information is not changed.
'Availability' - to guarantee the computer is operating correctly when
required.
One of the biggest threats to companies is the computer virus, says Mr Peter
Jenner, business manager of PA Consulting's security consultancy centre. In
the UK, both Rolls-Royce and British Rail, for example, have experienced
viruses this year.
Viruses, computer codes which replicate themselves from one computer to
another and destroy the integrity of the data, come in a wide variety of
forms, many with exotic names. With the 'cascade' virus, for example, all
the characters fall from the top of the screen into a pile at the bottom.
While with the 'Italian' virus a ping-pong ball bounces across the computer
screen.
Virus checking software is available from companies such as Sophos, of
Abingdon, SS International, of Berkhamsted, and International Data Security,
of London. It works by checking for the individual pattern that every virus
leaves in the program.
However, virus developers see the increasing sophistication of anti-virus
software as a challenge to develop ever more complex viruses, says Mr Chris
Frost, senior manager in the European data security division of Price
Waterhouse, making it increasingly difficult to spot the interloper. The
latest stealth viruses change their identification code every time the
program is loaded - so the detection system cannot look for a specific
string of code.
Other viruses are armoured to prevent detection. When they latch on to a
program they encrypt it entirely, making it difficult for the scanning
software to detect where the virus code begins and ends. Other viruses have
even been developed that remove themselves altogether from the program when
the detection software is run.
As often as not, viruses are introduced into a company by an employee
bringing in his or her own floppy disk to play computer games at lunchtime.
Far more sinister is the hacker who breaks into the computer system by
imitating the sign-on procedure of a company employee - by using his or her
computer password.
The biggest problem with computer passwords is that employees often do not
take them seriously - they are likely to use the name of their spouse,
children or pet dog as the password, all of which can be easily guessed by
the would-be hacker. Or they use series of easily guessed numbers, or even
the word 'password' itself.
To overcome this the latest software packages contain lists of unacceptable
passwords - up to 20,000 words of them in some cases. More secure means of
preventing unauthorised access to computer systems are on the market or
under development. One is biometric devices, such as retina scanners,
thumbprint recognition machines and sign-on machines where users have to
sign their name.
While somebody can change their password into a computer system easily
enough, it is impossible to change a thumb print, or a retina, but this can
bring drawbacks. Once a hacker has taken a thumbprint, for example, they can
gain access to the computer system repeatedly without anyone noticing.
More complex are combinations of hardware and software. Dynamic password
tokens, for example, use devices about the size of a credit card which
produce a new numeric password every few seconds. This change is controlled
by an algorithm, or mathematical formula, which is synchronised with the
mainframe's software. To use the system the user types in a name and
password, and then types in the password that is displayed at that moment on
the token.
Once a hacker gets into a computer system the results can be horrendous. The
widespread use of computer systems in financial applications - payroll,
funds transfer or bill payment - has offered organised crime a lucrative
opportunity for replacing the security van robbery with split-second
electronic fraud.
Most frauds are discovered by regular checks, but expert computer systems
are helping to minimise the cost of these. In the case of a bank, for
example, the expert system would be programmed to know that a Pounds 1,000
transaction at an exclusive clothes shop would probably be genuine, whereas
a transaction of the same amount from the local supermarket would not.
There is a growing awareness among computer companies that their operating
systems software must be made more difficult to crack. ICL, for example, now
offers a high-security version of its VME operating system for commercial
use which incorporates mandatory controls: files cannot be moved from one
section of the computer to another - from accounts, say, to manufacturing.
Such security measures have also been adopted for the Unix operating system,
with the latest version of Posix - which interfaces between Unix and the
applications software - having the capability to create these mandatory
controls.
Last but not least, computer manufacturers and consultants are selling their
wares as disaster recovery companies. Back-up sites and mobile computer
units are there to ensure that even if your computer room is flooded or
struck by lightning, your business is not destroyed as well.

COMPUTER workstations are 'not just for 'techies' anymore', Sun
Microsystems, market leader, has declared.
These high performance desktop computers have until recently been aimed
primarily at engineering and scientific applications. Sun and others see a
new market opportunity for workstations as high-powered business computers.
'The mass penetration of workstations into markets dominated by personal
computers, minicomputers and mainframes isn't a future event - it has
already happened,' Sun claims.
The marriage of computer workstation performance with the vast software base
of the PC is luring dozens of computer makers and software developers into
this emerging market. PC companies such as Compaq Computer and Apple
Computer are planning to build more powerful desktop machines based upon
Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessors borrowed from the
engineering workstation world.
Workstation manufacturers such as Sun, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard
are targeting business users as well as their traditional engineering and
scientific markets. The technical features and market characteristics that
divide the PC and workstation markets are fast disappearing.
Business applications are increasingly being ported to varieties of the Unix
operating system which is widely used on engineering workstations. The raw
data processing power of the PC vies with that of low end workstations.
Distribution patterns are also overlapping.
Traditionally, workstations have been sold primarily by direct sales forces
or through value-added resellers who add specialised software. Increasingly,
however, workstations are being offered by the computer dealers and retail
outlets that dominate the PC market. However, as workstations enter the
business market a conflict between PC and workstation software standards has
arisen.
While Microsoft's DOS operating system dominates the PC world, Unix - in
various forms - is the operating system of choice for workstations. Backers
of the Advanced Computindustry consortium of 21 companies, have declared
their support for both a future unified version of Unix and a future version
of Microsoft's OS/2 operating system.
Members of the group acknowledge that they are hedging their bets, until it
becomes clearer which way the business workstation market will move. The
emergence of workstations as business computers has added to the fierce
competition in all sectors of the Dollars 7.5bn workstation market.
Sales of workstations are expected to total Dollars 9.2bn this year and
reach over Dollars 12bn in 1992, according to Dataquest, the market research
company. Sun Microsystems is the clear winner in workstations, with a
dominant 32 per cent market share.
Sun's combination of the Sparc Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)
microprocessor and SunOS version of Unix has attracted several licensed
cloners who offer Sun-compatible computers.
Sun's strategy has been to establish Sparc as an industry standard and
mostly through the success of its own products it is succeeding. Industry
analysts predict that Sun will continue to lead the workstation market
throughout the early 1990s although International Business Machines may
aggressively challenge Sun.
'By 1992-93 Sun and IBM may tie for first place among workstation vendors,'
predicts Ms Vicki Brown of International Data.
IBM has made a remarkable resurgence in the workstation market since its
introduction, a year ago, of a range of products based upon its own RISC
design.
The company sold Dollars 1bn-worth of its RS/6000 workstations in 1990 and
gained a 6.6 per cent share in the market. Sales are expected to rise to
Dollars 1.7bn-Dollars 2bn this year.
Hewlett-Packard, the number two workstation vendor, lost market share in
1990 but is expected to make a strong recovery this year with the recent
introduction of a new product range.
Using an enhanced version of the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)
architecture upon which its minicomputers are based, HP has taken a
technological leapfrog to produce machines that greatly outperform
comparably priced workstations from its main competitors.
HP's new top of the range Series 700 Model 730 workstation is twice as fast
as IBM's fastest workstation, and 3.5 times the performance of Sun
Microsystems Sparcstation 3, HP claims.
Digital Equipment saw its share of the workstation market reduced in 1990 to
17 per cent from 23 per cent in the previous year, according to IDC.
Digital is aggressively supporting Ace, the Advanced Computing Environment
initiative, and plans to upgrade its DEC station product line with new
workstations based upon the powerful R4000 Mips computer RISC chip, when
that device becomes available.
'Marketing prowess and execution - not pure technology - will ultimately
determine the winners in the workstation market,' predicts Ms Brown of IDC.
A challenge for all workstation participants will be to maintain profit
margins as average workstation prices fall and to adjust to new distribution
channels as the market for workstations expands.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (19): 'Let the industry do
what it does best' - Reverse Engineering, conflict and compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

REVERSE engineering, the practice of unravelling a competitor's product to
learn how it works in order either to emulate it or to attach proprietary
equipment, achieved unlikely political notoriety last year after a European
Commission draft directive designed to protect software makers unleashed one
of the fiercest bouts of lobbying ever witnessed in Brussels or Strasbourg.
The purpose of the draft directive was both simple and honourable; to
protect the creators and suppliers of personal computer software who are
being cheated annually of about Pounds 3bn in Europe through unauthorised
copying of their products.
The idea was to eliminate existing disparities between the copyright
protection systems for software in the member states as part of the
Commission's general plans for the harmonisation of EC law for 1992.
As such, it was supported to the hilt by organisations such as the Business
Software Alliance, the Software Publishers Association, and the Federation
Against Software Theft.
The Business Software Alliance, established by six of the world's leading PC
software suppliers - Aldus (desk top publishing) Ashton Tate (database)
Autodesk (computer aided draughting) Lotus (spreadsheets) Microsoft
(operating systems) and Wordperfect (word processing), has taken a leading
role in initiating legal proceedings against companies it believes guilty of
software theft.
However, what turned a commonsense measure designed to protect software
companies in a uniform manner across Europe into a political hot potato was
the fine detail in the draft. Computer manufacturers realised quickly that
the provisions of the directive would specifically forbid unauthorised
reverse engineering and in doing so, hamper their efforts to compete with
the leaders of the industry such as International Business Machines (IBM)
and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).
A campaign led by the hastily formed European Committee for Interoperable
Systems (ECIS), to persuade members of the European parliament and the
Commission to modify the directive was immediately initiated.
The software suppliers, together with IBM and DEC who saw the opportunity
legally to forbid Japanese manufacturers access to their technology, took
the opposite line and for some months the two lobbies fought a fierce war of
words.
It was not surprising that the Commission's draftsmen failed to anticipate
the scale of the row they were to precipitate. Reverse engineering, while
simple in concept is complex in detail and the extent to which it is used is
essential. Furthermore, its use in the computer industry is rarely
appreciated by outsiders.
It is an easy concept to understand in conventional engineering. Automobile
manufacturers routinely take their competitor's vehicles apart to see what
makes them tick. So what is reverse engineering in computer software?
It is software archaeology, according to Mr Gilles Lafue, a software
specialist with Andersen Consulting. 'It consists of extracting the
software's functionality (what the software does) and the design (how it
does it) by analysing the software's implementation - that is, programming
code, data structures, files and databases.'
It is necessary because of the dominant position of a small number of
manufacturers who are able to set de facto standards for data processing
systems. That means essentially IBM and DEC. Other manufacturers must so
design their equipment that it can be connected to IBM's or DEC's if they
are to have a share of the data processing cake. To do so, they have to
understand the design of the connection, or interface, in great detail.
That knowledge can be acquired either directly from IBM or DEC - leaving the
competitor at the mercy of the industry leaders - or it can obtained by
reverse engineering with or without their permission.
Of course, reverse engineering can be used to create a competitive product
through copying or improving on the original which is why software makers
are keen to have it banned. Many of the best software innovations are not
patented but simply hidden away in thousands of lines of computer code to
prevent copying; legal reverse engineering, the software specialists
complain, would be tantamount to a plagiarist's charter.
It was not simply hardware manufacturers and software houses who were upset.
Europe's computer users realised their ability to carry out essential
maintenance on their software would be hindered by the directive.
(Maintenance, in the software business, means modifying and extending
existing programs rather than repair.)
A compromise position was reached in December last year when a version of
the directive was agreed in Brussels which provided for:
Classification of software as literary works
A definition of originality
A common term of protection in accordance with the Berne Convention
Legal reverse engineering in limited circumstances.
These circumstances are when the retrieval of information is confined to the
parts of the original program necessary for inter-operability, when the
information retrieved is not communicated to third parties except to the
extent necessary for the operation of the new program and the information
retrieved is not used to create or market a program that infringes a
copyright in the original program.
The compromise proved broadly satisfactory to the hardware manufacturers and
to the software suppliers. However, the issue has continued to spark
controversy.
Earlier this month, the European parliament's committee on Legal Affairs and
Citizen's Rights proposed 11 amendments to the draft directive which clarify
the scope of the directive for research and analysis and the status of
interfaces between hardware and software under copyright law.
It has resulted in a new round of lobbying with ECIS in the forefront of a
campaign to persuade MEPs to vote in favour of most of the amendments.
Meanwhile, the Business Software Alliance which represents over 800
publishers of PC software, has decided it is time to call a halt.
In an open letter to the legal affair committee earlier in the year it said:
'After over a year of extended lobbying, it was finally possible last
December to reach a compromise that virtually the whole computer industry
could accept. We believe that it is now time to include all of the lobbying
and political debate and let the industry get back to what it does best -
producing hardware and software - under the terms of this compromise'.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (18): Software takes the
driving seat - Mid-Range Systems, hardware architectures under review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE undeniable driving force in much of the mid-range systems market is
systems software, and in particular Unix and the broader issues of open
systems. These, in turn, are changing some of the rules that govern
mid-range hardware architectures.
Unix is insinuating its way into a position of dominance in the mid-range
market, and the leading manufacturers are all reacting to it. Some, such as
Digital Equipment (DEC), have arguably come to it somewhat later than
others, while IBM is at last showing some signs that is taking the subject
seriously.
The operating system is starting to have an impact on the way mid-range
systems are designed and built. Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) chip
sets are increasingly the order of the day, for example, and those systems
manufacturers that do not have their own designs are signing supply and
technology licensing agreements with those that do.
DEC is committed to the RISC chips produced by MIPS Computer, so much so
that it holds a minority stake in the company. The MIPS-based DEC Station
systems are still largely at the low-end of the company's product range, but
MIPS has a new, more powerful 64-bit processor on the drawing board, which
is likely to form the basis of any successor to DEC's successful VAX
minicomputer architecture.
These chips lie at the heart of the new consortium of leading hardware and
software companies, known both as the 'Gibraltar Group' and the Advanced
Computing Environment (ACE) group, which is aiming to build a new industry
standard for both the lower reaches of mid-range systems and workstations.
Most estimates suggest that the first new machines built to this standard
will not appear for three years.
Evidence to bear this out comes indirectly from DEC, which is pressurising
its existing VAX users into updating their applications code to take
advantage of future RISC systems within three years, otherwise they will be
effectively locked out of future open systems developments. The company
plans to shift to RISC-based systems and away from the VAX architecture in
the long term.
Prime targets for the ACE group are Sun Microsystems, which claims to own
about 60 per cent of the workstation and low-end mid-range market place, and
a newly reinvigorated IBM, which has scored some significant recent
successes with its own RISC-based machines, the RS/6000 range.
Sun Microsystems is fast becoming an important player in the mid-range
market, not only for its own systems but also for its SPARC RISC-chip set,
which is being aggressively marketed to other systems vendors. Several names
in the mid-range market, with UK's ICL leading the way, have signed up to
use the SPARC chip set and have established their own systems in the market
place. The chip set offers systems builders a scalable platform, allowing
them to develop machines that range from 12 mips (million instructions per
second) workstations to 100 mips superminicomputers, all running the same
operating system and applications software.
Stretching from the desktop workstation through to large corporate server
systems, the IBM RS/6000 has ruffled some feathers among established Unix
mid-range suppliers by winning an order for 2,500 systems from Barclays
Bank. This cuts across the standard industry perception that IBM only pays
lip-service to Unix, and even then takes an alternative stance by having its
own version of the system, a extensively re-engineered superset of the Unix
standard called AIX.
From the company's early efforts in the RISC-based workstation and mid-range
markets with the 6150, which were generally considered to be down on
performance and up on price in comparison with the competition, the
completely re-worked RS/6000 series looks like making a success of itself.
This, in turn, may prompt IBM to take an even more positive stance about it,
rather than always managing to give the impression that it is something of
an afterthought to other, more strategic product families.
In this context, the company's main mid-range offering is the AS/400 family.
Though by most other manufacturer's standards it would be considered a large
success, sales of these machines have generally been considered as somewhat
disappointing. It has largely been seen as the replacement for the company's
old System 3/X line of minicomputers which have a good, if stolid reputation
in the traditional small and medium-sized business market.
System 3X replacement sales have been good for the AS/400, but its
penetration into new markets, especially those dominated by DEC with its VAX
systems, has not been excessive.
The machine has been plagued recently with technical problems, particularly
in the area of disk storage. It has been found that disk drives for the
machine are suffering from excessive vibration which causes disk crashes and
consequent failure of the system. What has made this worse is the fact that
the system software is spread across all drives used on an AS/400, which
means they all must work for the system to work.
AS/400 users are subject to the changing pricing policies that can come with
such proprietary systems. Recent changes in IBM's software pricing for this
machine have left users that upgrade their existing systems facing a 50 per
cent jump in software costs for enhanced code that had previously been free.
One growing trend in the mid-range market is towards multiprocessor systems
built around common devices such as the Intel i486 processor. One of the
leading contenders, Sequent, has systems available using as many as 18 of
these devices, offering a capability of servicing up to 500 users.
NCR has recently announced systems using a similar architecture which, like
the Sequent system, runs Unix. Once again, the basis of the trend is towards
scale in both the hardware architecture and the applications software to
give mid-range users maximum flexibility.
Such systems go some way towards meeting the growing need for fault
tolerance by the simple expedient of using a lot of processors. This is only
a partial solution, however, and rarely satisfies those users with
business-critical applications that demand the maximum in reliability.
That market place remains the domain of two main contenders, Stratus
Computers and, the market leader, Tandem. The latter's Integrity S2 machines
use multiple processors, but instead of tasks being shared out among a
number of small units, these use large processors to run the applications
together, monitoring each other's output and voting between them to discover
and isolate faults.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (17): Right-size gains
credence - Mainframes, life in the old system yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE mainframe computer will it not lie down and die. It continues to
demonstrate it has a viable, long-term place in information processing and
management, in spite of the inevitable effects of the recession, and the
continuing suggestion that it is to be supplanted by a collective of
mid-range, workstation and PC systems.
One of the main assumptions in the suggested demise of the mainframe, and
one which has had a significant impact of late, is downsizing. This is the
concept that, as technology allows the same performance to be packed into an
ever-smaller physical size, so the need for the big boxes will diminish to
an eventual vanishing point of economic non-viability.
The evidence is now starting to point away from this inevitability. Instead,
the term 'right-sizing' is starting to gain credence. With that credence
comes an appreciation that the mainframe will continue to have an important
role. What is more the corollary of downsizing, that the technology will be
exploited to add more power and performance to a system of any given
physical size and price, will provide continued justification for that role.
Right-sizing takes as its basis the fact that different types of
applications in information management require different systems
architectures to run them most efficiently. Therefore, while it is far more
sensible to run a highly user-interactive mix of spreadsheeting, graphics
and text report writing applications together on a PC, the same platform is
totally inadequate as the host of a large, on-line transaction processing
system.
Here, there is really no alternative to a large mainframe installation and
an extensive disk farm of on-line data storage. As such on-line transactions
processing (OLTP) systems are the life-blood of most large corporations,
such as the financial institutions, there is unlikely to be any significant
reduction in either the role of or demand for mainframe systems.
The main differentiator that defines mainframes, minicomputers and
workstations/PCs, is the relationship between an application's data and
functionality.
An application that is data-rich but functionally poor, such as OLTP or
large database management, is ideally suited to a mainframe solution.
Applications with the inverse ratio suit the workstation/PC, while the
minicomputer matches applications which require a reasonable mix of these
two elements.
The fact that there is still very much a role for mainframes has not meant a
healthy flow of business for the manufacturers. Industry-leader IBM
indicated that the slump in its business, thought to have been stemmed
following a good fourth quarter last year, looks set to continue for at
least the first half of this year.
The company has laid the blame on the spreading recession throughout Europe
and Japan, though US analysts, such as Mr Ulric Weil of Weil Associates,
have suggested that downsizing aspirations by customers is also having a
considerable impact on the company's mainframe sales.
There is a negative impact felt from the problems in computer leasing
business, which has been a significant sales route through which IBM has
reached its customer base.
The recession is, a big worry for IBM's mainframe business, for it has
followed smartly on its introduction of a complete new range of systems, the
System/390 range, described by Mr Tony Cleaver, IBM chairman and chief
executive, as the biggest and most important announcement for a quarter of
century.
In spite of that significance, sales of systems in the range have been slow,
except for a small increase which occurred during the fourth quarter last
year. Then, sales of the most powerful, six processor systems, the ES/9000
Model 900, and the top of the entry-level machines, Models 330 and 340, rose
sharply.
This looks as though it has been a temporary excursion, and that sales will
continue slowly. As well as the problems of recession, the machines mark a
fairly radical step function both in performance and compatibility with the
the existing IBM mainframe product family, the 370 Series.
There are only a limited number of bridges between the two families, and
users of 370 series machines may first have to upgrade their existing
systems to one of the configurations at which a transition to the equivalent
ES/9000 can be made. There have also been some missed compatibility
opportunities in fairly obvious, even rather silly areas.
For example, the upper range of the ES/9000 series is water-cooled, as are
the 370 series machines, yet they use different diameter piping to supply
the coolant.
In spite of the continued reliance on proprietary architectures and
operating systems from the mainframe suppliers, there are signs that open
systems concepts are now penetrating deeply.
Amdahl, for example, is still the only mainframe supplier to offer an
implementation of Unix as a native operating system on its machines. Others,
including IBM, only offer it as a guest running under the proprietary
operating system.
Unix on the mainframe has been a slow starter, but some users see it as a
way out of being locked in to not only proprietary systems, but the pricing
that can go with them. It offers opportunities in providing more coherent
communications between different hardware platforms, a fundamental element
of open systems, if they are all running broadly the same operating system.
If Unix does become more prominent on mainframe systems, it offers the
chance of greater freedom for the IBM plug compatible systems manufacturers,
which include the likes of Amdahl and Fujitsu.
These have built their businesses on making hardware that runs IBM software
but is cheaper and/or more readily available than IBM kit. Any significant
switch to Unix in the market could allow both them and the users a wider,
more competitive choice of sources for applications software. It could
reverse the current situation and allow a native Unix to act as host to a
manufacturer's existing proprietary operating system. This would provide
current users of proprietary systems with continuity as well as broadening
the choice of upgrade path.

powerful - Printers, concerned about scale

THE trend to downsizing where applications previously carried out on a
mainframe can now often be done on a mini; and the power that one expected
from a mini now being available in today's top of the range PCs is having a
profound effect on the market for printers.
On the one hand, advanced features and performance is required and yet, at
the same time, the market will not bear prices which appear to be out of all
relationship with the falling prices of the PCs to which the devices will be
connected.
Some users want colour, others need improved quality such as higher
resolution (in dots per inch) while many departments need to handle
multi-part forms. Furthermore, a growing proportion of users need a graphics
capability to handle a variety of text fonts and sizes as well as charts and
more complex images. This is a facility which is widely available,
especially in the non-impact page printers.
One long-felt business need is colour to enable, for example, profits/losses
to be more readily seen in a spreadsheet. The simplest way of achieving this
is to use a printer with a two-colour ribbon as was used in a manual
typewriter. Where this would be too slow, colour ink jet and thermal
transfer printers come into their own.
'The market for high quality colour printers is one which, until now, has
been supplied with high priced machines,' says Mr Richard Bright of
Mannesmann Tally, printer manufacturer. 'By introducing a sub-Pounds 2,000
thermal transfer page printer we have significantly reduced the cost of
colour page printing, without sacrificing print quality. What was a
specialist piece of equipment is now available to general business users.'
According to BIS CAP International the European colour printer market is set
to expand from 170,000 units in 1990 to 500,000 in 1994 and will be worth
about Dollars 1.3bn by 1994. The UK printer market is likely to grow from
45,000 units in 1990 to 180,000 in 1994. It will be worth Dollars 400m by
1994.
While, no doubt, some of this growth will come from normal business users, a
growing proportion will be in computer-aided design (CAD) and desktop
publishing where users will be able to get a colour representation of their
documents before going out to print in high volume.
The widely-used laser printer with its 300 x 300 dots per inch (DPI)
resolution is frequently not considered adequate for DTP. Hence, once the
work has been completed on the Macintosh (or PC), the actual camera-ready
artwork is prepared on a higher resolution printer often of more than 1,000
DPI.
Bridging the two markets is the Qume CrystalPrint Express. Not only does
this 12 page per minute (appreciably faster than the average laser printer)
provide 600 x 300 resolution which is adequate for many applications it
incorporates a number of interfaces (including AppleTalk) and emulations
which together offer the compatibility required when the printer is a
'shared resource' on a local area network (LAN).
Also vying for this market are other versatile printers such as the Kodak
Ektaplus 7016 and the HP Laserjet III Si from Hewlett-Packard, the market
leader in the non-impact market. While both of these are 16 pages per minute
(PPM) the former incorporates a 6 PPM photocopier 'designed for those simple
one or two copies tasks common in the busy office environment thus
increasing productivity by reducing waiting time at the photocopier'.
The latter, using HP's resolution enhancement technology together with
microfine toner, is claimed to give resolution akin to that of a 600 DPI
printer. One of its options is that it can have a direct high-speed
connection to a LAN, such as Novell, so obviating the need for a separate PC
as a printer-server. This is far more cost-effective than with many
networked printers.
Laser and ink jet printers are 'non-impact' unlike dot-matrix machines which
tend to have a low-tech image and are often derided for their lower quality
and high noise level. In spite of this they are the workhorses of industry
and commerce and are able to handle multi-part forms which the other
technologies cannot handle. According to Romtec, the market analyst, for
those reasons plus cost they still account for 57 per cent of the UK market
with laser and inkjet holding for 27 and 11.7 per cent respectively.
For example, Epson which tends to be identified as the world's predominant
supplier of dot matrix printers (in spite of claiming to take a growing
share of the non-impact market) produces both general purpose and
specialised products. A good example of the latter is its DFX-1000. This is
a heavy duty system printer which will handle high-speed printing of
multi-part forms at up to 300 lines per minute making it, they believe, the
fastest serial impact printer in the world.
However, Romtec also reports that, during the fourth quarter of 1990, Epson
and Hewlett-Packard had 29.2 and 23.6 per cent respectively of the printer
sales (in units) to business end users via dealers, distributors. Retailers
direct sales by the manufacturers only accounted for a very small
proportion. But, as the Epson business is largely in the lower-cost dot
matrix market, the value of HP's sales is higher.
The dot matrix market is facing tough competition - especially from inkjet
printers - as users become more conscience of the image that their own
printed output creates.
Ms Nicky Ayre, product manager at HP says the Deskjet HP DJ500 is 'the
better alternative to the dot matrix and that there is no longer a
price-penalty to pay for higher quality'. She says HP is focusing on the
higher quality that is being expected by the discerning users. The HP DJ500
is ideal as a personal printer where the requirement is for about 50 pages
per day and is increasingly being installed in people's homes.
It can be seen that there is no universal requirement. As a result, the
variety of printers continues to grow. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find
the collection of features that are needed at an affordable price.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (15): It all depends on the
number of chips - Semiconductors, when is a computer company not a computer
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER

<TEXT>
MR Bernard Giroud, vice-president of Intel, takes strong exception to anyone
calling his organisation a computer company. By contrast, Mr Tom Beaver,
vice-president of Motorola, positively insists on his organisation being
called a computer company.
Regardless of how they prefer to be styled, both of these leading US
semiconductor manufacturers now make products which used to be made by
computer companies. As computer companies concentrate on profitable
activities such as software and systems integration, semiconductor companies
such as Intel and Motorola are spending more of their time manufacturing
computers.
Ten years ago, the computer companies simply provided customers with their
computers. Now the task of traditional computer companies has shifted, says
Mr Giroud. 'The end user is asking for more software, more assistance, more
training,' he says.
As computer companies have moved away from their older manufacturing role,
Intel, the world's leading manufacturer of microprocessors, has moved in.
'We are doing what an ICL or a Nixdorf was doing 10 years ago,' Mr Giroud
says. 'We are making the central processing unit that ICL used to make 10
years ago.'
The reason he insists on Intel not being called a computer company is that
it does not deal directly with the end users of computers. 'A computer
company is a company that sells solutions to the end user. We supply
hardware to the system integrators. They supply the technology to the end
user, combined with the software. We are not in competition with Compaq,
Hewlett-Packard or IBM.'
Motorola, America's biggest semiconductor maker, sees itself as being more
directly involved in the computer industry. Mr Beaver says the company
regards itself as a manufacturer of standard computers, along with their
operating software. The only area in which Motorola is not involved is in
the provision of applications software.
Five years ago Motorola established a separate computer division, which Mr
Beaver heads. One of the reasons why Motorola wanted to move more decisively
into computer manufacture was to help influence the debate over common
operating standards.
The computer industry worldwide has seen a move away from computers which
are unable to communicate with those provided by other manufacturers.
Customers are increasingly insisting on common standards or open systems.
They are demanding that different manufacturers provide computers that can
talk to one another. Motorola makes computers which use A T &amp; T's Unix
operating system.
The move from proprietary to open systems provided Motorola with what it saw
as a commercial opportunity.
'We saw a lot of computer companies struggling through the transition from
proprietary to open systems. We saw a lot of them deciding to become niche
companies, specialising in banking, insurance, what have you. They're
letting someone else build the hardware. We saw that as an opportunity
because our corporation is good at competing in commodity products. We make
computers as a commodity item,' says Mr Beaver.
Mr Beaver says he sees the world computer industry today as being divided
into three groups. The first consists of companies providing a mixture of
computers adhering to both their own and to common operating standards. He
says the American companies IBM, DEC, Unisys and Hewlett-Packard belong in
this category, along with Siemens of Germany.
The second group consists of companies providing computer systems to clients
in particular fields, such as banking or law, and contracting out much of
the hardware manufacture. He puts Wang of the US, Olivetti of Italy, Philips
of the Netherlands and Nixdorf of Germany (now part of Siemens) in this
group.
The third group consists of companies providing products for the open
systems market. NCR, Intel, A T &amp; T, Sun Microsystems and Compaq - all of
the US - fall into this category, as do most of the Japanese computer
companies. So, he says, does Motorola. Participating in a commodity market,
he says, these companies have to sell computers on the basis of price and
performance.
The move by many computer companies away from manufacturing is not the only
reason that some chip companies have become computer manufacturers. Mr
Giroud points out that technological developments mean that computers use
fewer and fewer chips.
'At the moment, you take two chips from Intel, eight chips from someone
else, add the memory, and you have a personal computer. In 1984 or 1985, you
needed 170 chips plus the memory to make a computer. In 1993, the 10 chips
plus the memory you need today will become one chip plus the memory,' Mr
Giroud says.
As the number of chips used in computers shrinks, semiconductor makers
effectively become computer manufacturers. 'What we are doing is we are
putting a PC on a chip,' Mr Giroud says. 'The chips we are designing now
have 4m to 5m transistors.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (14): Three-tier structure
crumbles - Distribution Channels, a year of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LETTICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE past year has seen big changes in the ownership of the companies which
distribute computer equipment in the UK. In general, control of the leading
companies has moved outside of this country.
In the past 12 months Frontline, one of the most successful of UK computer
distributors, has been taken over by German distributor Computer 2000, while
network specialist QDL has fallen to Micro Macro, a Netherlands combine, and
in the past few weeks Software Limited has been taken over by Ingram Micro
of the US.
These changes of ownership are arguably less important than the changes in
the structures of computer distribution channels that have been taking
place.
A few years ago computer distribution channels in the UK could be defined
quite easily. The manufacturer at the top would sell equipment to
distributors, who in their turn would sell it on to computer dealers. But
more recently this three-tier structure has begun to erode.
Pressure on profit margins has encouraged manufacturers to remove the centre
distributor tier, and to deal direct with computer dealers, and even with
customers. At the same time, we have seen the growth of the super dealer,
operations such as Computacenter and Technology which are large enough to
deal directly with suppliers, and dealer/distributors.
The two types of operation meet in the middle, with dealer-led companies
such as Computacenter and Technology becoming, to all intents and purposes,
distributors, and with distribution operations such as Rossendale, adding
computer dealer operations to broaden their base. Pressure on margins is
such that it is difficult to see, in the minds of many analysts, how an
operation that deals solely as an intermediary, taking equipment from a
manufacturer and passing it on to a computer dealer without gaining any
extra profit margin from selling direct to users, can survive.
One danger for the trade-only distributor is that the market will split,
leaving such companies handling mainly the more esoteric product ranges and
lower volume shipments to smaller dealers.
As the bigger dealerships are beginning to show, and as smaller distributors
which move back into direct sales confirms, large amounts of money can be
made through a combination of relatively limited product ranges shipped at
high volumes.
Mr Derek Lewis, head of Technology, argues that large corporate dealerships
such as his own company should concentrate on on two, maybe three ranges of
computer hardware. Mr Lewis's company is a member of Comec, one of two big
European dealer associations, and the implications of this are clear - if
the dealers throughout Europe who are members of Comec decide on an official
range of computers, they can drive a very hard bargain, forcing the margins
of manufacturers down.
This worries Mr Don Pinchbeck, managing director at Epson UK. He feels that
'the reseller who is pan-European can seize power from manufacturers'. Comec
and the International Computer Group (ICG), which is the rival association
of which Computacenter is a member, can through the combined buying power of
their membership overturn the food chain, controlling the manufacturers
rather than being controlled. If this happens, Mr Pinchbeck sees computer
manufacturers becoming very much like the suppliers of UK supermarkets,
having prices, terms and conditions dictated to them by a few all-powerful
chains. A possible escape-route, he feels, involves manufacturers learning
from the motor industry and moving machines tailored to individual
specification straight off the production line. The manufacturer, in effect,
would become a systems integrator.
Other manufacturers are however exploring different routes to survival. One
of the basic planks on which Compaq was founded was its determination not to
sell direct, but in recent years, as the power of its equipment has
increased, the company has found itself evolving what is in effect a direct
sales force that does not sell direct.
With the exception of the large chains, a company's individual dealers do
not have the resources to sell adequately into what is, in effect, the
minicomputer market. If a company will not set up the kind of direct sales
force traditionally used to sell minis, it finds itself forced to do an
increasing amount of hand holding for the dealers who are making the sales.
Compaq UK has in the past few years hired a number of staff from mini
manufacturers, and Mr Gian Carlo Bisone, head of European marketing, is no
stranger to these techniques.
The nature of the market accentuates these problems. Mr Bisone describes the
primary characteristic of the dealer channel as being that it has no money,
and Compaq pursues intricate schemes in order to inject money into it
without the extra cash disappearing in the shape of increased discounts to
customers.
Training and joint marketing programmes are examples of how this can be
done. Other manufacturers are engaged in heavy support programmes for their
dealer base, and one possible consequence of such approaches is that dealers
 -particularly those who are not part of large associations - will become
more closely bound to single manufacturers. These manufacturers may, albeit
accidentally, convert their dealer base into what is effectively a direct
sales force.
In the UK, Apple has traditionally taken a similar approach to Compaq,
attempting to keep prices and the level of its dealer expertise high, and
taking a highly combative line with discount houses. However, it has created
a problem for itself, in terms of sales channels, with its new low-cost
range of machines. There are rumours that the company will later this year
release a range aimed fair and square at the home/games market which
indicates that the problem can only get worse.
Selling these without overturning the applecart and forcing down prices on
its higher specification machines is a puzzle Apple is still working on. Mr
John Sculley, chief executive officer, has made confusing and perhaps
ominous references to rapid turnover-style outlets.
There is an alternative that Apple will almost certainly reject. If
manufacturers in general find themselves facing lower margins on the
machines they sell into distribution channels, is it not logical for them to
consider reducing the number of tiers in the channels, or perhaps eliminate
them completely by selling direct to users?
Speaking at a conference in Dusseldorf last month, Mr Billy Ho, Mitac
associate vice-president told the company's distributors that, at least for
machines that are priced at commodity level, the company would have to face
up to a reduction in the number of tiers in the channels.
Mitac, a Taiwanese company, is one of the largest computer manufacturers in
the world, although its name isn't that well known to users because it has
traditionally built for other computer companies. His view was that Mitac
distributors worldwide would have to begin to sell direct to users in order
to increase sales and maintain profitability, and if as seems likely other
manufacturers are thinking along similar lines, the future could hold
increased terrors for independent dealers.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (13): Consortia add to
confusion - Standards, users wait in vain for common technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPUTER industry is driven by fashion, and industry standards is the
current craze. At one time, indeed, it seemed as if a genuine enthusiasm for
common standards might result in lower costs and greater simplicity of
operations for customers, a notion much promoted by the manufacturers
themselves.
The belief was that if manufacturers were prepared to agree common
technologies for operating computers, connecting them together and running
software, users would be saved the cost and complexity of connecting
dissimilar hardware. At the same time, software suppliers would be able to
write programs capable of being run on any machine, cutting the cost of the
multiple versions they have to produce at present.
That, however, has proved a vain hope. For most computer users, the
standards issue has become hopelessly confused. The suppliers have done
little to help matters, taking part in seemingly endless series of industry
consortia to promote one standard or another. There are compelling financial
reasons for this apparent waywardness - backing the wrong standards horse
can be an expensive mistake. But somewhere along the line, the idea of
common standards to which everybody in the industry adheres for the benefit
of the customer has been lost.
Common standards are crucial to the idea of open systems, which most
observers believe will play an increasingly important part in data
processing over the next decade.
What is an open system? According a new handbook*, they are defined as:
'those that conform to internationally agreed standards defining computing
environments that allow users to develop, run and interconnect applications
and the hardware they run on, from whatever source, without significant
conversion cost'.
The author goes on to point out that the key factors for users are that no
single supplier actually 'owns' (that is, has control of) the environments
involved and that the mixing and matching of applications and hardware can
be achieved without significant cost.
The reality is that every supplier of any size is scrabbling to own, or at
least share ownership, of any hardware or software element which looks as if
it stands a fair chance of becoming a standard. The result has been a series
of pitched battles which show no real signs of abating.
Even the oldest standards war, the fight over how best to connect computers
together in telecommunications networks, has yet to be resolved after more
than 15 years.
On the one hand, standards setting bodies are trying to establish a set of
rules called Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) which they have now almost
completely defined. On the other hand, International Business Machines (IBM)
is insisting that its SNA rules will remain the way for its own machines to
be connected together, while many customers are content with rules called
TCP/IP devised by the US Defense Department.
Or consider, for example, the latest industry initiative, a consortium of 20
leading suppliers including the US companies Compaq, the leading supplier of
high performance personal computers, Control Data, the mainframe supplier
and Digital Equipment, the world's principal minicomputer maker. It also
includes the Japanese suppliers NEC, Nippon Kokan KK and Sony.
The consortium has established what it calls an Advanced Computing
Environment (Ace) whose elements include support for software operating
environments from Microsoft (OS/2 version 3.0) and the Santa Cruz Operation
(Open Desktop, a version of the Unix operating systems) and microprocessor
chips from Intel (80/386, 80/486 and so on) and MIPS Computer Systems'
(advanced reduced instruction set computing, or Risc) chips.
The aim of the group is to 'unify' the industry by establishing standards
combining software and hardware technologies from personal computers,
computer workstations and multi-processor computers.
The group does not include, however, IBM, the world's largest computer
manufacturer, which frequently seems to behave as if it feels it has an
inalienable right to decide which standards the industry will adopt. It is a
leading light behind the Open Software Foundation, which has been developing
its own Unix-like operating systems, OSF1.
Some observers see the formation of the Ace consortium as a challenge to
IBM; others as an attempt to displace Sun Microsystems from its dominant
position in the Unix workstation market place.
Sun, an ambitious, fast-growing company, has about two-thirds of the market
for Unix workstations based on its proprietary Risc design called 'sparc'.
It has been licensing this design widely in an aggressive attempt to
establish it as the industry Risc standard.
One of the first licensees was Solbourne, a workstation manufacturer. Mr
Barrie Murray-Upton, its vice-president of European operations, said after
the announcement of Ace: 'Why would 20 of the world's leading computer
manufacturers band together to form a consortium unless they were seriously
worried about the continuing success of sparc technology?'
The Ace group's attempt to appear cohesive was not helped, either, by the
emergence of a splinter group among the 20 declaring its support for yet
another version of Unix. The upshot of all this wrangling is that customers'
need for genuinely open systems has been hijacked and treated with contempt
by rival industry gangs.
Groups of users have attempted to establish their own ginger groups, but
with only limited success - General Motors' attempt to set a manufacturing
automation protocol (MAP) is one example.
Earlier this year, in initiative sponsored by the user arm of X/Open, one of
the earliest standards pressure groups,representing hundreds of users met in
Dallas, Texas, to formulate plans to encourage manufacturers to speed up the
introduction of open systems. They deliberated and drew up lists of their
requirements. The resolutions, however, fell far short of an ultimatum to
the manufacturers. Computer users, to some extent, have only themselves to
blame for the way manufacturers treat them.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (12): The high price of top
performance - Supercomputers, a faster rate of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER only 12 years service at the Aldermaston Atomic Weapons Establishment,
the world's first modern day supercomputer is already an antique.
The Cray 1A, the pioneering computer designed by Seymour Cray after he
founded Cray Research in the mid-1970s, has been consigned to a disused
aircraft hangar used by the London Science Museum to store exhibits. Donated
to the Museum by the Cray company, it will eventually be displayed as part
of the Computing Collection.
Weighing eight tonnes and operating at 160m floating point operations a
second (Flops), a measure of supercomputing performance, it cost Pounds 8m
in 1979. Now it is: 'Outdated, large and expensive for what it does by
modern standards' according to the Science Museum's Mr Peter Bailes. Today's
top of the range Cray, the YMP-8 with eight processors weighs considerably
less, operates at a peak of 2.5bn flops and costs about Dollars 20m.
The Cray 1A was designed to stand alone; Cray's newest machines are built
for what Mr John Rollwagen, the company's chief executive, calls 'network
supercomputing'; providing number crunching capability as part of a network
of smaller computers.
The rapid advances in technology which have so quickly dated the Cray 1A,
have also changed the shape of the supercomputer business.
Only a few years ago, there were two dominant manufacturers, Cray and
Control Data of the US, supplying a tiny group of customers who both needed
the power and could afford the price of the fastest available computing
hardware. Today, the same customers - meteorologists, oil exploration
organisations, aerospace companies and automobile manufacturers - still need
supercomputer performance.
Peugeot SA, for example, an organisation comprising the two French
automobile manufacturers Automobiles Peugeot and Automobiles Citroen, has
just ordered a Cray YMP2E, a two processor system that nevertheless delivers
some 600 mips. It will be used for general automobile research and design
including structural analysis, crash simulation, acoustic design and the
simulation of car behaviour.
The supercomputer landscape has changed irrevocably, however, over the past
two years. Control Data, the US supercomputing pioneer has moved out of the
area altogether, as commercial difficulties in other parts of its business
made the heavy research and development investment necessary to stay at the
leading edge too great a burden.
Seymour Cray detached himself from Cray Research to establish a new company
devoted to the development of the Cray 3, an innovative machine based on
chips fabricated in gallium arsenide, a material which makes possible speeds
of about three times the maximum possible from silicon.
The new machine depends on a whole range of new technologies including
assembly by robots and is proving a severe challenge even for a man
recognised as the world's foremost supercomputer designer.
International Business Machines, which for many years had tended to ignore
supercomputing as a niche market where the return hardly justified the
investment, changed its mind and came back to the market with a family of
vector processors - conventional high performance mainframes with a bolt-on
accessory giving a performance for certain applications close to that of a
supercomputer. It also funded research into an advanced supercomputer being
developed by Mr Steve Chen, formerly a senior designer with Cray Research.
The three Japanese mainframe manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC
launched supercomputers of impressive performance. While critics argue that
their machines are let down by inferior software when compared to the Cray
range, there can be little doubt that in hardware terms the Japanese
machines are set to challenge the best US designs
The principal change in the market, however, has been wrought by a different
kind of advance. The emergence of two new kinds of supercomputer -
minisupercomputers and massively parallel machines, which offer much of the
performance of a conventional supercomputer at a fraction of the cost - have
opened new markets for supercomputing. Supercomputers, in fact, is a name
not much to the liking of computer engineers who prefer the expression
'scientific computers'.
On this basis, a high performance Sun workstation carrying out scientific
and engineering calculations is in the foothills of supercomputer
performance. Speed is the important factor especially where, for example,
weather forecasting is involved. As Mr Bryan Little, director of operations
for Cray Research in Europe, points out, the calculations involved in
weather prediction can be carried out by a small machine - but by the time
the answer has been delivered, the storm will have passed.
Minisupercomputers have the capacity to tackle many kinds of calculation and
simulation. Some approach the speed of a full scale supercomputer. FPS
Computing, for example, which started out building 'go-faster' processors
has launched a machine which it rates at 2.1bn flops on typical mathematical
routines - close to the performance of a Dollars 20m Cray for less than
Dollars 2m.
The kinds of customer who can take advantage of minisupercomputing power
include scientists carrying out electromagnetic analysis, structural
analysis, signal processing and computational chemistry.
Typical of the new superminicomputer manufacturers is Convex Computer
Corporation, another company experimenting with esoteric gallium arsenide
technology to give speed at low cost.
Cray, faced with the first threat to its pre-eminence in supercomputing in
many years, has been forced to meet the challenge from Convex and other
minisupercomputer makers by launching smaller, air-cooled models in its YMP
series. It also bought a US-based minisupercomputer maker, Supertek
Computers, and now sells its S-1 machine.
Massively parallel machines are constructed by manufacturers such as
Thinking Machines of the US. These rely for their power on hundreds or
thousands of individual processing chips connected together and co-ordinated
by special software.
Where is Europe in all this? Nowhere in conventional supercomputing. It
does, however, have the skills to build massively parallel machines, using,
for example, the Inmos transputer, a processing chip designed for parallel
processing applications.
Edinburgh University, for example, is particularly advanced in
transputer-based supercomputing. But it will require funding on a
substantial scale for Europe to make much headway against the US and Japan.
In the latest in a long series of warnings that Europe is throwing away the
supercomputing future, the Italian physicist Mr Carlo Rubbia and a panel of
experts have urged the development of pan-European high speed computer
communications network backed by a Community expenditure by 1995 of 1bn Ecus
a year.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (10): Unsatisfactory term,
must try harder - The Schools, anxiety for the class of '91
</HEADLINE>

THE UK schools' computer business has been going through an unsatisfactory
term and there seems little prospect of improvement in the near future.
The two principal manufacturers in the sector, Acorn Computers of Cambridge
and Research Machines of Oxford, have been monitoring their sales figures
anxiously as the financial year draws to a close and are becoming convinced
that economic circumstances and legislative changes are conspiring to force
into decline a market which normally expands reliably if unspectacularly.
Mr Michael Fischer, chairman and chief executive of Research Machines, said
the sales bonanza which usually characterises the first three months of the
year had failed to materialise.
'It is pretty bad news for us,' he said, adding that the sales decline was
disappointing after the company's record results last year. Its turnover was
Pounds 63m with pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.25m.
Mr Sam Wauchope, managing director of Acorn Computers, said sales had been
uneven through the year.
He did not think there would be a first-quarter sales increase and overall
he believed total spending in schools would decline.
School computer sales normally surge in the first quarter of the year
because, with the end of the financial year in sight, special grants for
computer purchase, worth perhaps Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m, become available on
an ad hoc basis from the Department of Education and Science and the
Department of Trade and Industry.
In the current economic climate, however, suppliers are not optimistic that
money will be available from these sources this year.
Schools and local education authorities have traditionally raced to spend
their financial allocations by the end of the financial year with the result
that money from a variety of budgets becomes available for computers.
This year, suppliers believe that schools are storing cash away against a
bleak economic outlook. The evidence is that they are deferring decisions to
buy more computers.
While exact numbers have yet to be collated following the end of the
government's financial year this month, it seems likely that a market that
was expected to grow by 10 per cent will contract by the same amount, an
overall decline of some 20 per cent.
This bad news comes at the end of 12 months of unsettling volatility in what
is normally a predictable market.
The spread of local management of schools (LMS), which by 1993 will ensure
that all schools in England and Wales with more than 200 pupils will control
their own budgets, has resulted in confusion and uncertainty among those
newly responsible for, but unused to, taking decisions about computer
hardware and software. In the past, they have relied heavily on advice from
local education authority advisers. Some will continue to do so.
Also, difficulties local authorities are experiencing in administering the
poll tax has added an element of uncertainty to the value of capitation
grants they will make to schools.
School computing is not big business - the whole UK educational computer
market including colleges, polytechnics and universities is worth less than
Pounds 200m.
It is, however, a niche market par excellence in the computing business and
those companies which have made it their own have enjoyed steady returns in
recent years.
The principal players, Acorn and Research Machines, derive their strength
from the intimate relationship they have built up with their customers,
their understanding of the educational process and their willingness to
provide extensive service for modest returns.
Large suppliers like IBM and Apple, while strong in the universities and
colleges, have little part in school computing and are unlikely to make
inroads.
School computing is two markets in one - the market for educational
computing and the market for educational administration. Research Machines
and Acorn, with a wealth of ready-written, high quality educational software
have cornered the market for educational computing in schools. They are less
dominant in educational administration where there is more of a need for
conventional computer power.
Acorn, part of the Italian Olivetti group which developed the BBC
microcomputer, has dominated the schools market since the early 1980s.
Acorn systems are installed in 85 per cent of schools. It is especially
strong in the primary sector where it boasts familiarity and an impressive
range of educational software, with more than 1,000 programs listed in the
Acorn Education Directory.
Company's latest machines feature a high-performance microprocessor of its
own design which has persuaded Apple Computer of the US to establish a joint
company with VLSI Technology and Acorn to exploit the technology.
About half Acorn's revenues of about Pounds 50m come from sales to schools.
Research Machines of Oxford, privately held, is second overall to Acorn, but
holds 44 per cent of the market in secondary schools and 29 per cent in
colleges.
About 60 per cent of its sales of Pounds 63m are to schools and it has a
strong toehold in government computing and computer-aided design.
Research Machines competes in both the computers for education and computers
for administration sectors. Recently it won a Pounds 4m order to provide
every secondary school in Northern Ireland with the hardware and software
for LMS.
While the combined effects of LMS, the economy and the poll tax on computer
sales are depressing for the companies involved, they also raise questions
about the preparedness of schools to teach the national curriculum.
A recent study by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology - the
independent body that reports to parliament on the scientific and
technological implications of big issues such as food irradiation and the
greenhouse effect - suggested that schools in England and Wales would need
Pounds 310m during the next five years to deliver the computer education
required by the curriculum.
It is worrying that that sum is unlikely to be made available. It is equally
worrying that nobody seems sure of how much money schools will be prepared
to spend on computers in the next few years.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (9): The shift to open
systems unlocks sector - Europe, a crisis that knows no national boundaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of stunningly defensive, whole-page advertisements from Groupe Bull
in Europe's leading newspapers last month highlights the crisis facing the
entire European-owned computer industry. They were used to soften the impact
of the announcement of Bull's FFr6.8bn (Dollars 1.19bn) loss in 1990.
Most of the leading players are trading at a loss. Those, such as Olivetti,
that are still keeping their heads above red ink, are showing greatly
reduced profitability. The crisis knows no national boundaries.
Germany: Siemens-Nixdorf chief executive Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig warned last
month that Europe's largest computer company, formed in 1990 from the ailing
Nixdorf Computers and Siemens' computer interests, would not make profits
this year as he had hoped, nor was he prepared to say when it would become
profitable. The difficulties of assimilating Nixdorf, which had losses of
about Dollars 636m in its last year as an independent company, have proved
far greater than expected.
Comparex, a joint venture between BASF and Siemens selling chiefly
mainframes built by Hitachi of Japan, on the other hand, made post-tax
profits of DM42m, 31 per cent up on the previous year.
France: state-owned Bull's loss is thought to be a record for the industry
in any one year. It is made up of a FFr3bn operating loss and restructuring
charges of about FFr3.8bn. The company is already well advanced with an
ambitious programme of corporate changes designed to restore competitiveness
and vitality. It includes cutting the number of manufacturing plants from 13
to five, reducing staff by some 5,000 over the year and rationalising
research and development and marketing.
Italy: Olivetti has remained consistently in the black, but its
profitability has been falling. Its 1990 turnover is not expected to show
much advance on the L9.031bn recorded in 1989 and its profits are expected
much below the L202.8bn announced that year. It is in the process of
trimming 7,000 jobs from the workforce; manufacturing activities are being
rationalised both in Italy and the rest of the world as are direct and
indirect distribution networks.
The Netherlands: Philips is shedding some 50,000 staff worldwide; the
resulting restructuring charges forced a loss of Fl 4.2bn last year; the
root cause, however, was heavy losses in the information systems division.
Now Philips is moving away from computer systems of its own design to those
built to industry standards.
The UK: International Computers, Britain's largest information technology
company, while still generating good profits, was bought from STC by Fujitsu
last year, leaving the telecommunications company free to concentrate on its
core interests.
The deal with Fujitsu came at the end of a series of abortive merger
discussions between ICL and several other European-owned computer companies.
Apricot Computers, manufacturing arm of the Apricot Group was sold to
Mitsubishi Electric of Japan last year.
In a surprising reversal of fortune, both ICL and Apricot are now selling
UK-designed and manufactured computers in Japan. Smaller manufacturers have
been affected by the same malaise.
Norsk Data of Norway and Nokia Data of Finland are going through extensive
restructuring and job losses in their attempts to return to profitability.
The plight of Europe computer makers is, to some extent, a reflection of the
troubles afflicting every large computer manufacturer worldwide.
Customers, especially governments and the armed forces, are beginning to
move rapidly from traditional, mainframe-based data processing systems to
so-called 'client server systems' where the computing power is supplied by
small computers and workstations networked together.
There is growing demand for computers which can easily be connected into
client server networks regardless of the manufacturer of origin. Industry
standard or open systems are becoming preferred to proprietary designs.
The shift in preference from proprietary designs to open systems took place
with remarkable suddenness. It coincided with a rapid, but temporary,
softening in many of the European markets. Companies such as Nixdorf which
had been gearing up on the back of powerful sales of their proprietary
systems suddenly found themselves facing weak markets with systems which
were no longer in fashion.
Europe will remain an important IT market though the US will remain
dominant. According to figures from the consultancy Price Waterhouse, the
world IT market was worth Dollars 212bn in 1984; the US held 55 per cent,
Europe 25 per cent, Japan 10 per cent with a similar percentage for the rest
of the world.
By 1992, according to Price Waterhouse, the overall value of the market will
have grown to Dollars 649bn.
The US share will have shrunk to 44 per cent, the European share will have
grown to 31.5 per cent with Japan and the rest of the world holding 14 per
cent and 10.5 per cent respectively.
It seems likely that US and Japanese manufacturers will profit from the
growth in the European market, however, rather than the local champions.
There are sharply opposed views on what, if anything, should be done to
support European-owned companies. The French government which owns over 70
per cent of Groupe Bull has agreed to support its restructuring measures,
but it understands that the company has to find a partner to share the load.
There have been talks between Europe's main players aimed at establishing a
single transnational computer company able to rationalise research and
development costs and achieve continent-wide economies of scale, but they
have all foundered on issue of management and control.
Some, looking at the example of Unisys of the US, question whether putting
together failing companies is anything more than a recipe for further
failure.
The European commission recently published a fiercely-debated plan to make
the electronics industry more competitive based on training, standards,
bilateral agreements and collaborative research and development projects. No
new money would be involved.
In doing so, it has moved to more of a hands-off approach to encouraging
competitiveness than earlier and unsuccessful interventionist strategies.
The fate of ICL within the Fujitsu organisation is being watched closely as
an example of the most extreme form of survival measure. It may not be too
long before others are forced to follow suit.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (8): Windows to rooms -
Graphical User Interfaces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYSTEMS for managing large amounts of information are becoming increasingly
important to business computer-users. For example, the concept of
overlapping 'windows' on computer screens has become popular since its
introduction a decade ago.
In the US, the Xerox research centre at Palo Alto unveiled graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) 10 years ago to replace command-driven interfaces which
tend to restrict the working area of computer screens with control codes.
The easier-to-use window-driven GUIs enable various sources of information
and tools to be worked on in separate windows for a single project.
When numerous projects are under way, it can be difficult and time-consuming
to shuffle round a clutter of overlapping windows. Now Xerox has developed
the 'Rooms' concept which takes the graphical user interface into a wholly
new dimension.
The system puts all the windows that are relevant for a single task into a
separate information workspace (or room), with linking electronic doors that
allow users to work on many projects at the same time. The system also
allows users to collaborate with different sets of people for each project.
Xerox's graphical user interface has always been object-orientated - unlike
many of today's icon-driven interfaces - and is based around a concept of an
electronic desktop. The rooms concept is based on research by cognitive
psychologists and computer scientists at the Xerox PARC research centre.
'The system is based on the idea that personal computers are fine in their
place, but what many workers and planners need to get projects under way is
a large table - a place to spread out files and papers for easy access,'
explains Mr Chris Lindesay, integrated systems manager at Rank Xerox.
The new system allows users to co-ordinate desktops: 'With rooms, all you do
is walk into your specific project office and you find it just as you last
left it, with all your information close at hand,' says Mr Lindesay
The concept, which is now at the advanced development stage, allows users to
create a suite of rooms which can passed around, copied to disk or loaded on
to other workstations. To assist users, an overview room is provided where
users can see the layout of rooms on a single screen.
The system, which Xerox is demonstrating at this years Which Computer? Show,
supports the natural way people work, 'rather than forcing them to change
what they do to suit the limitations imposed by screen-sizes and windowing
systems,' says Mr Lindesay.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (7): Advancing on many
fronts - Japan, plans to build on its supremacy in laptop sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S computer makers are betting that the next generation of computer
users will fall into their laps - literally.
Japanese manufacturers believe their increasing supremacy in the production
and sale of laptop computers will lead to a significant expansion of Japan's
role in the overall computer market.
Japan's consumer electronics companies control half of the laptop and
notebook market, the industry's fastest growing segment. And Japanese
dominance of such critical technologies as disk drives and
liquid-crystal-displays (LCDs), together with Japanese skill at shrinking
components, has led such US stalwarts as IBM and Apple into joint ventures
with their Japanese competitors.
While laptops account for 13 per cent and 20 per cent of the European and US
PC market respectively, they account for almost half of all PCs sold in
Japan. Many analysts believe the European and US figures will double within
three years.
Japanese miniaturisation techniques are sure to help them lead the emerging
palmtop and tablet markets. Japanese companies are increasingly dominant in
disk drives, not only at the low end with hard drives for PCs, but at the
high end for mainframes.
The Japanese have worked hard to improve their software and service in
Japan, and hope to begin exporting such skills in the near future. Even with
their relatively limited presence in the computer-systems and software
market, Japanese manufacturers exported over Dollars 20bn-worth of
computer-related products last year, some 85 per cent of which were in parts
and peripherals.
Japanese makers are increasing their control of high density storage systems
as companies such as Epson and NEC continue to gain share at the expense of
small and medium-size US makers. Japanese companies are certain to widen
their dominant lead in display technologies, including those related to high
definition television (HDTV).
Sharp, Epson, and NEC have clearly established themselves as the world's
leaders in LCD technology. South Korea and Taiwan, their closest
competitors, are years behind, while US makers are virtually non-existent.
Such technologies are growing in importance as HDTV-related systems are used
in a widening variety of applications, including workstations which are
still dominated by US companies.
'There's no use in having a Rolls-Royce engine if you have a poor monitor,'
says Mr Barry Dargan, an analyst at James Capel Pacific in Tokyo.
Japanese producers are forging ahead in other areas, including taking
industry leader IBM head-on in mainframes. Japanese producers including NEC,
Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Toshiba believe their growing presence in PCs will
propel them into complete systems integration, particularly as the mainframe
market matures relative to PCs.
NEC boasts the fastest supercomputer in the world, the SX-3. Japanese
service networks continue to trail their US competitors, notably IBM.
However, Toshiba and NEC continue to improve their growing sales channels in
the US, while Fujitsu's purchase of ICL has catapulted Japan's largest
mainframe maker into the forefront of European sales and distribution
network channels.
Although the Japanese still trail in the development of software for export,
Japanese companies have become highly skilled at designing operating
software systems for the Japanese market. Hitachi and Fujitsu, in
particular, have devoted significant resources to the development of
world-class software.
Such investments will pay off in the future, particularly as the world moves
in the direction of more open industry standards such as Unix, the operating
system developed by A T &amp; T which seems destined to become a world standard
for small computers.
In the end, Japanese computer makers greatest strength may be the growing
dominance of other Japanese industrial sectors. As Japanese industries such
as automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and steel continue to expand and automate,
they are sure to bring Japanese computer makers along with them.
'It's much tougher (for Japanese computer makers) to sell to GM than to
Toyota or Nissan,' says Mr Steven Myers, an analyst at Jardine Fleming in
Tokyo. Given that PC use in Japanese offices is one half that of Europe and
one quarter that in the US, Japan's internal market is poised for a period
of explosive growth.
Japan's estimated Y7,000bn information technology market is the world's
second largest, and is expected to more than double by the end of the
decade. Most of the increase in sales will fall to Japanese makers. Japanese
companies will continue to prefer to grow internally. However, more
companies may resort to either taking equity positions or outright
acquisitions in fields in which Japanese companies trail, such as processing
technologies and software.
'The Japanese have to catch up in some areas and they know it,' says Mr
Dargan. 'If they can't do it themselves, they'll engage in joint ventures or
acquisitions.' Joint ventures such as NMB-Intel are bound to increase as
capital-starved US companies increasingly turn to their deep-pocketed
Japanese competitors.
'Small West Coast tech houses are vulnerable to being cherry-picked,' says
Mr Dargan, pointing to TDK's Dollars 200m acquisition of Silicon Systems in
1989.
Still, Japan's dearth of software programmers - estimated at 600,000 - is
expected to top 1m by the end of the century. Such a shortfall, argue most
analysts, can only partially be made up by subcontracting work to Korea and
China and by buying small US producers. But Japanese computer makers remain
undaunted. If anything, the only impediments most Japanese companies see in
the way of their inevitable advance are political.
Fujitsu, for one, has been extremely wary of a political backlash in Europe
following its purchase of ICL and its exclusion from three of the five
European research consortia to which ICL belonged. Consequently, Japanese
makers will continue the less risky strategy of supplying European makers on
an OEM basis.
'Japanese manufacturers realise they just can't take market share through
competition alone,' says Mr Dargan. Japanese companies are diffusing
proprietary technologies in south-east Asia as the Newly Industrialized
Economies (NIEs) repeat Japan's previous policy of insisting on technology
transfer in return for access to their markets.
US companies, burned by their liberal sharing of technology with Japanese
companies in the past, are trying to demand a more equitable sharing of
know-how.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (6): Patient expansion
continues - The Japanese in Europe, a preference for joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TOMKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE European information technology companies continue to experience
difficulties, their Japanese counterparts are patiently expanding their
presence on the Continent and in the UK.
Although Fujitsu's acquisition last year of ICL garnered the most headlines,
scores of Japanese companies are developing production facilities, creating
sales networks and searching for potential joint venture partners in the
region.
'We very much respect the marketing and software capabilities of European
firms, especially their network architecture,' says Mr Hideichi Nose,
vice-president for European operations at NEC.
Most observers believe that except for sales channels and some software,
most European companies have little to offer their Japanese rivals besides
political cover.
'European information technology companies rank very low on the list of who
the Japanese fear,' says Mr David Benda, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd (Asia) in Tokyo.
'The Japanese want to have a presence in Europe. But what can they get by
acquiring a company? Not much, except for distribution,' he adds.
Japanese companies prefer to stay away from high-profile acquisitions, even
friendly ones such as ICL. Instead, most are concentrating on establishing
their own production and sales networks, preferably in the form of joint
ventures.
'We have to be certain that investments in fields like semiconductors are
welcome,' says Mr Taizo Nishimuro, general manager for overseas operations
at Toshiba. 'It might be easier to go it 100 per cent alone or to buy out an
existing firm, but it doesn't guarantee us that those actions will be
welcomed by the community.'
Most observers believe Toshiba will not be alone in co-operating with its
European competitors. Olivetti may be forced to strengthen ties with various
Japanese companies, including Hitachi which provides it with hardware on an
OEM basis. Siemens sells Fujitsu mainframes and supercomputers, licenses
Drams from Toshiba, and given its distribution and service networks, is a
natural match for a Japanese partner.
Meanwhile, Bull's increasing problems may force it to fully embrace NEC,
which now provides the French company with mainframes. 'Bull has to figure
out what it's going to cut, what it's going to keep, and what it's going to
source out,' says Mr Steve Myers, analyst at Jardine Fleming (Securities) in
Tokyo. 'It's entirely conceivable, but not certain, that Bull will become
dependent on NEC hardware and choose to add value through software,' he
says.
Such arrangements - Japanese hardware and customised local software - are
expected to increase as more production becomes application specific.
Fujitsu has formed joint ventures with Quotient of the UK and the British
subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas, to develop software for the banking and
CAD/CAM industries respectively.
Toshiba is developing CMOS chips with SGS Thomson Microelectronics of
Holland, while other Japanese producers are sourcing out much of their local
software and design work. Moreover, even with higher capital costs and
mounting overcapacity in the memory chip market, Japanese companies have not
abandoned direct investment. NEC plans to begin construction of a new
computer production facility in Germany and has just completed upgrading its
plant in Scotland to produce four megabit Drams.
Fujitsu will soon finish a new production facility in Durham in northern
England to produce similar chips.
'Investment has slowed,' admits Mr Mike Jeremy, an analyst at Baring
Securities (Japan). 'But not as much as had been expected.'
Many analysts argue that one of the attractions of western Europe is its
position as a springboard for eastern European market. Over 60 per cent of
Japanese products sold in eastern Europe are shipped from Japanese
subsidiaries in the EC.
'Naturally, because of its proximity and its similar culture we do feel
entering eastern Europe is easier through the west, especially Germany,'
says Mr Nishimuro. As personal incomes grow in the former Comecon states,
the market will shift from large-scale infrastructure projects (a relative
European strength) to consumer-driven purchases sure to favour the Japanese,
say most analysts.
Moreover, some Japanese companies are attracted by the East's low wages and
relatively well-educated workforce. Such allures may lead many Japanese
companies to shift much of their assembly operations to the east, and to
concentrate on more value-added production in the West.
'To the extent you put semiconductor production into western Europe, board
stuffing can then be done where it's cheapest,' says Mr Myers.
Political uncertainties remain the greatest fear among senior executives in
Tokyo. Fujitsu, in particular, is wary of projecting a high-profile image.
'ICL is a different company,' says Mr Yuri Momomoto, of Fujitsu. 'They have
their own plans which we don't know about.' Regardless, except for political
sensitivities, and perhaps being privy to the setting of standards, most
Japanese companies seem unconcerned with being shut out of European research
consortia, largely because Japanese companies have much more to contribute
than the Europeans themselves.
'It doesn't make sense to keep out the Japanese,' says Mr Jeremy. 'The
Europeans will lose the opportunity to monitor them. It's a two-way street.
It's no more Machiavellian than that.'
In addition, many argue that dictates from Brussels may ultimately backfire.
A 1990 decision by the European Commission setting minimum prices for
Japanese chips allegedly being dumped in Europe may help Japanese producers
beset by falling prices in the same way a similar 1985 US decree (now
expired) rescued a Japanese chip industry drowning in its own overcapacity.
Moreover, adds Mr Benda, as Europe continues to insist that more products be
manufactured locally, more Japanese companies will come, posing a further
threat to European companies. Others argue, however, that even if Japanese
companies were to show that they are 'politically correct' by participating
in projects such as the research consortia, it is doubtful that they would
be willing to share any of their most advanced technology - something they
have never done in the past.
'There must be another mechanism by which the Japanese are forced to share
some of their technology,' says a Tokyo-based industry observer. 'If the
Europeans don't band together and try to do something then they may as well
throw in the towel.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (5): New generation
challenges leaders - The view from the US, Louise Kehoe in San Francisco
assesses changing market strategies and unveils a palmtop

THE US computer industry is in the midst of a broad restructuring driven by
technology advances that have changed the economics of computer
manufacturing.
Some of the largest companies in the industry are being forced to make
painful adjustments, while a new generation of computer makers is growing
rapidly. Making these changes more difficult for all computer companies are
the triple troubles of a recessionary domestic economy, European economic
ills and the interruption of normal purchasing patterns created by the Gulf
War.
The effects of these problems are being keenly felt by many US computer
companies, creating an industry downturn in which revenue growth has been
stalled and earnings are expected to decline in the short term. While these
economic problems are expected to be short lived, the fundamental changes
under way in computer technology could reshape the industry in the 1990s,
analysts predict.
The most important technology trend is the rising power of the
microprocessor - the 'computer on a chip'. The initial impact of the
microprocessor was to create the personal computer, spawning a new
generation of computer companies in the 1980s such as Apple Computer, which
has annual revenues of Dollars 5.5bn, and Compaq Computer with Dollars
3.6bn.
Networking technology, which enables large numbers of PCs to be tied
together so that they can share data, transformed the PC from a stand-alone
single user machine into an important element of office automation systems.
The PC has had a large impact upon the way computers are used in offices.
They have greatly expanded the use of desktop computers and to a significant
extent displaced the minicomputer and computer terminals as standard office
automation equipment. The computer workstation, also based upon
microprocessors, has had a similar impact upon the technical computing
field.
Engineering workstations running computer-aided design programs, for
example, have usurped the role of mid-range computers in thousands of
laboratories and product development departments. Sun Microsystems, the
workstation market leader, has established a Dollars 2.5bn market for
high-powered desktop computers based upon Reduced Instruction Set Computing
(RISC) microprocessors, largely at the expense of traditional computer
companies such as Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard.
However, the inroads of the microprocessor have just begun. High-powered
computer systems that rival the system performance of mainframes and
minicomputers are being built using multiple microprocessors. Companies such
as Sequent Computer can offer mainframe-class computers built around Intel
microprocessors at a fraction of the cost of IBM mainframes.
Stratus Computer Systems is challenging IBM and Tandem Computers in the
market for fault tolerant computers for mission critical applications using
computers built around Motorola and MIPS Computers microprocessors. This
phenomenon, known as downsizing, has had an impact on the entire computer
industry.
'The microprocessor has turned hardware computer economics upside down,'
says Mr Steven Milunovich of Solomon Brothers, in a recent report on the
discontinuities in the computer industry. 'Multiprocessor systems will
directly threaten mainframe and minicomputer solutions,' he says.
'Relational data bases can transform data into information. Object-oriented
programming will reduce the applications backlogs that plague every level of
computing. And sophisticated networks will allow users to access data
seamlessly across the enterprise. Those vendors that can bridge these
discontinuities to aid customers in adopting new technologies, while
protecting prior investments, will benefit the most,' he says. However,
hardware is only one side of the computer industry. Software and services
are growing faster and have higher profit margins.
Companies such as Electronic Data Systems are riding the wave of the
computer services rise, providing computer users with solutions to their
increasingly complex information technology needs.
Another driving force behind the reshaping of the computer industry is the
trend toward open-systems standards that enable different types and brands
of computers to work more efficiently together. With majority of computer
companies are pursuing open systems, with varying degrees of enthusiasm.
For many, open systems represent an opportunity to infiltrate the customer
bases of industry leaders such as IBM and Digital Equipment, HP and Unisys.
The industry leaders have adopted open systems in part as a defensive move.
They view open systems as a means of providing customers with complete
solutions to their computing needs.
One of the critical needs of the 1990s among computer users, is to find a
way to tie together their inventories of computers, which have typically
been acquired in a rather haphazard fashion.
During the 1980s, distributed computing was in vogue. Departments of large
corporations frequently installed their own computer networks or systems
often with little reference to the corporate data processing centre. Now,
companies are trying to tie these computers together to create
enterprise-wide networks.
Enthusiasm for open systems and the trend toward lower-cost computer power
leads some to conclude that the large US computer hardware companies are
dinosaurs. This is to ignore several factors. While the mainframe computer
is challenged by new technologies, it remains a dominant sector of the
computer industry providing, for example, about half of IBM's Dollars 69bn
annual revenues.
Open systems, based upon the Unix operating system, are certainly becoming
more popular, but they represent only 12 per cent of annual computer sales.
The ability of established industry leaders to adjust to rapid changes in
the computer industry is frequently brought into question, but IBM is
turning itself slowly but surely to address the issues of the computer
market head on.
IBM is focusing upon solution selling, reorganising its business units to
more directly address the problems of its customers. Perhaps the best
measure of IBM's success comes from the large systems integrators, who
regard IBM as a direct competitor.
IBM has long been the market leader in the PC sector, which it quickly
recognised as a big new market opportunity in the early 1980s. In the
computer workstation market, IBM has made a late, but remarkably successful
entry. Last year, the company sold Dollars 1bn-worth of its RS/60000
workstations, leaping from nowhere to become the fifth largest workstation
supplier. This year, IBM is expected to climb to number two or three in the
workstation market and by 1993 will be neck and neck with Sun Microsystems,
the market leader, according to industry analysts.
Digital Equipment is undergoing a painful metamorphosis. After suffering a
period of internal strife between supporters of open systems and
traditionalists, Digital is putting together a coherent strategy. Digital
maintains that open systems must incorporate proprietary software if the
promise of the open systems movement - inter-operability among dissimilar
computers - is to be fulfilled.
Standard proprietary systems which adhere to standards that allow
inter-operability, represent the way of the future, many in the industry
believe. Computers such as Digital's VAX would retain their distinct
features, but acquire the ability to work with other types or brands of
computers. HP, the third largest US computer company, has overhauled its
computer product line to take advantage of microprocessor power and to
respond to the open systems trend.
Similarly, NCR and Data General have developed aggressive open systems
strategies. Unisys, in spite of financial woes, is pursuing open systems. It
is too soon to count out the US computer industry leaders of the 1970s, but
it seems certain that they will be forced to concede a bigger share of the
market to the companies that emerged in the 1980s.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (4): Palmtop has the punch
of a PC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HEWLETT-PACKARD'S palmtop computer, introduced today, is the size of a
cheque book and weighs just 11 ounces but the HP 95LX packs all of the punch
of an IBM-compatible personal computer.
Built into the HP pocket-sized computer is Lotus 1-2-3, the most popular
spreadsheet program.
In addition, a phone book and appointments calendar comes installed into the
HP palmtop. Further programs can be loaded by inserting solid-state memory
cards. A plug-in demodulator unit enables the HP 95LX to receive text
messages from cellular paging systems.
It is aimed at technical and scientific users of its desktop PCs, and offers
the power of a machine 10 times its size.

the trend; Mobile Computers - The view from the US, Louise Kehoe in San

SINCE the early 1980s, when the desktop personal computer was still in its
infancy, there have been numerous attempts to create 'portable' versions of
PCs. Only recently, however, have semiconductor, data storage and display
technology advanced to the point where a fully-functional PC can be packaged
in a compact, lightweight, carry-along unit.
These technology advances are creating an increase in sales of laptop,
notebook and pocket computers, with world-wide sales expected to top Dollars
8bn this year.
The market for mobile computers has become one of the fastest growing
sectors of the computer business. The increase in mobile computer sales
comes as sales of desktop personal computers are beginning to sag,
particularly in the US.
By the mid-1990s, portable computers will represent close to 50 per cent of
all types of PCs sold, market analysts predict. In Japan, laptop computers
account for over 40 per cent of all PC sales. In Tokyo's crowded offices the
smaller laptop computers are widely used on the desktop.
Europe is also caught up in the mobile computer revolution with unit sales
expected to rise by over 30 per cent this year. Spurring much of this growth
is the new category of notebook computers - battery-powered machines that
are small enough to fit in a briefcase and weigh 8 lbs or less.
More than 840,000 notebook computers were sold in the US in 1990, according
to International Data, a research company. It predicts that sales could rise
to 1.4m units in 1991 and rise to 6.2m by the middle of the decade.
The US portable computer market has so far been dominated by Compaq Computer
and Tandy of the US, the Zenith DataSystems division of France's Groupe
Bull, and Japanese makers Toshiba and NEC.
However, over the past year, as many as 40 computer companies have announced
new portable computers.
Many have yet to deliver these products with delays blamed on shortages of
displays, disk-drives and microprocessors. Also entering the portable
computer fray are some of the largest US and European computer
manufacturers.
International Business Machines recently unveiled its notebook computer in
its third attempt to find a place in the portable computer market. The IBM
Personal System/2 L40 SX notebook computer is slightly larger and heavier
than most products in this category, but it is designed to provide the full
functionality of the current generation of desktop computers, whereas many
notebook computers compromise performance to achieve lower weight and price.
The IBM notebook features a full-size keyboard virtually identical to that
found on IBM's PS/2 desktop PCs; a standard memory of two megabytes and
maximum memory of 18 MB; a 60 MB hard drive and a 10-inch Video Graphics
Array (VGA) display. All this comes in a 7.7 lb package priced in the US at
Dollars 6,000.
The recent entry of IBM into the notebook computer market, and the
anticipated announcement by Apple Computer this year of notebook-sized
versions of its Macintosh computers are expected to expand sales rather than
to unseat established suppliers.
Digital Equipment, Unisys, NCR and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph are
expected to launch mobile computer products this year. Portability still
comes at a premium price, with most mobile computers up to 50 per cent more
than equivalent desktop machines. Competition is spurring price cuts with
some companies such as AST Research offering substantially lower prices on
notebook computers.
Technology advances are significantly expanding the capabilities of portable
computers.
Flat panel colour displays have recently been introduced by Toshiba and
other leading portable makers.
The portable computer of the future will incorporate 'wireless
communications' according to many industry experts. Last month, NEC of Japan
introduced one of the first portable computers with wireless communications.
The 6.6 lb laptop computer incorporates a radio transceiver which enables it
to send and receive messages without a phone line.
NEC is offering the wireless computer only in Japan. Leading US computer
makers also see radio communications becoming an important feature of
portable computers in the future.
Apple recently filed a petition with the US Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) that, if approved, would let computers transmit and receive
information over radio waves instead of through a wired network.
For today's users of portable computers, wireless communications represent a
potential solution to the difficulties of hooking portable computers up to
telephones. While desktop personal computers that incorporate a model
generally have their own phone line, the portable computer must be plugged
into a phone in whatever location the user finds himself.
Yet to be resolved is one of the toughest technical challenges of building
portable computers - short battery life. Although power-management systems
and low-power components have significantly extended computer battery life,
battery technology is advancing only slowly, computer makers complain.
A new category of PCs that is beginning to show promise is the hand-held or
pocket computer. This market has been pioneered by Poqet Computer of
Sunnyvale, California, whose 1.1 lb IBM-compatible PC fits easily into a
coat pocket or handbag. The Poqet has been picked up by Infonet, the
international value-added network provider, as a portable communications
terminal, for sending and receiving electronic mail and other types of
messages.
Mr Stav Prodromou, founder and vice-chairman of Poqet, sees pocket-sized
computers creating new types of PC applications. These tiny computers are so
unobtrusive, he suggests, that they could be used to take notes during a
meeting. Their light weight also makes them suitable for use as an
electronic appointments calendar or time organiser.
Also about to enter the hand-held computer market is Hewlett-Packard, which
this month will introduce a calculator-sized unit with a built-in version of
the popular Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.
On the horizon is yet another new type of portable computers known as slate
computers. These notebook-sized devices will replace the familiar keyboard
with an electronic pen. The user will simply write on the 'slate' or point
to icons to select functions.
Numerous applications are envisaged for these pen-based computers among
people who do much of their work while standing or moving around. Doctors
and nurses might use them to update patients' notes or order tests, for
example.
Software that enables the computer to interpret hand-written notes has been
developed by Go Corporation, a California start-up. Microsoft, the leading
supplier of PC software, is also developing handwriting recognition software
that could be used as an extension of its existing PC operating systems.
Grid Systems, one of the pioneers of the portable computer market, offers a
slate computer with limited handwriting recognition capabilities. IBM and
Apple Computer have both expressed great interest in the potential for this
new technology. Market researchers at BIS Strategic Decisions predict that
sales of slate computers will top Dollars 1.5bn by 1995 and could become a
Dollars 7bn market by the end of the decade.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (2): Technology advance
drives sales growth; On-Line Transaction Processing - The view from the US,
Louise Kehoe in San Francisco assesses changing market strategies and
unveils a palmtop

ON-LINE transaction processing has grown to encompass a full third of world
computer market since its beginnings in airline reservation systems and
banking.
These interactive computer systems serve in a growing range of business
applications, from production management to customer service. With sales
last year of approximately Dollars 40bn worldwide, OLTP is growing at an
annual rate of about 20 per cent and will be a Dollars 72bn market by 1994,
according to market analysts.
Growth in the OLTP market is being driven by its broadening use in
telecommunications, manufacturing and retail industries, which have become
big users of OLTP. Technology advances in parallel processing and
microprocessor performance have downsized OLTP, creating applications and
making this mode of computing available to small and medium-sized businesses
as well as large corporations.
OLTP has been impacted by the trend toward open systems based upon the Unix
operating system. Unix-based OLTP will grow to between Dollars 18bn and
Dollars 21bn by 1994, according to Dataquest, the market research company.
The emergence of relational database management systems software has been a
driving force in the growth of OLTP. These programs, which enable users to
access information wherever it resides in a database, have become the basis
for a broad range of business applications running on OLTP systems.
'Fault tolerant', or 'high availability' computers represent an important
segment of the OLTP market. As businesses entrust their most critical
functions to computer systems, the reliability of the systems and their
ability to continue functioning through power failures, component failures,
software updates and all manner of events that can bring the average
computer to its knees has become vital.
Traditionally, OLTP systems have been based upon mainframe computers with
International Business Machines claiming the lion's share of the market. IBM
holds an estimated 55 per cent share of the OLTP market, largely based upon
its dominant role in mainframe computers. While IBM is expected to remain
the market leader, its share of the OLTP market will decline, according to
industry analysts, as microprocessor-based parallel processing systems -
many of them running the Unix operating system - displace traditional
mainframes.
Tandem Computers, pioneered the 'fault tolerant' computer market selling its
proprietary computers to banks and securities companies. Lower spending in
the financial services industries have hurt Tandem's earnings over the past
year but with 1990 revenues of Dollars 506.1bn the company remains the
market leader in fault-tolerant computers.
Last year, Tandem introduced its first open systems products, offering a
range of Unix computers based upon Mips Computers Reduced Instruction Set
Computer (RISC) chips. In addition to selling its Unix computers direct to
end users, Tandem signed an agreement with A T &amp; T under which the
telecommunications and computing company will resell the Tandem products.
Biting at the heels of IBM and Tandem are a new generation of specialist
OLTP computer companies led by Stratus Computer, Sequent Computer Systems
and Pyramid Technology. Stratus specialises in what it terms 'critical
on-line computing' or high availability computing for mission critical
applications.
Stratus's stronghold is in the financial services industry where it provides
systems for stock trading, automatic teller networks and credit card
authorisation. Stratus is, however, expanding its customer base in other
fields such as retailing, manufacturing and telecommunications.
Stratus recently launched a new product line based upon Intel's 860 Reduced
Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor, following a trend toward
the use of high performance RISC processors in OLTP. The company is also
making a transition from a proprietary operating system to open systems
based upon the Unix operating system.
Some 20 per cent of Stratus's Dollars 404m 1990 revenues came via IBM, which
sells Stratus computers on an OEM basis. Over the past year, however,
Stratus's business with IBM has flattened as IBM increasingly targets
'mission critical' applications with its own computers.
Stratus expects to expand its direct sales to more than compensate for the
IBM shortfall. The company is in particular targeting the emerging market
lligent networks' as deregulated telephone companies offer new services such
as store and forward facsimile, free-phone numbers and voice messaging
services.
Sequent Computer Systems' products, based upon the Intel line of
microprocessors running a version of the Unix operating system, demonstrate
the price and performance advantages that microprocessor-based parallel
processing has over traditional mainframes.
Sequent's Symmetry 2000 family of computers, introduced in January,
incorporates up to 30 of Intel's latest 486 microprocessors and achieves
mainframe class performance at what the company claims is an 80 per cent
price/performance advantage over other Unix mainframe computers and an even
greater edge over traditional proprietary mainframes.
The 8-year-old Sequent, with 1990 revenues of Dollars 249m, has built its
business upon automating applications that cannot be cost-effectively
handled by a mainframe computer. Examples range from a currency management
system for British Airways to an emergency room scheduling system for a
California hospital.
Pyramid Technology, another OLTP specialist, achieved a remarkable 73 per
cent growth in revenues in fiscal 1990, to reach Dollars 180m for the year
ending last September. Pyramid, of the Silicon Valley, is about to launch a
range of products based upon Mips Computer's RISC microprocessors.
While the niche players of the OLTP market are making inroads, the big
companies of the computer industry are not standing still. Unisys,
traditionally a large supplier of mainframe-based OLTP and also a re-seller
of Sequent computers, last week unveiled hardware and software products that
establish its strategic direction toward open-systems based OLTP.
Unisys expanded its product line with mid-range systems, which it will
manufacture in-house. Based on the Intel 486 with up to five processors, the
new Unisys 6000/65 has a peak performance of 118 MIPs and will run the
latest version of A T &amp; T's Unix, System V4.
Unisys also unveiled new Unix OLTP software including an improved version of
A T &amp; T's 'transaction manager' which will improve performance and
reliability, the company claims.
Digital Equipment's OLTP revenues grew by approximately 35 per cent to
Dollars 2.1bn in 1990, according to analysts at Hambrecht &amp; Quist, the San
Francisco investment bank.
Digital is emphasising fault tolerance. DEC launched its first specifically
fault-tolerant computers early last year but according to industry analysts
the products failed to have a significant impact on the market.
Last month, DEC unveiled its second generation fault tolerant products - a
new range of aggressively-priced VAX minicomputers designed for mission
critical applications which analysts predict will do much better.
Hewlett-Packard is also taking a stab at the fail-safe computer market
through an investment in Sequoia Systems, a small manufacturer of
fault-tolerant computers.
HP will resell Sequoia's machines and gain access to its technology. As
competition mounts, the OLTP market will become increasingly segmented,
analysts predict. Increasingly, the ability to perform OLTP will become a
prerequisite of commercial computing systems or all sizes.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (1): On the brink of
disaster - The effects of recent changes in the computer industry have been
shattering for many companies. Almost every mainframe or minicomputer
manufacturer in the US and Europe is demonstrating declining profitability,
if not actual losses. Alan Cane reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S large computer manufacturers have become used to rehearsing the
superficial reasons for the present crisis in the information technology
business, a malaise which has brought many of the best-known names in data
processing to the brink of disaster.
These include:
The spread of open systems, computer networks based on standard industry
components which cannot command the gross profit margins inherent in
proprietary designs. The gross margin built into a mainframe computer sale
can be 70 per cent or more; for PCs and workstations, it can be less than 30
per cent.
A seemingly never-ending decline in the cost and growth in the power of data
processing equipment which has further squeezed manufacturer's margins. A
high performance workstation can cost less than Dollars 1,000 for every
million instructions per second (mips) of computer power. Mainframes
typically cost more than Dollars 100,000 per mips. For many, but not all,
tasks it is possible to substitute low cost workstation power for mainframe
power.
The growing importance of service suppliers and systems integrators who put
together hardware and software from disparate sources to satisfy their
customers' requirements. New competitors for the traditional industry as a
result of this change include management consultancies such Anderson
Consulting and Price Waterhouse as well as software houses and value added
resellers.
A slackening in demand for computer systems which has been apparent in the
US for some time and is becoming evident in Europe. The reasons are complex;
they include saturation in some areas of the market, dissatisfaction with
the results of continued computerisation and, in the UK at least, high
interest rates.
The effects of these changes have been shattering for many companies. In the
US, Unisys, the result of a merger between Sperry and Burroughs only five
years old, lost Dollars 436.7m in 1990 and suspended payment of dividends on
both its common and preferred stock in an attempt to reduce debt which stood
at Dollars 3.7bn at the end of that year.
In Europe, Groupe Bull, the French state-owned manufacturer announced a loss
of Pounds 700m for 1990 and said the French government had agreed to provide
Pounds 400m in capital support to the company over 1991-92 in addition to
Pounds 270m earmarked for research and development into Bull's open systems
designs.
Unisys and Bull are simply the most spectacular victims of the sickness
affecting the industry; almost every mainframe or minicomputer company in
the US and Europe is demonstrating declining profitability if not actual
losses.
Earnings per share at IBM, the world's largest computer company, for
example, have been on a plateau for six years now. The company has spent
more time and money than most over the past three years in attempting to
bring its expenses into line with sales, but earlier this month it shook the
stock market with a warning that its sales in the first quarter of 1991
would be significantly weaker than expected; Wall Street analysts were
downcast after the company's apparently strong recovery in 1990.
The key to what is happening is the uneven nature of the picture. Suppliers
of PCs, workstations and high powered small systems have not been damaged to
anything like the same extent as mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers.
Compaq Computer, for example, the world leader in high powered PCs reported
sales in 1990 of Dollars 3.6bn, up 25 per cent from 1989, while net income
was Dollars 455m, up from Dollars 333m the previous year. Its growth was
chiefly driven by international sales, up 54 per cent, while revenues grew
only 5 per cent in the US.
Apple Computer, a PC pioneer which has tended to go its own way in
technological development, had comparatively stagnant sales and earnings in
1990, but began a spectacular turnaround after the launch of new,
aggressively priced computers featuring its proprietary 'Macintosh'
technology.
Pyramid Technology of the US which makes high performance mid-range
computers using the 'Unix' operating system increased revenues by 93 per
cent last year and its pre-tax profits by 110 per cent. The Pyramid machines
are colloquially described as 'Unix hot boxes'; for prices between Pounds
34,000 and Pounds 500,000, they will outperform a mainframe. Other hot box
suppliers include Arix and Sequent.
New players are entering the industry, often from unexpected directions.
Nippon Steel, for example, the world's largest steelmaking concern has
developed notebook computers which it is marketing in the US and Europe as
part of a broad plan to diversify into computers and communications.
All of this is evidence that the traditional computer business is being
displaced by a new industry, with which it has little in common, as surely
as the traditional Swiss watching making industry was brushed aside by
Japanese electronic timepiece manufacturers.
This new computer industry has its origin not in traditional data processing
but in the semiconductor industry and its expression in PCs and
workstations.
The traditional industry is characterised by proprietary computer designs
which lock customers into individual suppliers; prices are set to yield high
gross profit margins which are used to finance substantial direct sales
forces. These are the primary conduits between the manufacturer and the
customer. Applications software is developed chiefly by the customer's own
software staff, perhaps with the help of a software house.
The new industry is very different. Machine designs are similar between
suppliers because they are based on widely available, industry standard
microprocessors. Most of the research and development work has been carried
out by the semiconductor manufacturer. Compaq, for example, spends about
half the industry average on research and development.
Because margins are so narrow, direct sales forces are economically unviable
and sales take place principally through 'channels' - dealers, software
houses, value added resellers and systems integrators. The key to success,
as in the case of Compaq, is a strong positive relationship with the
channel.
Operating software is standard - usually a variation of the Unix system.
Applications software is packaged, developed by software specialists who
prefer to write programs which will run on a wide variety of machines rather
than tie themselves to a single manufacturer.
The question, therefore, is whether the members of the old industry are
sufficiently flexible to become new industry players, or whether they are
doomed to extinction. Against this background, arguments about the value of
state aid to national champions appear increasingly redundant.
At present, most experts agree that only IBM is safe; it has the
determination, flexibility and, most important, the financial security to
change course decisively.
The future of the Japanese mainframe manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and
NEC, IBM's chief competitors is unclear. They continue to prosper in their
fast growing home market, but have yet to face the challenge of open systems
and networked computing which is causing their Western competitors so much
heartache.
Swiss watchmakers found salvation in fashion. An equivalent safe haven for
the traditional computer industry is not yet in sight.

FT  23 APR 91 / (CORRECTED) Survey of The Computer Industry (11): Take your
partners and consolidate - UK, an industry still to be reckoned with
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 25th April 1991) appended to this article.
THE British computer industry is not what it once was.
International Computers Limited (ICL) is owned by Fujitsu, Apricot has sold
its computer hardware division to Mitsubishi, Sinclair Research is now part
of Mr Alan Sugar's Amstrad computer organisation and Acorn Computers has
long been part of the large Olivetti empire.
That does not mean that it is no longer a force to be reckoned with. Not
only have some British computer companies, notably Amstrad, survived the
market consolidations of the 1980s, but leading international manufacturing
facilities have come to the UK.
In addition, smaller, home-grown companies with innovative hardware and
software products, such as London-based Psion, have built their own
specialist markets.
This has taken place against a background of declining government investment
in high technology, the opening up of European markets in preparation for
1992 and the push for development of open computer systems.
ICL, for example, has been behind a push in both the public and private
sector over the past few years to encourage the use and evolution of
standard, open computer systems in the powerful mid-range and high-end mini
and mainframe sectors.
However, it seems that the open systems aren't always good news for UK
computer interests. According to Mr Tim Taylor, marketing director of
ACT-Logsys, it is open systems which played a large part in inducing Apricot
to sell its hardware division to Mitsubishi.
ACT-Logsys, a new company formed from a part of Apricot which was not sold
off, specialises in consultancy and support for large public and private
sector clients.
'One of the reasons we decided to find a partner for Apricot hardware was
that with standardisation and globalisation, it was getting much harder for
a UK supplier to survive on a worldwide scale,' says Mr Taylor.
That search for a partner eventually led to Mitsubishi buying the company.
He adds that the drive for standards has somewhat levelled the technology
playing field and is forcing many of the smaller players to move into
specialist markets to survive.
Ironically, as computer companies founded by British nationals have either
been sold or folded, international companies, such as Compaq Computer and
Connor Peripherals have moved in to take their places.
Compaq, in particular, has seen a spectacular rise to success for its UK
company - headed by Mr Joe McNally, UK-born managing director. Mr McNally
says that, in many ways, Compaq in the UK is just as much of a British
company as ICL had been.
Compaq has spent more than Dollars 76m on its Scottish manufacturing
facility in the past three years. Compaq has built up an annual UK turnover
in excess of Dollars 1bn thanks largely to a combination of the revenues
generated by the factory and the company's sales in the UK.
It was perhaps a sign of the times when Compaq found wholehearted and very
senior UK government support for location of the factory in Scotland -
although other Compaq European subsidiaries were lobbying heavily to have it
elsewhere.
Mr McNally recalls fondly one of the main elements in finally clinching the
deal to build in Scotland.
'Former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher personally put pen to paper and
wrote to our US chairman Mr Rod Canion,' says Mr McNally.
'That played an important role in terms of him deciding to come here -
although we did have a lot of support from the government and the Locate in
Scotland office,' adds Mr McNally.
He suggests that investing as heavily as it has in the UK has produced a
lift in sales to public sector bodies, which have in the past largely turned
to Apricot for their personal computers.
He says that public sector sales for Compaq in the rest of Europe account
for only 8 per cent of its business. In the UK, that figure has recently
risen to 18 per cent.
'Clearly the Scottish factory has been an influence,' he suggests. But while
Compaq is enjoying the benefits of increased public sector and corporate
sales, the recession has hit the lower end of the PC industry hard,
particularly in the retail sector.
IBM-compatible PCs have become commodity consumer electronics products and
suffer the same ups and downs as home fax systems, stereos and satellite
television. Amstrad, British electronics company, for example, is feeling
the bite of the recession.
'Business is not very good at the moment, but everyone is suffering,' admits
Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad founder and chairman. 'But that's no consolation.
It's been bloody slow and probably will be for the next six or seven months
 -even if interest rates drop 2 or 3 per cent. It was a bad January and
February and the satellite business suffered in February. Things are
starting to move again, but not in the volumes we had before Christmas,' he
says.
Mr Sugar, however, has bounced back many times before and is expected to
weather this recession well. At last month's CeBIT exhibition in Germany, he
bullishly announced three new products - designed to help lift his share of
the portables and small desktop computer markets and to pioneer
participation in the colour laptop computing sector.
Correction (published 25th April 1991).
IN TUESDAY'S computer industry survey, we suggested incorrectly that
Sinclair Research was part of the Amstrad organisation. In 1986, Amstrad
purchased the right to use the Sinclair trade name together with Sinclair's
intellectual property rights, patents and stocks of home computers. Sir
Clive Sinclair, however, retained ownership of Sinclair Research.

FT  22 APR 91 / Tunisia counts the cost of the Gulf war: Loss of tourism has
dealt a serious blow to the ailing economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GULF war has dealt a sharp blow to the economy of Tunisia.
The loss of foreign income from tourism and decline in domestic employment
come at a time when industrial growth had been resuming after three years of
drought, locust plagues and severe austerity.
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has pushed through measures aimed at
liberalising the management of Tunisia's economy, while maintaining
austerity.
A budget deficit equivalent to 8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1986
was turned into a surplus of 4 per cent last year but the Ministry of
Planning forecasts no increase in the country's GDP this year.
The government recognises that austerity is all the more necessary today and
has gone ahead with plans to cut five days' pay from all salaried workers.
The government expects exports of goods and services to suffer a shortfall
of TD850m (Dollars 895m), a figure which rises to more than TD1bn if the
loss of loans from Arab funds is included.
This year could turn out to be the first since independence when the number
of job losses is greater than the number of new jobs. The Ministry of
Planning estimates that 51,600 jobs will be lost and 48,000 created - this
at a time when 55,000 young Tunisians are entering the labour market every
year.
The social repercussions are grave. Ever more violent confrontations between
the police and Islamic fundamentalist militants from the major opposition
party, En Nahda (The Renaissance) has led to a climate in which the promises
of greater freedom of expression which accompanied President Ben Ali's
assumption of power have all but disappeared.
The fallout from the war is expected to cost the balance of payments TD600m.
The Tunisian government was quick to react and, three months ago, seized the
opportunity of a routine IMF review of the country's position to activate
the enlarged facility it had arranged with the Fund in 1988, but never drawn
down.
The IMF is expected to agree to Tunisia drawing SDR138m (Dollars 190m) - a
sum equivalent to its quota with the Fund.
Preliminary government estimates give loss of export income and suggest
three sectors will be badly affected:
Tourism and transport where half of Tunis Air's fleet is grounded - TD470m.
This figure is predicated on a 50 per cent decline in foreign visitors
during the first six months of the year; Exports of goods - TD330m of which
one third is accounted for by textiles;
Transfer payments - TD50m, the bulk of which are remittances from Tunisians
working abroad.
To these figures must be added the loss of TD200m worth of loans from
Kuwaiti and Arab development funds which will lead to the delay of major
projects.
A lower volume of imported capital goods and the decline in local spending
will cut the import bill by TD350m, but this will still add TD600m to
initial estimates of the balance of payments deficit.
The domestic economic consequences of the Gulf war will thus be severe,
despite the fact that an exceptionally plentiful rainfall should deliver a
very good crop, thus reducing the need to import cereals. This would be all
the more welcome as US aid has been cut by three-quarters.
The US Congress appeared somehat disgruntled at Tunisia's refusal to join
the coalition against Iraq. The benefits Morocco drew from sending troops to
the Gulf stand in sharp contrast - Saudi Arabia gave King Hassan Dollars
700m last autumn.
Although most sectors of the economy have felt the repercussions of the Gulf
war, tourism has been one of the immediate casualties. It accounts for
one-fifth of foreign earnings and ensures the livelihood of 800,000 people.
To a net loss of 13,500 jobs must be added the pressure on hotel owners to
shed labour if the number of foreign visitors does not pick up fast. In the
transport sector, job losses will amount to 2,700.
The construction industry is also likely to be affected since many new
hotels (Tunisia adds 5,000 beds every year) will not get the go-ahead.
The manufacturing sector, where only a third of the 15,000 new jobs planned
for 1991 will be created, could be further hit by an economic slowdown among
major client countries such as France.
The Tunisian government has been quick to draw up a list of capital
expenditure cuts and increase the price of certain items such as petrol.
If tourism picks up faster than expected, the government will be spared the
worse. If public frustration grows, however, the risks of social and
political unrest will be only too clear.

FT  22 APR 91 / Sun Alliance lends Aldington Pounds 500,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE insurance company, the UK's biggest household insurer, will
disclose in its annual report and accounts today that it has given an
interest-free loan, estimated at Pounds 500,000, to Lord Aldington, its
former chairman.
The loan is to cover the legal costs of his nine-week libel case against
Count Nikolai Tolstoy in 1989.
The directors justify the decision on the grounds that the case arose from
his duties as the company's chairman.
Earlier this month Sun Alliance reported a 1990 loss of Pounds 181m due to
claims arising from bad weather and the recession.
The loan to Lord Aldington is repayable if he recovers costs. The legal bill
has been estimated at Pounds 500,000 plus other expenses of about Pounds
100,000.
The company says that Mr Nigel Watts, a Kent property developer and a
co-defendant in the libel action, had claimed that Sun Alliance wrongly
refused to pay a Pounds 50,000 accident policy after his brother-in-law died
in 1975.
At the trial Lord Aldington's counsel said there had been a 'disgraceful
campaign' to force Sun Alliance to reverse its decision over the insurance
claim.
The court was told Mr Watts had circulated 10,000 copies of a pamphlet,
written by Count Tolstoy, attacking Lord Aldington's war record.
It alleged that as a senior officer in Austria at the end of the Second
World War he repatriated thousands of Cossacks and anti-Tito Yugoslavs to
the Communists knowing they faced torture and death.
At the end of the trial Lord Aldington, a former deputy chairman of the
Conservative party, was awarded record Pounds 1.5m damages plus costs but
neither Count Tolstoy nor Mr Watts were able to pay that sum.

FT  22 APR 91 / Economics Notebook: A challenging descent from heaven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WHEN Mr Detlev Rohwedder
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
assassinated head of the Treuhand agency charged with privatising East
German industry - resigned as state secretary of the German Economics
Ministry in 1980, he left to run a steel company.
As announced last week, Sir Peter Middleton, who is resigning as permanent
secretary of the UK Treasury next month, will move to the City as a director
and deputy chairman of the Barclays Bank group and to head Barclays'
newly-formed markets and investment banking division.
Once in the Square Mile, he will be rubbing shoulders with other ex-Treasury
knights. Sir Geoffrey Littler, one of Sir Peter's former deputies, was
appointed last week to be chairman of NatWest Investment Bank. Sir Douglas
Wass, Sir Peter's immediate predecessor as permanent secretary, is
co-chairman of Nomura International.
The amakudari, or 'descent from heaven', of these eminent gentlemen will
doubtless gild their final working years. But what does it tell us about
Britain, and is it good news for the country?
Just as Downing Street was announcing Sir Peter's departure from the
Treasury, the Confederation of British Industry reported a sharp fall in
industry's research and development since 1988.
The report showed that industry-funded R&amp;D in Britain, in proportion to
output, was about half Japanese and German levels.
The coincidence of these two news items gives powerful backing to an
argument put forward earlier this year by Mr Walter Eltis, the director
general of the National Economic Development Office*, to the effect that
Britain's poor investment record in manufacturing and fragile international
competitiveness can be partly linked to too great a concentration of
national effort in the areas of finance and banking.
Mr Eltis cited figures showing that investment in financial services in
Britain rose 313 per cent in volume terms between 1979 and 1990 while
investment in manufacturing barely rose at all. In the 11 years, financial
sector investment as a share of total investment in plant and machinery rose
to 29.4 per cent from 11.7 per cent.
But while the UK had put a 'great many eggs into the financial basket', the
recent history of UK banking had exposed miscalculations and weaknesses such
as the catalogue of loss-making decisions at the Midland Bank.
Mr Eltis concluded that excessive inflation, poor real rates of return and a
pro-housing bias in the UK's financial institutions had also crimped
investment. But 'the impact on the direction of investment of an apparently
hyper-profitable City, the superiority of which now appears in part
illusory' was a factor.
Worryingly, Mr Eltis suggests that the recent woes in UK banking and
insurance cast doubt over the ability of Britain's financial sector to reap
the promised harvest of the Europrean single market. It will be up to Sir
Peter Middleton and the other mature madarins who make a bee-line for the
City to prove him wrong.
****
A bias in favour of finance is not an exclusively British preserve. When Mr
Jacques Attali, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, sought a vehicle to turn his vision of a united European
economic area stretching from the Urals to the coast of Portugal into
reality, he thought of a bank.
At last week's inauguration of the EBRD in London, there were plenty of
people suggesting that a better way of helping eastern and central Europe
move to democracy and develop the market economy would be for the west to
lower trade barriers to products in which the former communist countries
have a comparative advantage.
In Washington last week, the Czechoslovak foreign minister Mr Jiri
Dienstbier was giving the same message to President George Bush.
The progress being made towards reaching association agreements between the
European Community and Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia shows that the EC
is responding to these pressures. In London last week, Mr Henning
Christophersen, an EC Commission member, acknowledged that the former
communist states 'had no real economic prospects' without free access to the
industrial world's markets.
This view was echoed by Mr Attali, who said the EBRD would prepare a
strategy for opening up trade relations between east and west. What this
would entail was unclear, however. Like much else concerning the business
operations of the EBRD, it is a question of wait and see.
****
Is the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ripe for
expansion? A South Korean delegation will visit the OECD this week for talks
about joining the 24-nation Paris-based economic think tank of
industrialised countries.
Mexico is also a likely candidate, while several east European countries
have also expressed an interest in joining.
New members are only admitted to the club with the unanimous agreement of
existing members. South Korea's human rights record could pose problems. But
it is a member of the EBRD which has the promotion of pluralism and
democracy among its goals.
